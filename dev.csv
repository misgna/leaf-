4518,https://essayforum.com/writing/hosting-international-sports-effects-given-93833/,dev,Essay about hosting an international sports and how it effects a given country,"Essay: \n Recently, another country is chosen to organize a national competition of sport, which brings a lot of profits for this nation. A school of thought holds that an appointed host gives many negative effects on the event. This essay will discuss both views before drawing a reasoned conclusion. \n On the one hand, becoming a host of national sports events is an honor for one country, the reason for this is that many audiences all over the world will realize this nation through sports competitions. Plenty of countries nowadays endeavor to attract organizers to be selected to appoint a host. For example, Cambodia attempted to invest in building many affordable courses for sports in order to appeal to SEA games' organizers. In addition, an advantage for the host is their players easily adapted to the game when the events take place, thereby winning with less trouble. Therefore, hosting a sports event will get more benefits than other countries. \n On the other hand, the difficulty of a host is responsibility. Some countries just concentrate on the formal appearance of events but they do not focus on the quality of organizing the competition. As a result, various referees cannot have enough standards to assess some difficult fouls in another match. Furthermore, many native players tend to cheat in the game like using dopping because they think that the host will assure safety for their mistake. Consequently, numerous countries are not appreciated by audiences due to their dishonesty in the event. \n To conclude, while appointing a host is the glory of one country, putting responsibility in the highest position is vital. It is recommended for the host country should be sincere in international sports events.","There is an error in the approach of the writer to the given discussion. He has decided to disregard the ""international sports events"" reference in favor of his own ""national sports events"". This will definitely make the essay fail in the preliminary task scoring because the discussion foundation is incorrect even as the topic remains the same. In addition, the writer also does not restate the prompt topic as expected, creating a confusing representation of the original, which means this essay has already received an overall failing score even before the rest of the essay considerations have received marks. The final writing approach error is that rather than offering an opinion, the writer decided to offer a conclusion. A decision that he feels the reader should accept, which was not the original writing instruction for the writer's opinion section. So the writer has made mistake after mistake in the first paragraph, which continued in his discussion paragraphs. Nothing about the writing of this error is correct nor worth a passing score. I do not see the need to review this essay beyond the prompt restatement + writer's opinion at this point since the essay does not have a passing score chance anyway.","Your essay attempts to explore the advantages and disadvantages of hosting sports events, which is a relevant and engaging topic. However, it's important to carefully address the essay prompt. The prompt specifically mentions ""international sports events,"" but your essay shifts focus to ""national sports events."" This deviation from the prompt significantly affects the alignment of your essay with the expected discussion, impacting your essay's performance right from the start.

Furthermore, the introduction of your essay fails to accurately restate the essay prompt, leading to potential confusion about the topic you are discussing. A clear and accurate restatement of the essay prompt is essential for setting the stage for your arguments and ensuring the reader understands the context of your discussion.

Another key point is that your conclusion appears to provide a prescribed solution or decision rather than presenting your personal opinion on the subject as expected. The task typically looks for your perspective, encouraging you to share your own stance on the issue rather than concluding what should be done.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several points where your essay could benefit from improvements:

1. Be mindful of spelling ""dopping"" should be ""doping,"" and pay attention to word choice to enhance clarity.
2. You tend to use phrases that could be simplified for clearer communication. For example, ""a school of thought holds that"" could be simplified to ""some people believe that.""
3. In some instances, your essay lacks specificity in its arguments, making it harder for the reader to fully grasp the point you're trying to make. For example, when discussing the responsibilities of the host country, providing more detailed examples could strengthen your argument.
4. The structure of sentences and the flow of ideas could be smoother, enhancing the overall readability of your essay.

Despite these areas for improvement, you do present an interesting discussion on the potential benefits and drawbacks of hosting sports events, highlighting aspects like recognition and the pressure of responsibility on the host country. Moving forward, consider aligning your essay closely with the prompt, improving your argument's clarity and specificity, and refining your grammar and style for a more polished submission.

Your viewpoint within the essay does come through; however, ensuring it is presented as a personal perspective rather than a universal solution will align better with the expected approach. By addressing these points, your essay has the potential to offer a more compelling and accurate exploration of the topic.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4519,https://essayforum.com/writing/universities-colleges-offering-qualifications-94200/,dev,Universities and colleges are now offering qualifications through online learning - pros and cons,"By the turn of the 21st century, the Covid 19 pandemic brought enormously detrimental impacts on human life, which led to the development of studying and working on the Internet. Some undergraduates nowadays prefer receiving qualifications through learning online to learning directly from teachers in class. In my opinion, the benefits gained from this phenomenon are more than the drawbacks. \n Through distance studying, young people could benefit from tremendous advantages. First and foremost, as the epidemic grew, schools and teachers take responsibility to apply new learning methods - online teaching. As a result, the preparations for lessons including brief presentations are mustered more. Moreover, it is the combination of various smart modern technological devices and digital apps that helps college students study easier and more effectively, as pupils could quickly look for useful information and detailed explanations. \n The second advantage is the quality of the teacher's speaking sound and teaching presentation because studying through the Internet helps shorten the geographical distance and is like having a face-to-face tutor. Because each classroom has vast sittings with a large number of young people, but only one educator and not all learners could have a close seat to teachers. Consequently, numerous undergraduates find it difficult to catch up with the lessons and earned good results for their degrees. For instance, there are a variety of social media or group communication apps nowadays such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams,...providing the best fast and best features for youngsters. \n On the other hand, these digital devices, social communications, or intriguing games distract youngsters from important studying and become dependent on them. Furthermore, spending various of time online can cause prejudiced effects on physical and mental health causing bad-qualified workers in the future, especially in the Covid 19. \n In conclusion, the advantage of using technology for online teaching outweigh the disadvantage because of its convenience and quality for studying preparation. By combing two types of learning methods online and offline, undergraduate students could gain more effective knowledge to prepare for the qualification of their major.","While some people truly type quite fast and could manage to click off a series of sentences within the 40 minute writing frame, that does not mean that the essay will get a passing score, or that the essay has been properly discussed. It is not the word count that will help you pass the test, it the quality of your reasoning presentation and proper use of English grammar rules that will count the most. Most importantly, the essay should stick to the standard 4 paragraph writing format. It will always be better for your score if you write clearly and explain yourself convincingly in an essay of 250-275 words. Sometimes, it is possible to write 300 words, but then the quality of the essay often suffers when the student aims for that number. \n Your English grammar is good for the most part. This shows a high intelligence and proper control over English words and its usage. However, it also shows that you have a tendency to overdiscuss things when all the essay requires is a simple, yet convincing discussion presentation. Keep it short but clear. Do not focus on showing off your vocabulary, LR scoring and GRA is only a part of the test. The highest scores are obtained in the TA and C+C sections which, in this case, could have been better achieved. \n By the way, your vocabulary usage focus left you open to several GRA deductions caused by improper punctuation usage, lack of proper simple, complex, and compound sentences, along with improper use of conjunctions. All of these errors will leave your essay with a high degree of deductions and in the process, a lower, but not failing, overall score. Provided you would have been able to complete such a long essay within the 40 minute time allottment that is.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the coherence, effectiveness, and language accuracy of the essay. These improvements will not only make the arguments more convincing but also align the essay more closely with exam expectations. 

**Alignment with Topic and Structure:**
The essay adequately responds to the given topic by discussing the benefits and drawbacks of online learning. Nevertheless, adhering to a more structured format, such as the recommended four-paragraph format, would help in organizing ideas more clearly. This entails an introduction, two paragraphs for the body (one discussing benefits and the other discussing drawbacks), and a conclusion. Keeping the essay within the suggested word limit of 250-275 words would also focus the discussion, preventing overextension into less relevant details.

**Language Use and Style:**
While the essay showcases a broad vocabulary, there's a tendency to over-elaborate. Simplicity, clarity, and precision in language are more valuable than demonstrating extensive vocabulary. This focus will improve the essay's readability and ensure arguments are direct and engaging. Additionally, attention should be given to grammar, punctuation, and the proper use of sentence structures. Varied sentence structures (simple, complex, and compound) and correct conjunction use are essential for a higher score. Avoid excessive punctuation and aim to express ideas succinctly to avoid confusion and maintain the reader's interest.

**Clarity of Arguments:**
The point of view is generally clear, supporting the benefits of online learning. Yet, the arguments can be made stronger and more descriptive by providing specific examples and ensuring each claim is directly supported by evidence. This not only reinforces the position taken but also helps the reader to understand and be persuaded by your perspective.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. Restructure the essay to follow the four-paragraph format for clearer argument progression.
2. Focus on clarity and simplicity in language rather than showcasing vocabulary.
3. Use varied sentence structures and correct grammatical constructions to enhance coherence and readability.
4. Ensure arguments are well-supported with specific examples or evidence.
5. Pay attention to maintaining a balanced discussion of both benefits and drawbacks, as this will contribute to a more rounded and persuasive essay.

Among several skills, it is one of the most important ability to plan and organize works. Some people does not believe that it is necessary for children to equip with this skill, but I disagree with this opinion. These are the reasons why I agree with the argument it is not essential for young generation to have the ability to plan and organize. \n To begin with, children need to manage their various roles effectively and this skill is expected to teach young people to manage their diverse responsibilities. To be specific, they play some roles in each different situation. For instance, they are a son or daughter in their house, a friend with their classmates, and a student in front of their teacher. To manage their a wide range of roles successfully, children have to learn the ability to plan and organize their tasks. \n In addition, it is the best time to train these skills because young people are likely to learn fast and form their habit. As modern society has been filled with complicated issues, it is required for all people to have strong management skills. But, the problem is that this kind of capabilities cannot nurtured for one day, but should be trained for a long time. On the other hands, children have a tendency to learn something quickly and absorb the genuine skills faster than adult because they have few stereotypes about learning something new. Furthermore, childhood is the period that they form their own habits, children can easily use this time to develop their management skills. \n To wrap up, I support the opinion it is essential for young people to have ability to plan and organize because children also need to manage their various roles and it is good timing to train them to gain these abilities. In other words, the skills for management will be beneficial to children and childhood could be used to build their own habits. That is why I agree with the opinion that it is necessary for young people to nurture that skills.","Dear student, you have neglected to perform the most important part of writing an academic essay test. That is, you did not read what you wrote before you submitted the work for scoring consideration. I will focus on this major error on your part in this essay instead of the other mistakes that you made because the mistake that you made in your opinion discussion will result in a failing score for your essay. \n To quote, you said that; ""... I agree with the argument it is <b>not</b> essential ..."" So you are saying that you do not agree that the ability to plan and organize is essential in the life of young people. Yet, in the overall context of the essay, as well as your concluding paragraph, what you indicate is; ""... <b>I support</b> the opinion..."" and also state that; ""I <b>agree</b> with the opinion"" Which is it? It is either you support or do not support the statement. You cannot suddenly change your statement at the end. \n This is a mistake that could have been avoided had you allotted enough time to review your essay prior to submission. You need to learn how to plan your writing so that you have enough time to edit yourself if necessary towards the end of the allotted time. Constantly reviewing of the content is necessary if you are to create a well developed, coherent, and logically presented essay to the examiner. That is the method by which you can target a higher score than usual in the end. \n Sadly, the work that you did in this essay is sloppy and shows a lack of proper analyzing and thinking on your end in terms of the discussion points provided in the original instruction.

However, there are several areas that need improvement to strengthen your essay and clarify your argument.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay suggests you support the importance of planning and organizing skills for children, but there's a significant contradiction in your stance. Initially, you state you disagree with the necessity of these skills for children, but later your essay supports the opposite view. This confusion undermines the clarity and effectiveness of your argument. It's crucial to maintain a consistent position throughout your essay to effectively convey your message.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases. For example, ""Some people does not believe"" should be ""Some people do not believe,"" and ""...capabilities cannot nurtured for one day..."" should be ""...capabilities cannot be nurtured in one day..."". Attention to subject-verb agreement and proper sentence structure is essential. Additionally, simplifying complex sentence structures can enhance the clarity of your arguments.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The mixed messages in your essay make your point of view confusing. To make your standpoint clear, decide if you believe planning and organizing skills are essential for children and consistently argue that perspective throughout your essay. Clear and direct statements about your position will make your essay more persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay contains examples and reasons why planning and organizing skills might be beneficial for children. However, these arguments are overshadowed by the conflicting statements regarding your position on the topic. Focus on developing clear, descriptive arguments that consistently support your stance. Also, ensure your examples directly illustrate the benefits of planning and organizing skills to strengthen your argument.

**To Improve Your Essay**:
- Carefully review your essay before submitting it to ensure your arguments are consistent and clearly support your point of view.
- Work on grammar, especially subject-verb agreement and sentence structure, to improve readability.
- Ensure your position on the essay topic is clear from the beginning and consistently supported throughout the essay.

In fact, there are some differences between high schools and colleges that help students know how to decide to continue futher study or start working. According to each distinctive features, there are three main aspects need to discuss: applying method, relationships, and students' attitude. \n To begin with, the teaching technique is the most easy point to distinguish high shools and colleges. On one hand, teachers and students in high schools totally follow the offical schedules and textbooks. In that way, teachers must take huge responsibility of helping, even enforcing students to have good knowledge and students try their best to do what teachers told them to do. Generally, it is a one- sided technique, teachers give information to students and they just have to do those work. On the other hand, universities focus on interactive and self-study technique. That gives students right to show their opinions and get the feedback also. Teachers play a different role, they are instructors who offer guidance, resources, and feedback for the anwers students aks them. Then students have to do the rest on their own. It seems that this way is more open and flexible than the way of high schools using. \n Next, relationships also have huge differences. Most students study high schools at their hometown, so their friends are tend to be very familiar and close to them. For instance, a girl has just finished secondary school then moves on high school properly makes friends with people she has known before in secondary school. In contrast, universities include a wide range of different students from different places, so it is much easier to adapt this change and make friends with strange students. Manybe it would be hard in the first time, but everything new starts take time and that also gives students chances to overcome problems as well. \n Last but not least is about attitude. Due to the feature of high schools structure that focus mainly on rules, students mostly are enforced to do he tasks by other people, such as their parents, siblings, teachers,etc. As a result, they have to do their best to accomplish all the give work unwillingly. Their main thought when they do those work is an obligation. Nevertheless, students in universities have more choices and more responsibilities as well. They not only have right to manage their lives on their own but also take care of themselves and set goals as well as commit to complete it on time. The more choices or rights students have, the more responsibilities they must take. \n In conclusion, the teaching and learning mothod, connection, and awareness are three proninent features that differ between high schools and universities. In near future, to adapt the creative and productive trend of the world, high schools may apply universities' style and help more students develop themselves more logically and effectively.","when you write a comparison essay, it is always best to limit the discussion to one common topic. That makes it easier for you to create a 3 paragraph discussion that will keep the reader focused on your supporting facts rather than jumping around from topic to topic as you did in this essay. Your reader will be forced to keep track of all of your discussions, which do not flow smoothly as you do not have transition sentences in between paragraphs. That makes it difficult to actually consider all of the discussion points as you set them out in the essay. Since this is to be written as a compare and contrast essay (you cannot contrast without comparing) the paragraph body should be represented as: \n 1. Comparison statement \n 2. Contrasting statement \n Basically, an essay such as this one can be completed within 4 paragraphs if written in a manner that best represents the clearest discussion for the prompt. I wish you had included the original instructions instead of just giving me the essay to read. I would have been able to offer a more target set of advice if you had done that.","The essay provides a comparison between high schools and universities in Vietnam, focusing on their roles in the education system. The author attempts to highlight differences in teaching methods, relationships, and student attitudes. While the effort to cover these aspects is commendable, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make it more effective and engaging for the reader.

Firstly, it's important to ensure that the essay stays focused on a central topic. When comparing two elements, like high schools and universities in this case, it's beneficial to structure the essay in a way that makes it easy for readers to follow the discussion. Ideally, this could involve organizing the essay into four paragraphs where you first present what high schools and universities have in common and then delve into how they differ. This structure would help maintain a clear and focused argument throughout the essay.

Additionally, the transition between paragraphs in the essay lacks smoothness. Including transition sentences could significantly improve the flow of the essay, helping guide the reader from one point to the next without confusion. This is crucial for keeping the reader engaged and making sure your points are clearly understood.

As for the language and style, there are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For example, it's important to spell words correctly (e.g., ""shools"" should be ""schools"", ""anwers"" should be ""answers"") and use grammatically correct structures. Also, avoiding overly complicated sentences can make the essay easier to read, especially for an audience that may also be English language learners.

The points of view and arguments could be more effectively communicated with clear and concise language, as well as the addition of specific examples to support your statements. While you mentioned different teaching methods, relationships, and attitudes in high schools and universities, providing clear examples could make these differences more tangible and convincing to the reader.

Finally, consider reflecting on the student's responsibility and autonomy in both high schools and universities more deeply. These are important points, and further exploration could add more depth to your essay. It would also be helpful to critically analyze how these differences impact students' learning and development.

In summary, by focusing on a clear structure, smoothing transitions between paragraphs, addressing spelling and grammatical errors, and fleshing out arguments with specific examples, you can significantly improve your essay. This approach will not only make your writing more compelling but also ensure your readers remain engaged and fully grasp the points you're trying to make.",3,3,3,4,4,3,1,3,4,1,Analytical
4522,https://essayforum.com/writing/causes-solutions-global-hunger-importance-88120/,dev,Causes and solutions to global hunger - the importance of agricultural technology,"It is true that a large number of people suffer from hunger nowadays despite the breakthrough humans have achieved in agriculture. Poverty and climate change are two important reasons and some measures can be taken to alleviate the crisis. \n One of the main reasons why people go hungry is that they cannot afford the food. Most starving people live in extreme poverty. They do not have enough arable land to grow sufficient food to supply themselves, and they earn so little income from work (if they are employed) to afford purchased food from other sources when their own supply runs out. Moreover, climate change and extreme weather have a detrimental effect on agricultural production. For example, it is reported that drought is attributed to more than eighty percent of the total damage in agriculture. Lack of basic infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, in some African drought-stricken areas, aggravates the situation, so farmers in these areas are more likely to suffer from food shortage. \n However, some actions can be taken to tackle these problems. Firstly, it requires collective efforts from the international community to ensure that children in disadvantaged regions have access to education. Only by acquiring basic skills such as reading, writing, and numeracy can they grow up into mature, skilled, and qualified adults. In this way, they have a chance to seek employment or start their own enterprise. Secondly, developed countries should feel obligated to aid impoverished countries by sharing agricultural technology and financial resources with them, therefore, they are able to conduct researches about how to transform agriculture and make sustainable food. \n To conclude, agricultural technology sharing from developed countries and ensuring access to education will be crucial to mitigating global hunger.","The original prompt is not asking you to attest to the truthfulness of the topic being presented for discussion.

Education has nothing to do with the discussion because you did not properly defend its relationship to the topic.

There needs to be a clear relationship between the problems previously presented and applicable solutions in the next paragraph. \n You need at least 40 words in the concluding summary. Your run-on sentence, which does not properly summarize the discussion, will be the final reason for the low score for this presentation.","Your essay addresses an important topic - the issue of global hunger despite advancements in agriculture. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the response and ensure it meets the criteria of the given task more effectively.

1. Topic Response: It is essential to directly address the prompt without adding personal opinions unless specifically asked. The essay begins with a subjective statement, which might distract from the prompt's requirements. Focus on restating the prompt and providing direct responses to the questions or topics provided. This clarity will significantly impact the overall coherence and relevance of your essay.

2. Clarity and Development of Ideas: The transition between topics within paragraphs appears abrupt. For instance, the discussion shifts from the general inability of people to afford food to the specific challenges faced by farmers without clear linkage or explanation. This jump can leave readers confused and render the argument underdeveloped. Each paragraph should focus on a single, coherent idea with sufficient evidence and explanation to support your statements. Avoid introducing new topics without thoroughly exploring the ones already mentioned.

3. Connection Between Problems and Solutions: The solutions proposed, such as education and technology sharing, while valuable, lack a direct connection to the problems described earlier in the essay. When suggesting solutions, explicitly connect them back to the problems to make a solid argument. For example, if suggesting education as a solution, clearly explain how education could help solve the problem of food affordability or agricultural production issues caused by climate change. This connection is critical for the reader to understand the relevance and effectiveness of your proposed solutions.

4. Conclusion: The conclusion of an essay serves as a summary of the main points discussed and should reiterate the significance of what has been argued. A single, run-on sentence in the conclusion does not provide a comprehensive summary of the discussion. Aim to expand your concluding paragraph to fully encapsulate your arguments and reinforce the essay's main message.

Spelling and grammar are generally good, though always remember to proofread for minor errors or typos. Continuing to enhance your grammatical precision and usage of stylistic elements will only serve to strengthen your writing.

In summary, ensure your essay directly addresses the prompt, maintain clarity and coherence throughout, explicitly connect problems with their solutions, and provide a comprehensive conclusion.

For certain reasons, I believe this point of view is likely to be disagreed. \n Based on the fact that cars are now the dominant choice of vehicles in the world, investing in roads is, indeed, one of the top solutions for the rate of car accidents. In particular, the quality of roads, especially high-way, has shown significant impacts in reducing accidents that happened due to wheel-strip, blocking-objects,... The more people choosing cars as their vehicle, the more responsibility the Governments are facing to guarantee their safety on the roads. \n Having said that there are some who still agree because they think better railways would somehow encourage people to use public transportation, such as trains. However, it is its convenience, of which time-flexibility and time-saving, comes along with the privacy of personal vehicles that make cars way more common than trains. Therefore, spending on railways can be considered as not efficient, when the roads are more urgent to be invested. \n Furthermore, the process of putting a train into running not just includes only qualified railways, but also a whole complex system of the workforce, energy, and engineering platform that needs to be maintained. By that, investing in railways turns out to cost the Government much more money than that on roads. The national resources can be saved just by spending on improving roads instead of railways. \n To sum up, I believe there are more reasons to disagree with this statement. In the next decade, roads will still need a concentration of government investment, until cars stop being the number one vehicle chosen.","Your response to the question is incorrect. This is an extent essay. Therefore, a measured response with proper reasoning is required for the paraphrased presentation. You are also creating a misrepresentation of the original prompt by using the phrase "" widely argued"". There is no argument being presented nor referred to in the original presentation. It is a mere suggestion or discussion, which would have been the more appropriate descriptive words to use in your rephrasing.

An opposite suggestion has also been made that cash should be allowed more for the building of thoroughfares. I disagree completely with the former idea due to the degree by which private vehicles are more beneficial to people, thus requiring more roadway than train lines.</em> \n Your opening paraphrase is incorrect in terms of formatting. You are missing one more sentence to meet the minimum requirement. Your concluding paragraph does not offer a clear summary of the previous discussion, which is the required format presentation of the concluding paraphrase.

While the attempt to address the topic is noticed, the essay's alignment with the given topic could be enhanced. Specifically, the introduction of the topic as ""widely argued"" could be more accurately described. The discussion is not about an ongoing argument but rather exploring a suggestion or consideration regarding government investment priorities. A more fitting approach could be to frame the discussion as weighing different suggestions on where national leaders should focus their financial efforts, such as in the building of train tracks versus thoroughfares. 

In terms of structure and clarity, the essay could benefit from a clearer paraphrase in the introduction and a more concise summary in the conclusion. The introduction should succinctly present the essay's stance without ambiguity, ideally adding another sentence for a fuller representation. The conclusion, on the other hand, should clearly encapsulate the essay's main arguments, offering a rounded summary rather than opening up new discussions. 

Regarding content, the essay presents a perspective favoring road investment due to the prevalent use of personal vehicles and the high cost associated with railway investment. While these points do contribute to the argument, the essay could be strengthened by providing more detailed reasoning and examples to support its claims. It is mentioned, for example, that road quality significantly affects car accidents, but expanding on how government investment could specifically improve road safety would make the argument more compelling.

There are also some grammatical and stylistic issues to address. Avoid vague terms like ""certain reasons,"" ""some who still agree,"" and strive for precision in language to make arguments more persuasive. Additionally, the readability of the essay could be improved by avoiding ellipses and ensuring a consistent use of commas for clarity.

Lastly, the essay’s point of view is clear, but it might benefit the argument to acknowledge counterpoints more thoroughly before refuting them. This would demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic and enhance the overall persuasiveness of the essay.

For example, the combination of the words ""a, beautiful, girl"" forms the noun phrase ""a beautiful girl"". When teaching foreign languages, I encourage students to combine and expand sentences in English to understand semantic relationships. \n Third, the syntax course helps me understand the analysis of complex sentence structures. Tree diagrams show the hierarchical and semantic relationships between word classes. When teaching, I incorporate other subjects into the lecture, trying to simplify the knowledge so that it is easy for students to understand and absorb.","Refer to yourself throughout the essay. You may refer to yourself as I, me, myself. or variations thereof. Do not use the first person pronoun you because the paper does not reflect the learning of other people in the course. It refers only to your learning. Change all the you references to I, or other personal pronoun references. You should also change learning time references to past tense since you have already completed and learned from the course. Your thoughts with regards to what you learned in the course is understandable. You get your point across clearly enough. There are some points that could be cleaned up or better presented. Unfortunately, I am unable to edit those sections here.","Your essay provides a structured reflection on how the syntax course has contributed to your understanding and teaching of foreign languages. The progression from basic grammar knowledge to complex sentence analysis is clear. However, to make your essay more effective and responsive to the essay topic, consider the following points:

1. **Perspective:** Throughout your essay, using the pronoun ""you"" may confuse readers since the essay is about your personal learning experience. Switching ""you"" to ""I"" or other personal pronouns will make the essay more personal and clearer. For instance, rather than writing ""When teaching foreign languages, I reinforce old knowledge for students,"" you could say, ""When I teach foreign languages, I reinforce my old knowledge, encouraging my active learning.""

2. **Tense Consistency:** Reflect on the tense you're using. Since the essay discusses what you have learned, shifting to the past tense for actions completed during the course may improve clarity. For example, instead of ""helps me review basic grammar knowledge,"" consider ""helped me review my basic grammar knowledge.""

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay is largely free from significant spelling and grammatical errors, which is excellent. However, watch for phrases that could be simplified or clarified to enhance understanding. For example, ""the number of words in English, their usage, and position in the sentence"" could be more concise. Consider rephrasing for clarity and brevity without losing meaning.

4. **Clarity of Arguments:** Your points about benefiting from the syntax course are generally well-made. Enhancing their clarity with more personal reflections and specific examples from your experience would make your points stronger and more relatable. For instance, sharing a specific instance when understanding syntax improved your ability to teach a complex grammar rule.

5. **Position or Point of View:** Your position as someone who has gained valuable insights and skills from the syntax course is evident. To strengthen this further, conclude your essay by summarizing how these insights have transformed or impacted your teaching approach.

Remember, incorporating personal pronouns correctly and reflecting on your experiences in the past tense can make your essay more relatable and coherent. It's also beneficial to provide specific examples to support your statements, making your reflections more vivid and convincing. Improving these areas will significantly enhance the quality of your essay and effectively communicate your learning journey.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Narrative
4525,https://essayforum.com/writing/discuss-opposing-views-animals-held-captivity-89843/,dev,Discuss 2 opposing views on whether the animals should be held in captivity or free in wilderness,"In this day and age, there are so many animals in threat of extinction that human beings must take a look at their behaviors towards the natural species. Therefore, it is suggested that zoos or other kinds of captivity should be called off properly. Paradoxically, it is also said that should mankind hold the animals in captivity, the benefits of that will apply to both sides. \n Regarding the school of thought holding the belief that the animals need to stay in their natural habitats, the most evident advantage of this is to avoid becoming a way of recreation for humans. For example, many endangered species have been captured to be a part of the performance in many circuses around the world. They have to engage in various dangerous actions involving such things like fire or swords, which may lead to death. Moreover, humans today are still capturing rare animals for various industrial purposes, namely making designers or following some unscientific medical recipes. \n On the other hand, the opposing debate which believes in the benefits gained from holding animals in captivity has been taken into account. In recent years, the number of natural habitats such as tropical forests or the ocean has been reduced due to global warming and other factors, thereby making many species lose their homes. Therefore, some countermeasures should be taken such as giving them artificial environments which have the same essences as their natural ones. In addition, some animals are way too weak to put up with other predators, let alone the newborn ones. As a result, these species must be held in captivity and receive care by specialists in order to survive. \n Overall, as far as I am concerned, there are some certain animals which are endangered and need to be kept in zoos so as not to be extinct. However, others should be in the wilderness, thus developing in their own way and not being in control of human beings.","<quotation>called off properly</quotation> \n What do you mean by this statement? The reference is not clear. Did you mean zoos should be closed? something got lost, the meaning of the sentence got lost in translation. \n <quotation>some countermeasures should be taken</quotation> \n This will not be considered by the examiner when scoring the essay. It is not part of the discussion requirements. The number of words this discussion used will be deducted from the current word count. If the result is less than 250 words, then word deductions will apply. \n <quotation>as far as I am concerned,</quotation> \n Where did this come from? The original prompt asks for 3 discussion paragraphs, inclusive of your personal opinion. Yet, you did not give a personal opinion in the thesis statement. Neither did you develop this as the required 3rd paragraph discussion. The examiner will not accept this presentation in the concluding summary. The discussion format is partially incorrect due to the erroneous placement of the personal opinion. This will lower the TA score of your presentation and affect the C+C score of your essay.","Your essay on the role of zoos and captivity in safeguarding animals from extinction addresses a critical issue and presents both sides of the argument. However, there are areas that can be improved to make your essay clearer and more effective.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
You successfully address the topic by discussing two opposing viewpoints on animal captivity. However, your conclusive stance—where you express your personal view—is introduced abruptly at the end. Remember, an essay should build up to your viewpoint throughout, especially in a format that requires a discussion followed by your opinion. Introducing your stance earlier or more gradually could make your argument more compelling.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
There are a few phrases and choices of words that lead to confusion or weaken the impact of your sentences. For example, ""called off properly"" could be more clearly conveyed as ""should be closed or phased out."" Ensuring clarity in your language will help your readers understand your arguments without confusion.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
Your point of view becomes clear only in the concluding part of the essay. A stronger thesis statement at the beginning, stating that the essay will examine both sides before expressing a personal viewpoint, would help. Offering a hint of your perspective early on can guide the reader and prepare them for the conclusion you eventually draw.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:**
You provide examples and reasons to support both sides of the argument, which is good. However, the discussion on countermeasures for protecting animals in their natural habitat seems a bit off-topic for the essay prompt. Focus on offering vivid descriptions and specific examples directly related to the advantages and disadvantages of zoos and captivity. Avoid diverting into areas not directly asked for in the prompt, as it could affect the relevance of your essay.

In summary, your essay effectively initiates a discussion on a vital topic. To improve, work on introducing your personal stance earlier in the essay, clarify your language for better understanding, and ensure all arguments directly relate to the central question of zoos and captivity's role in preventing animal extinction. By refining these areas, your essay will be more coherent, persuasive, and aligned with the requirements.",4,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4526,https://essayforum.com/writing/traditional-subjects-modern-approach-prepare-90798/,dev,Traditional subjects or a more modern approach to prepare students for today's world challenges,"Topic \n . \n In such a developing and fast-paced society, many education systems still firmly believe that their attentiveness towards academic performance would hold the key and drive their student's life. Therefore, many students are yet to provide true-to-life skills. In my opinion, this belief needs debunking. Hence, I'd gravitate towards the agreement side. \n As I have mentioned above, academic knowledge is not enough for a student to survive in society. On the ground that life is a combination of many things rather than knowledge, your theoretical knowledge only constituted an incremental part of it. For instance, if you are an erudite scholar, yet you do not know how to apply what you have studied and known for real-life contexts, in that way your knowledge becomes futile. Furthermore, in many global corporations nowadays, academic professionalism is becoming a peripheral requirement, instead. They require their skeleton staff social skills more than anything else. Since the more they excel in social skills the more tactful and sensible they are within the realm of the working environment. Take the interview for staff recruitment as a testament to my point. If you're a college student with a grade A certificate, yet in schools, you're not equipped with adequate skills to encounter pressure-required contexts, you'll start panicking when you come to an interview. However, if you're a normal college student with a grade B certificate, yet you have a high awareness of the significance of social skills, being adept at these skills, you'd likely have more chances of success. \n In the contemporary era, dignity and moral are what accentuated the intrinsic values of humans rather than knowledge. Due to the dearth of benevolence and compassion in developing society, the need for social skill will soon eclipse the need for academic knowledge. By way of illustration, if you are a successful and affluent person, or a good and exceptional student, though. You do not know to keep your behaviour within the pale, and your soul always lacks compassion and benevolence. These so-called successful people and good students are tantamount to scrap. \n In conclusion, I strongly advocate that schools, singularly traditional ones, it's time they espoused a new mindset about the role of social skills. I never negate the importance of academic knowledge, yet without knowing how to apply this knowledge for real-life context, this precious diamond would become stones. Therefore, schools play a significant role in aiding their students to equip and apply their knowledge.","The topic is about the relevance of traditional subjects being taught in school. Traditional subjects cover classes taught such as reading , writing , math, science , languages, history, etc. These are the topics (subjects ) learned when attending school. Academic performance relates to the grades or level of learning / learning ability of the student. Based on there differences, it is easy to understand why the prompt restatement is incorrect. When considering that the discussion question asks : ""to what extent do you agree or disagree?"", it also appears that the question response is incorrect in both the restatement + opinion and concluding summary paragraphs. The task is never accurately represented in both TA score based paragraphs. \n The student is attempting to focus on vocabulary skills to enhance this score. The problem with this, is that the advanced English words do not really apply to everyday English writing. The student obviously used a dictionary while writing and based his word usage on ""complicated""' word choices, requiring an academic specially to understand what he is saying when simple everyday english would have sufficed and prevented GRA and LR reductions due to incorrect word usage and confusing statements. Had the writer written a simply worded essay within 250-300 words, these mistakes would have been avoided.","The essay addresses an important issue regarding the education system's focus on academic performance over real-life skills. However, the interpretation of the topic doesn't fully align with the intended discussion about the value of traditional subjects taught in schools, such as reading, writing, math, science, languages, and history. The essay seems to diverge into discussing the balance between academic knowledge and social skills, rather than evaluating the relevance of these traditional subjects. A more direct approach to the question at hand, focusing on the pros and cons of traditional subjects and how they prepare students for the future, would be beneficial.

One of the essay's strengths is the attempt to use a rich vocabulary to express ideas. However, this approach has led to complex word choices that may not be necessary and can make the essay difficult to understand. Simpler language could convey the message more clearly and would likely make the essay more impactful. Remember, clarity and ease of understanding are often more valuable than the use of advanced vocabulary.

In terms of structure and clarity, the essay presents a viewpoint but could improve in how arguments are developed. The points made about the importance of social skills in addition to academic knowledge are valuable, but the essay would benefit from clearer, more direct examples and explanations of how traditional subjects could incorporate these skills.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical and stylistic issues that could be addressed to enhance the essay. It's vital to ensure that sentences flow well and that the point of view remains consistent throughout. Keeping sentences concise and to the point can help maintain the reader's focus on the argument being made.

To strengthen the essay, consider focussing on specific examples of traditional subjects and discussing how they currently prepare students for the future or how they could be adapted to do so more effectively. This approach would directly tackle the essay topic and allow for a more structured argument.

Lastly, the conclusion reiterates the main argument but could be more powerful by summarizing key points more clearly and giving a definitive statement on the extent of agreement or disagreement with the original statement.

Overall, the essay tackles an important issue but would benefit from a clearer focus on the topic, simpler language, and more structured arguments. By addressing these points, the essay can more effectively communicate its message and engage the reader.",3,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,1,Argumentative

The direct question response, as you did in this essay is meant for a different kind of IELTS essay test. The opening paraphrase for this essay should be similar to this: \n <em>It is believed that modern times have changed the way people judge the value of people.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, relevance, and adherence to the essay prompt.

1. **Addressing the Essay Topic**: Ensure your introduction clearly restates the essay topic as per the test's guidelines. This not only shows your understanding of the English language but also sets a clear foundation for your argument. For instance, you could start by noting how modern society often values material wealth over personal virtues, clearly stating your disagreement and reasons for this stance.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some sentences in your essay are confusing or incomplete, making it difficult for readers to follow your argument. For example, stating ""It is pointless that a high-ranked, rich person is dishonest and untrustworthy"" lacks a verb that connects the subject to the point you're trying to make. Focus on constructing sentences that have a clear subject, verb, and object, ensuring your ideas are communicated effectively.

3. **Language and Style**: Pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and grammatical structures. Avoid unnecessary spaces before commas and periods, and ensure you use conjunctions appropriately to avoid run-on sentences. When discussing examples or ideas, ensure there's a clear connection to your main argument, helping strengthen the overall coherence of your essay.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you've provided examples to illustrate your points, further detail and explanation could enhance their impact. Consider developing your examples by explaining how they specifically demonstrate the value of personal integrity over material wealth. This will help strengthen your argument and make it more persuasive to the reader.

5. **Conclusion and Summary**: Your conclusion effectively summarizes your main points but could be improved by clearly restating why personal qualities are more valuable than material wealth or status. Emphasize the importance of integrity, kindness, and trustworthiness as enduring values that should be cherished.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve the clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness of your essay.

People can get more experience through the gap year. If go traveling, they can learn different culture of other countries. Plus, it is the best way to broaden their international view. In other hand, if working, people are able to accommodate the society before they become freshman. Therefore, turning more mature than their future classmate. Moreover, it will be easier to manage their relationship between others. \n Though taking a gap year may help a lot during university in future, it will accompanied by some potential risks or dangerous. Unlike western countries, some parents in Asia concern about their kids exaggerate. They will be anxiety when their kids are not together with them. Furthermore, for children, it is hard to adapt a new environment in both travel or work. While, if working, they might under pressure that making lots complaining.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.</em> \n Here is the thing. If this is indeed the prompt that you are responding to, then it should not have been discussed as a personal opinion essay because the prompt does not require that. It does require an advantage and disadvantage discussion, but only within the realm of public, not personal opinion. Therefore, your approach to the essay may be considered faulty and you will get scored down in the TA section. However, you will be scored properly for the rest of the sections because the essay you wrote still responds accurately to the prompt. It's just that this is not a personal opinion essay so your TA base score would be somewhere between a 4 and 5.","The essay addresses the topic of whether young people should work or travel during a gap year after high school, focusing on both advantages and disadvantages. This aligns with the prompt; however, the essay presents the discussion as a personal viewpoint rather than a broader analysis. The task requires examining the pros and cons in a general context rather than from a personal perspective. This approach may affect the evaluation, as the expectation is more on a balanced discussion rather than a personal opinion piece.

In terms of content, the essay delineates both benefits and drawbacks of taking a gap year, which is commendable. To further improve, consider offering more specific examples and evidence to support these claims. For instance, you mention that traveling can broaden one's international view, but providing concrete examples of how this exposure impacts a person's life or career would strengthen the argument. Similarly, when discussing the challenges, such as adaptation to new environments, incorporating personal anecdotes or broader statistical information could provide a more compelling narrative.

From a grammatical and stylistic standpoint, there are some areas needing attention:
1. Ensure verb tense consistency throughout your essay. Mixing present and past tenses without clear reason can confuse readers.
2. Pay attention to article usage (""a,"" ""the"") and plural forms. For example, ""In other hand"" should be corrected to ""On the other hand,"" and ""people hesitating whether do this"" can be revised to ""people hesitate whether to do this or not.""
3. There are several run-on sentences and phrases missing connectors, which disrupt the essay’s flow. Breaking longer sentences into shorter, clear ones can improve readability.
4. Instead of using vague terms like ""a lot"" or ""something,"" quantify your arguments or describe them in detail for greater impact.

Finally, the essay's conclusion underscores the value of unique experiences gained during a gap year, yet a stronger closing could reiterate the main points of both sides of the argument to ensure a balanced view is presented.

While some people think that the sole purpose of learning a second language is to find a job or for a holiday abroad, others believe there are several more reasons for a person to do so. From my perspective, I relatively favour the latter for some reasons below. \n On the one hand, the requisite of numerous companies nowadays usually includes the ability of using at least one other language. In fact, globalization has clearly been popular recently ; therefore, the need for bilingual employees has as well grown. For instance, an IELTS certification seems to do wonders for employees to earn a job in foreign businesses or countries. The case is also somewhat true when it comes to travel, as it is quite a waste of money to travel to a place without knowing hardly anything about it. \n On the other hand, learning another language satisfies not only our physical needs, but also our moral needs. It is seems to be much more simple for us to communicate and make friends with a person if we are talking in the same language. Furthermore, when learning a new language, we can simultaneously know more about the culture and custom of the nation using that language. Hence, acquiring an extra language can rise our possibility to have more international friends as well as broaden our horizons. \n In short, it is, to a certain extent, true that many people strive to be a bilingual just to apply for a job or travel abroad; however, I think that it has not ever been and should not be limited in that border.","The prompt restatement is acceptable although the first sentence is a bit out of place as it does not refer to required information coming from the original prompt. That is the writer's personal opinion and should actually not be present at all. The proper restatement should only have 3 sentences in it based on the original presentation. The rephrasing should always have the same number of sentences as the original since the information source does not change. Additionally, the personal opinion of the writer should not be vague in the personal opinion presentation. Deliver a clear response to the question. Since the writer already said he agrees with one side, the next scoring expectation is that he will indicate his single preliminary reason to complete the opinion + thesis statement. \n The presentation does not use the required General Reason Explanation + Personal Opinion format for the response. The lack of the proper response formatting created a personal opinion essay rather than a comparative public + personal opinion presentation. Since the writer knows what the public opinion is and why he supports or does not support it, then he should have done so in the same paragraph. Or, he should have presented his personal opinion as a 3rd stand alone paragraph. This essay will receive scores, but it will not be full scoring considerations due to the improper response formatting.","The essay engages with the topic of the importance and effects of becoming bilingual or multilingual, which is a positive start. However, there are several areas where improvement could significantly enhance the effectiveness and coherence of the writing.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The initial sentence introduces a broad statement regarding the increased demand for bilingual or multilingual individuals, which somewhat deviates from directly addressing the question posed. It's crucial to directly restate and respond to the essay question in the introduction to clearly set the stage for your argument. Aim to succinctly summarize the public opinions and your stance within the introduction, using a similar structure to the prompt for clarity.

2. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
While you do state a personal opinion, the presentation could be more direct. After mentioning your agreement with one viewpoint, it would strengthen your thesis to clearly outline your primary reason for this agreement in the introduction. This would provide a clear roadmap for your essay and help readers understand your position from the outset.

3. **Essay Structure and Argumentation:**
The essay would benefit from a more structured response format. Instead of merging general opinions with personal viewpoints throughout, consider separating them into distinct sections. One approach could be to dedicate one paragraph to public opinions and another to your personal stance, each supported by clear, specific reasons. Alternatively, you could integrate your personal opinion as a standalone third paragraph, ensuring each viewpoint is explored fully and distinctly. This structure would help balance the presentation of external opinions with your insights, leading to a more comparative and analytic essay.

4. **Writing Mechanics:**
There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could be refined. For instance, be mindful of punctuation placements, such as the space before semicolons and consistency in using American or British English spelling conventions. Additionally, phrases like ""it is seems to be"" contain a redundancy that could be simplified to ""it seems to be.""

5. **Supporting Arguments:**
The essay includes some descriptive arguments that bolster your position, such as the importance of bilingualism for employment in a globalized world and the broader cultural and social benefits of learning a new language. Enhancing these points with more detailed examples or evidence would provide stronger support for your arguments. Moreover, directly addressing counterarguments or common misconceptions could further enrich your essay’s persuasiveness.

By focusing on these areas for improvement—clearly stating your thesis, structuring your essay according to the prompt's expectations, refining the writing mechanics, and providing more detailed supporting evidence—you'll be able to craft a more compelling and coherent response.

Freedom without discipline is impossible. Humans want to have liberty because of these following reasons. The first reason is self-determination in our life which means we can make decisions to choose things without dependence on guardians. Besides, we have opportunities to have new experiences which a stable life can not respond well to. For example, when we choose an unsustainable life, we have to go to different places where we can not only travel but also work. The following reason is having challenges for ourselves and improving coping with problems. However, the answer of limitations on freedom is difficult. As a result we must have responsibility, rules to maintain our free lifestyle without being bad for society. Moreover, freedom means making choices and maintaining balance between our individual demands between the general public.","The essay is more focused on why people want freedom as opposed to defining what freedom is. The question asks you to define freedom, rather than the reasons people desire freedom. While parts of the essay at the beginning and end touch on this discussion, the middle part, where the discussion matters the most, does not do that. It veered away from the focus and as such, created a diversion in the writing process. That will force the score of this essay to be lower than expected. Remember that you have to stay on track with the discussion instruction to gain a better score. That means, focusing on defining freedom rather than what freedom signifies to people.","The essay presents an interesting perspective on freedom, emphasizing the importance of discipline and responsibility alongside it. It suggests that freedom is not just the ability to do whatever one wants but involves making good, true, noble, or right choices. This is a solid start as it attempts to define freedom in a philosophical way. However, the essay shifts focus to why people desire freedom, discussing self-determination and the opportunity for new experiences, which moves away from the initial task. The assignment asks for a definition of freedom, not an exploration of why people want it. Keep the focus sharply on defining what freedom is throughout the essay to meet the requirements more closely.

Regarding language and structure, there are a few areas that could be improved:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some sentences are a bit long and could be simplified for better understanding. Breaking down complex ideas into simpler, shorter sentences can help make the essay more clear and readable.

2. **Spelling and Grammar**: Overall, the spelling is good, but there are minor grammatical issues that could be smoothed out for better flow and clarity, like the use of commas and conjunctions to connect ideas more clearly.

3. **Descriptive Arguments**: While the essay does provide some examples and reasons for the value of freedom, these could be more directly tied to the definition of freedom itself. When mentioning self-determination and the search for new experiences, try to clearly link these back to how they help define what freedom means rather than why it's desired.

4. **Purpose and Direction**: Ensure that the point of view is consistently clear throughout the essay. Starting with a strong definition of freedom sets a good foundation, but each paragraph that follows should directly support and expound on that definition. Avoid diverging into related but off-topic discussions.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion does well to summarize the arguments made but could be strengthened by directly restating the definition of freedom as discussed in the essay. This reinforces the main point and leaves a strong, lasting impression.

In terms of content, it would be beneficial to concentrate more on elaborating a comprehensive, singular definition of freedom as the essay begins to do, rather than exploring various reasons individuals may seek freedom. While these reasons can illustrate points about what freedom is, the core of the essay should remain focused on defining freedom itself based on the assignment's instructions.

Overall, the essay presents valuable ideas but needs to maintain a tighter focus on the task at hand. By adjusting the structure, clarifying the language, and sticking closely to defining freedom, the quality and coherence of the essay can be significantly improved.",4,4,3,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Argumentative

With regard to individuals, they are likely to be swayed by the irresistible images and practical use of unnecessary items, leading to overbuying. For instance, being exposed to digital pieces advertisements, people are lured into impulsive shopping that they may not use afterward. In addition, no sooner might companies or businesses exaggerate or even distort the facts related to their products for commercial purposes than the customers can experience feelings of confusion about these items, making them have troubles selecting the products to their taste. \n In contrast, it seems that the shortcomings of this phenomenon overshadowed by the benefits.

In this way, customers' shopping experience would be far more pleasant on the grounds that they can compare prices as well as the quality of the items, thereby buying high-quality and affordable products. Secondly, delicate and well-designed advertisements can enable the messages involved in products and services to reach potential customers, followed by an increase in sales for businesses. Therefore, huge revenues generated through producing and selling activities might help to boost the global economy. \n Conclusively, despite a few plus points of the popularity of advertisements, the good sides far outweigh the bad ones for numerous reasons. It is recommended that by carefully considering the merits and demerits, customers can make informed decisions to purchase items through adverts.","The point of the essay is to prove that your opinion, the one that supports the positive point of view, is the correct opinion. That means, your reasoning paragraphs should not follow the compare and contrast on an individual basis as you have presented. Rather, the proper format for the response is to present what the public believe to be a negative reason to support this point view, then explaining why it is actually a positive point of view. 2 reasons may be used to represent the negative, but actually positive discussion. You cannot defend both sides as you do in this presentation. You will not receive any scoring considerations for the aspect that does not support your opinion. The essay will be scored as an underdeveloped piece of writing when that is the format that is used.","The essay addresses the topic of advertising's rapid expansion, acknowledging both its benefits and drawbacks but ultimately argues that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. This stance is clear, aligning with the essay's objective to showcase the positive aspects of advertising. However, structural and argumentative improvements are necessary to enhance clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay initially presents both sides of the argument but could be strengthened by focusing more on illustrating how perceived negatives are, in fact, positive. To enhance your argument, instead of comparing and contrasting disadvantages and advantages separately, introduce each negative aspect and then directly counter it with how it leads to or reflects a positive outcome. This approach would solidify the essay's aim to demonstrate the superiority of positive aspects over negative ones.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is mostly well-written but occasionally suffers from complex sentence structures that may confuse readers. Simplify language where possible without losing meaning. Watch out for run-on sentences and consider breaking them into smaller, more digestible parts. Phrases such as ""no sooner might companies or businesses exaggerate"" could be simplified to directly state your point. Also, ensure consistency in tense and proper use of articles (""the"", ""a"", ""an"").

3. **Author's Point of View**: The essay's viewpoint is clear; it favors the positive impacts of advertising. To make this argument more convincing, ensure each paragraph supports this view without appearing to give equal weight to the opposite side. This focus will prevent the reader from being confused about your stance.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments could be more compelling by directly addressing counterpoints as a means to strengthen the position taken. For example, when discussing the issue of impulsive shopping due to advertising, immediately follow it with an explanation of how this behavior benefits consumers, such as exposing them to new products that can enhance their lifestyle. Moreover, concrete examples or data could bolster arguments, making your essay more persuasive.

In summary, emphasizing the positive over the negative in a more structured manner, streamlining language for clarity, and enhancing arguments with direct counterpoints and examples will improve the essay significantly. Focus on making your points in a simpler, more direct way to make your essay accessible to all readers while ensuring it is cohesive and strongly supports your viewpoint.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Initially, deforestation underpins the global warming process because the carbon dioxide will not be held by the plants. Secondly, it will accelerate the speed of the water of the rain causing flood and erosion. Finally, the forests are the house of a wide range of various animals and plants in the ecosystem; therefore, cutting down trees endangers the wild species. This problem should be urgently solved firstly by the government and then <del></del>by the citizens. \n One of our group's possible solutions is that the authorities should organise campaigns to raise the residents' awareness by giving speeches about the essence of the jungles and adverse effect of deforestation, but not giving the leaflets which can lead to the littering status. \n Another suggestion is punishment should be carried out: one year of doing public activities per one tree. Although this could be a suitable solution, we have argued that this is not appropriate advice. Our group members have indicated that the illegal foresters will hide and run, additionally, governments don't have enough policemen to supervise the forests and this is an adversity. \n In summary, instead of implementing the disciplines, young generations and also adults should be educated on how critical the forest is, in case it could help in preventing deforestation status and either saving trees.","When the prompt was created, the writer neglected to create an introductory or preliminary paragraph that focused on deforestation. The topic chosen is not clearly explained by the reason. The prompt statement also fails to reflect the questions to be discussed based on clear responses to the outline questions. oThe prompt statement is not effective in reflecting the writer's thoughts. \n For some reason, the writer saw it fit to bring forth the thesis statement as a topic statement in the 1st discussion paragraph. This created an incomplete prompt statement in the actual prompt paragraph. \n The writer is also careless as there is evidence of lack of proofreading in the work. The inclusion of format coding in the paragraph proves this. There is no discussion development in the paragraphs, only listed problems. Less focus on topic presentations and more discussion or explanations are the actual requirements for the presentation. \n There are more explained solutions, creating a lack of balanced discussion. This imbalance highlights the lack of writing planning and outlining prior to the actual essay drafting. In fact, it is the draft version, rather than the edited final version that Was submitted for this review.","This essay attempts to discuss the critical issue of deforestation, its consequences, and potential solutions. However, there are several areas that require improvements to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness in addressing the topic.

1. **Response to the topic:** The essay dives directly into discussing deforestation but misses an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the discussion. A proper introduction is needed to clearly present the topic of deforestation, outline the main points to be discussed, and state the essay's purpose or thesis statement. This would provide readers with a clear understanding of what to expect in the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay contains grammatical and stylistic issues that hinder clarity. For example, the phrase ""every countries and governments"" should be ""every country and government"". Additionally, avoid using ""a great many"" as it's vague—be specific about the consequences. There's also an accidental inclusion of format coding (such as `<del></del>`), indicating a need for careful proofreading. Simplifying sentences and correcting grammatical errors will significantly improve the readability of the essay.

3. **Author's Point of View:** While the essay expresses concern over deforestation and suggests solutions, the author's point of view could be made clearer by explicitly stating their stance on the issue in the introduction. Currently, the essay lists problems related to deforestation and jumps into solutions without a clear thesis statement unifying the author's perspective throughout the piece.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay briefly mentions the consequences of deforestation and suggests some solutions. However, these points are listed rather than thoroughly discussed or explained. It's beneficial to expand on each point by providing more details, examples, or evidence to support the argument. For instance, explain more about how deforestation accelerates global warming or specifically how awareness campaigns could mitigate deforestation. This will make the arguments more persuasive and informative.

Tips for improvement:
- Begin with an introductory paragraph that presents deforestation as the topic, outlines the key points, and includes a thesis statement.
- Proofread the essay to eliminate grammatical errors and unnecessary formatting codes.
- Develop each point by providing more details, examples, or explanations rather than simply listing them.
- Strive for a balance between discussing the problems of deforestation and exploring potential solutions. This includes dedicating more time to planning and outlining before writing.

Enhancing these aspects will result in a more coherent, impactful, and well-developed essay on deforestation, its effects, and ways to address it. Remember, clarity and thorough development of ideas are key to effective essay writing.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Obviously, all circuses are equipped a large number of color lights, outstanding shapes as well as loudly announcement. Especially, lovely animals and clown which attract children's attention, are essential there. When the young in a family want to come circuses, other members usually do together. Therefore, the circuses absolutely gain a primary position in entertainment demand of families. \n At the second place, the circuses are unique places for trained animal performances.

For that reason, circuses are not replaced by any other kind of entertainment. \n At the third place, the entrance tickets of the circus are costly.

Circuses is the plural form. The plural form is not required in this instance because you are being asked to speak of only one circus reference in the essay. The comparison discussion you should have done in this essay to prove your point should have been based on the ""electronics"" argument of the original prompt. Anybody can see a circus or the circus acts online through YouTube. This makes your discussion regarding ticket prices and the ability to see peculiar acts incorrect. It would be cheaper to see a circus act on YT rather than spending to go to the circus to see the acts. Your discussion needs to have focused on the reasons why people would opt to go to the circus, as a form of entertainment, when they can get the same type of entertainment, with no extra charges, via YouTube. .While your discussion is acceptable to a certain degree, the grammar mistakes in relation to the C&C and GRA sections make the essay a bit difficult to read at times.

Please improve your English vocabulary and sentence presentation skills in order to pull up your scores in those scoring sections.","This essay attempts to discuss the significance of the circus as a form of entertainment, presenting several reasons why it remains popular. However, it's essential to address certain aspects to enhance the essay's clarity and effectiveness.

Firstly, the task requires discussing a singular ""circus"" rather than multiple ""circuses."" This focus is crucial as it centers on the unique experience one can have at a circus. The essay, however, uses the plural form, which diverts from the specific instruction. Attention to such details can strengthen the response's relevance to the topic.

Secondly, the essay would benefit from a comparison between attending a circus and watching circus acts online, such as through YouTube. This comparison is vital as it directly engages with contemporary alternatives to traditional circus entertainment. The essay currently overlooks this aspect, leading to missed opportunities for deeper analysis. For instance, discussing why someone might prefer the live experience of a circus, despite the availability of similar entertainment online for free or at a lower cost, would have made for a stronger argument.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay contains several errors that could hinder comprehension. For example, ""circuses is"" should be ""circus is,"" and there are instances of awkward phrasing such as ""loudly announcement."" Simplifying sentence structures and using a grammar checker could significantly improve readability. Further, developing a richer vocabulary and sentence variety could enhance the overall presentation and flow of ideas.

The point of view is relatively clear, with the essay asserting that the circus holds a primary role in entertainment. However, this stance could be strengthened by addressing counterarguments, such as the convenience and cost-effectiveness of digital entertainment options.

The arguments presented are on the right track but require development. For instance, detailing the unique appeal of live animal performances at the circus or explaining how ticket pricing accommodates various social classes are compelling points. Yet, these arguments need more elaboration and evidence to fully convince the reader. Including specific examples or personal anecdotes could make these points more vivid and persuasive.

In conclusion, focusing on the unique aspects of the live circus experience, particularly in comparison to digital alternatives, clarifying grammatical and stylistic elements, and developing arguments with more details and examples, would greatly improve the essay. Remember, a successful essay not only presents a clear and coherent point of view but also engages thoughtfully with potential counterarguments, showcasing a well-rounded understanding of the topic.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay addresses the topic, taking a clear stance on the importance of governmental funding for the arts.

It's important to directly tie your examples and discussions back to the central question of whether governmental funding threatens the integrity of the arts.

Take the time to develop your thoughts more thoroughly and avoid rushing through your ideas. Providing deeper analysis and supported arguments will make your position more convincing.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your essay mentions several important points, such as the role of governmental funding in preserving old traditions and supporting arts that might otherwise be ignored. However, these arguments sometimes lack specific examples or detailed explanations that could strengthen your position. Aim to include at least three sentences per paragraph, with each one offering new information, evidence, or analysis that supports your argument.

While there are some people who strongly believe that individuals are accountable for their health, others claim that it is a government's responsibility to keep city drawers fit. Therefore, some major arguments both for and against this issue will be addressed in the following paragraphs. \n On the one hand, each person has a responsibility to take care of his well-being should be taken into account . Firstly it is commonly believed that everyone's health is difficult and one knows exactly what is beneficial for his body and what is not. Based on the report provided by that individuals have to look up productions, which is beneficial for their health. For instance, people should avoid consuming unhealthy food such as junk food, soft drinks which lead to a higher risk of contracting cardiovascular disease. Moreover everyone should do more exercise and build up their muscles. Apart from that, people must sweep away bad habits such as drinking alcohol, stick to the computer for a long time or stay up late. \n On the other hand, there are two primary points for other people to defend the view that authorities should make sure that citizens are healthy. First and foremost, it is undeniable that governments should allocate more funds to the maintenance of existing fitness facilities as well as the construction of new ones. This is supported by the fact that authorities collaborate with nonprofit organisations to set up chain new sport centres and encourage city dwellers to build up their strength and stamina with reasonable prices which enhance the citizen's sporting spirit. In addition, authorities should prohibit production and selling some items, which are harmful for fitness. The governments should fine people who smoke cigarettes in public heavily and tax some companies, which produce unhealthy commodities, highly. \n In conclusion, from the above explanation, individuals and government share equally duties, to ensure a healthy life and well-being.","The prompt for this essay falls under the 3 paragraph requirement based on the writing instruction ""Discuss both points of view and give your opinion"".

Instead, it presented arguments for both sides without clearly stating a personal stance. It's essential to revisit the prompt to ensure that the essay structure reflects the requirements, which typically include discussing both perspectives adequately and concluding with the author's viewpoint as an additional, definitive stand.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay communicates its points, it suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that could confuse the reader. For instance, the phrase ""each person has a responsibility to take care of his well-being should be taken into account"" is convoluted. A clearer phrasing could be, ""It should be taken into account that each person has a responsibility to take care of their well-being."" Consistency in using either 'people' or 'persons' would also help in maintaining stylistic coherence. Reading the essay out loud or using grammar checking tools may help identify and correct these issues.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay lacks a clear personal perspective, which is necessary according to the instructions. After discussing both viewpoints, it's crucial to explicitly state your personal opinion on whether health responsibility lies more with individuals or the government, supported by reasoned arguments.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: The essay provides examples and reasons in support of each perspective but could benefit from more detailed evidence and analysis. For instance, when mentioning the government's role in promoting health, specifics on how sport centers and regulations impact public health could strengthen the argument. Similarly, for the individual's role, discussing personal success stories or statistical evidence related to lifestyle changes could add depth to the argument.

To improve, focus on restructuring the essay to include a distinct personal opinion, enhance clarity and coherence through careful revision of sentences, and enrich the arguments with more specific examples and evidence.

In my opinion, I complete agree that ex-prisoners' experiences are the best material to educate teenagers. \n It is more persuasive than other teaching methods to preach the harm of crime. People who are rehabilitated after prison sentence can teach teenager what kinds of consequences they have after committing a crime, such as losing several years of freedom and having difficulties to find a job in the future, especially for the children who consider about criminals leading glamorous lives. In addition, it provides a distinctive prospective to reconsider the crime, which is rare for normal teachers or parents.

For example, school teachers usually teach the children by textbook and lack of objective feelings after breaking the law. \n On the other hand, it helps reformed criminals achieve self-value.

With something to do after prison sentence, ex-offenders are less likely to break the law again.

The main argument is clear and aligns well with the essay topic. However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to elevate its overall effectiveness and clarity.

Firstly, addressing the initial concern: the essay is responsive to the given topic, advocating for the value of ex-criminals as educators to prevent youth crime through their unique experiences. This stance is consistent throughout the essay, demonstrating a clear point of view.

However, there are spelling and grammar issues that need attention to improve readability and professionalism. For instance, ""complete agree"" should be ""completely agree,"" ""crim"" should be ""crime,"" ""persuasive"" could be more accurately written as ""more persuasive,"" and ""teenager"" should be ""teenagers."" Additionally, ""prospective"" seems to be a mistaken word usage and likely should be ""perspective."" Careful proofreading and use of grammar-checking tools can help identify and correct these types of errors.

In terms of stylistic elements, the transition between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother. Specifically, the transition phrase ""On the other hand"" in the third paragraph suggests a shift to an opposing viewpoint, which is not the case. A more appropriate phrase such as ""Aside from the reasons above"" would continue the support for the initial argument without indicating a contradiction. This adjustment would maintain the focus and add strength to the essay's structure.

The essay would also benefit from a more developed introduction and conclusion. Adding one or two more sentences in these sections to summarize or paraphrase the discussion could provide a stronger framework for the essay. This expansion would not only clarify the thesis and main points for the reader but also contribute to a higher evaluation of the essay.

While the argument is supported with examples and reasoning, incorporating more detailed descriptions and possibly real-life success stories of ex-criminals positively influencing teenagers could enrich the argument. Demonstrating concrete outcomes of such educational approaches would offer a compelling case for the essay's stance.

Overall, this essay raises a compelling point about the value of leveraging the experiences of ex-criminals in youth education.

Almost all aspects relating to this field are accordingly always a fiery debated topic among people from every walk of life, one of which is the teacher's giving school-goers much homework.

Using simpler and more direct language could help in conveying ideas more clearly and effectively. It's crucial to ensure that sentences are coherently structured and that the words used accurately convey the intended meaning.

Directly addressing the prompt from the outset will provide a clearer direction and stronger argument.

Another crucial aspect is the need for balanced, well-structured arguments. The introduction of the essay could be made more straightforward by clearly stating your position on the topic. Furthermore, the conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points discussed, reinforcing your stance while offering a comprehensive closing thought.

3. Clearly state your viewpoint early in the essay to give the reader a clear understanding of your stance.
4. Structure your essay to make your arguments more evident. Present one idea at a time, and use paragraphs to separate different points.
5. Support your arguments with specific examples or explanations to make them more compelling.

While I agree that in some countries where citizens face poverty or adversity in healthcare and education, the money should be reserved for these services, the countries with secured economic situation should, however, invest in the art projects and gain benefits from the policy. \n It is more practical for less developed countries to invest in the servies that are most needed. Not all countries in the world can provide their citizens with enough basic necessities in life. Some of which are even suffering from wars and severe life conditions. Therefore, the governments should adopt a more pragmatic resource allocation scheme by giving out food, shelter and education opportunities to their people. By doing this, they can make sure their citizens at least survive and live somehow comfortable lives before they can reach other bigger goals in life. If the government overlook their real difficult situations and keep investing in art, this would leave the burden on the citizens' shoulders rather than help them. \n However, some countries with more developed economy which can secure life of all their citizens should consider allocating its budget in arts. Arts in general can promote physical and mental well-beings of individuals and this can only be achieved after physiological needs are fulfilled, which means people are not starved and fully sheltered . A good piece of music or a vivid painting can usually uplift people's moods and tend to boost workers's productivity and serves as a means to unwind better than any other alternatives. Therefore, the money granted to art projects, would no doubt do wonders on citizens' overall well-being, which in turn benefits the society as a whole. \n In conclusion, it depends on the stability and security of wealth in each nation that they should make investment in arts a priority. \n (Linh, 317 words)","This is a single opinion essay. You cannot use a comparative discussion format for this. You are to fully support a strong stance given the discussion topic. In order to support the statement, you first need to indicate how strongly you feel about the topic. You cannot simply agree or disagree. You need a sense of heavy emotion to complete the response. Additionally, you should not have started your actual discussion in the prompt paraphrase. You should have reserved it Had I written the prompt paraphrase for this essay, I would have said: \n <em>Most governments have a policy of supporting the arts. However, certain sectors of society do not support this move. They believe that the financial allowance for the arts should be re-allocated for more important projects. My personal observations regarding this discussion topic has led me to strongly disagree with the latter belief. I believe that the allowance for the arts should not be distributed to other projects.</em> \n Now, once you have made your support for a particular side clear, the examiner will expect you to justify your position using 2 valid positions in the reasoning paragraphs. One reason per paragraph. You must never do a comparative essay and have a divided point of view unless you are discussing a A/D essay topic. Anything other than that topic in particular, you must always present a solid support for only one side. \n The reason behind this is simple, by focusing your discussion on only 1 stand to defend, you will have the full opportunity to score well in the coherence and cohesiveness section of the essay, which is the next highest scoring consideration in the grading rubic. When you divide the discussion points into pro and con, you do not create a cohesive and coherent presentation. It alters the instruction from the singular stance discussion to a divided stance presentation. That runs against the original instruction for the discussion as provided.","Your essay provides an interesting perspective on government spending on the arts. However, there are several areas in which it could be improved to better meet the requirements of the task and enhance clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay tries to discuss both sides of whether governments should invest in the arts. However, the essay task requires a single, clear stance on the topic. Instead of exploring both viewpoints, you should choose one position and support it strongly throughout your essay. Expressing your viewpoint with more intensity and emotion will make your argument more compelling.

2. **Introduction Improvement:** The introduction should clearly state your position without beginning the argument. Rather than immediately discussing the importance of art, you might start by acknowledging the debate about government spending on the arts and then state your own view more emphatically. This sets the right tone and focus for the rest of your essay.

3. **Structure and Argumentation:** Your essay should focus on providing a cohesive and logical argument supporting your stance. By choosing one side to argue for, you can dedicate each body paragraph to a specific reason supporting your view. Avoid discussing the opposite side unless it's to refute it with further support for your position. This focused approach will help in achieving better coherence and cohesion in your writing.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** While your essay has minor spelling or grammatical errors, paying closer attention to subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and consistent tense usage will improve clarity. Moreover, simplifying complex sentences can make your arguments more accessible.

5. **Clarity of Point of View:** Ensure that your point of view is unmistakable throughout the essay. Opening with a strong thesis statement in your introduction and reinforcing this stance consistently in your body paragraphs and conclusion will make your essay more persuasive.

6. **Descriptive Arguments:** Your arguments are good but could be more impactful with specific examples or evidence. When discussing the benefits of investing in the arts, incorporating real-world examples or citing studies could strengthen your position.

By focusing on a single perspective and providing a more structured argument, your essay will be more in line with the task requirements. Additionally, polishing grammar and style will further enhance the readability and effectiveness of your writing. Keep practicing, and remember to focus on creating a clear, cohesive argument.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4539,https://essayforum.com/writing/universities-apply-business-like-skills-79948/,dev,Should universities apply business-like skills instead of providing theoretical knowledge?,"As there are so much changes in the qualifications and criteria needed in the workforce, many people are concerned about whether universities should apply business-like skills instead of providing theoretical knowledge in their curriculums. I firmly believe that it would be better off if universities provide their graduates with practical knowledge in the workplace. \n Firstly, it is obvious that the main reason high-school graduates going to university is to obtain specific knowledge and skills, which will enable them to acquire a promissing occupation. In fact, most enterprises when recruiting personel usually demand a certain experience on their candidates. This request might at some point be difficult for fresh-graduates to comply if they did not get exposured to the real working situations when in university. Therefore, by providing practical knowledge,universities are facilitating their students to cultivate their well-rounded mind and become more mature and thus acquire better job prospect in the future. \n Secondly, the curriculums in some universities are becoming old-designed and may be inappropriate as there are many alternative approaches. Students spending three of four years attending those classes may be a waste of their time, energy and money. If a university ultilize new modern teaching programmes, not only will its graduates be more competitive in the job market, but the university can itself keep pace with the technological developments and move forward. \n That is not to say university should neglect the pure scientific research. There are many students interested in theoretical subjects such as maths and philosophy, who choose to become scientists or scholars. Unfortunately, those people are few. \n In conclusion, i would argue that the advantages of universities applying functional skills and practical knowledge in their teaching programmes do outweigh the disadvantages.","Dear student, in addition to what Tran pointed out above, I would like to offer you a reminder when writing a direct response essay. You are never to address anything in the discussion except the opinion that you agree with. That is the standard discussion requirements of a Task 2 essay unless otherwise specified. Since you included an under developed opposing discussion, you turned the direct response into a compare and contrast discussion, which will have a direct effect on your final TA score. \n It is also better to not count off the statements in your paragraph. This shows that you are not really confident of your discussions and you are trying to buy time in order to think of what to write. Instead of counting off, you should practice using transition sentences at the end of each paragraph. The transitions sentence should serve to introduce the next topic you will be discussing in the following paragraph. So the topic sentence sets up the discussion and introduction of the topic sentence which is located at the start of every paragraph.","Your essay provides a well-structured argument on why universities should focus more on practical knowledge than theoretical knowledge in their curriculums. However, there are areas where improvements can greatly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your essay. Let's explore these areas:

1- **Response to the Topic**: Your essay addresses the core topic effectively, arguing strongly for the inclusion of practical skills in university curriculums. Ensure all your points directly support your stance without deviating into contrasting discussions unless the essay prompt specifically asks for a comparison. Concentrating on the position you agree with strengthens your argument and maintains focus throughout your essay.

2- **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several grammatical issues and spelling mistakes (e.g., ""concider,"" ""promissing,"" ""personel,"" ""exposured,"" ""ultilize"") that can distract readers from your message. Consider using spell-check tools and review grammar rules to enhance the readability of your essay. Stylistically, aim for more variety in your sentence structures and a formal tone, avoiding contractions and colloquial expressions.

3- **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is clear and maintained consistently throughout the essay. To further strengthen this, each paragraph should seamlessly flow into the next. Instead of numerically listing reasons or arguments (""Firstly,"" ""Secondly""), use transitional sentences that gracefully link each idea to the next, showing their relation and building a coherent narrative.

4- **Arguments and Descriptions**: Your arguments are relevant and generally support your point of view; however, they could be more descriptive and vivid. For example, providing specific examples of how practical skills have benefitted graduates in the workforce could offer concrete evidence to back your stance. Additionally, ensure all arguments contribute directly to your thesis to avoid the impression of an underdeveloped opposing discussion, which can dilute your essay's focus.

In summary, focus on refining your grammar and spelling, make your transitions smoother, and ensure all arguments directly support your thesis. By addressing these areas, you'll enhance the strength and clarity of your essay, making your argument more compelling and easy to follow. Your essay demonstrates potential, and with these adjustments, it will stand out even more.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Although there are several drawbacks, I believe it has more benefits. \n On the one hand, taking a gap year has plenty of advantages. Going outside instead of staying at home is a good way to improve not only one person's view but also their social skills. Students can have more knowledge and experiences about the place where they go, such as tradition, culture and local language. In addition, it broadens people's mind, lets them know how society works so that they can gain more skills at work. Travelling also is an opportunity for students who want to release stress after formal exams. In my personal view, most postgraduate people, after overcoming their high school, find a way to enjoy the joy that they could not do by the time they prepare for tests, and most people consider travel a good choice for them. \n On the other hand, there are many dangers in having a break. The main issue is that students who do not have enough experience and personal skills may be cheated or at risk. For instance, some people can fool money by stealing their wallet if they do not pay attention. The other problem is that a number of people spend too much time on vacation. They forget to concentrate on their knowledge. so that when students attend university, it takes several times to become acquainted with the studying environment. \n In conclusion, whatever people choose to take a gap year or study, it always has benefits and disadvantages. Youth only has one and we can not own it again so that each teenager should deserve it and decide what is the most important.","<quotation>their leisure time before beginning college</quotation> \n This is an extremely vague reference. It does not clearly restate the gap year for the reader. This infers any time that a student does not want to attend college yet. That is not the same as a gap year.

The reference you used may lead to a GRA deduction due to confusion. \n <quotation>On the other hand, there are many dangers in having a break</quotation> \n This will cause a C+C deduction for you. The problem lies in how you are not sticking to defending your personal opinion, which is the requirement for this paper.

That is because you violated the writing rules for a single opinion defense essay.","Your essay explores an interesting topic about the pros and cons of taking a gap year before starting college. You have successfully addressed the essay topic, providing reasons and examples to support your view, which is a great start. Let's go through some points to enhance your essay further, focusing on clarity, argument consistency, point of view, and language use.

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: When you talk about students spending their leisure time before starting college, it's essential to be very clear. The term 'leisure time' is too vague in this context. To improve clarity, specify that you are discussing the period when students intentionally decide to take a break from academic pursuits. Phrases like ""taking a gap year"" or ""postponing college attendance"" make your meaning clearer. This specificity will help avoid any confusion and make your argument stronger.

2. **Consistency in Argument**: Your essay starts with a positive view on taking a gap year, highlighting its benefits. However, introducing a paragraph on the dangers of taking a break somewhat contradicts your initial stance. In an essay where you're expected to defend a single point of view, it's crucial to stick to that viewpoint throughout. Instead of presenting counterarguments directly, you could acknowledge potential drawbacks but then explain how these can be mitigated or are outweighed by the benefits. This approach maintains your defense of the initial opinion and keeps your argument coherent.

3. **Point of View**: You have made your point of view clear by stating you believe the benefits of a gap year outweigh its disadvantages. This is good practice. Remember to keep your essay focused around this viewpoint, reinforcing it with each argument you present.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: Your essay includes a variety of arguments in favor of taking a gap year, such as improvement in social skills, gaining knowledge, and stress relief. These are compelling points. To strengthen your essay further, consider providing more detailed examples or personal experiences that demonstrate these benefits. This will make your arguments more vivid and engaging.

5. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**: There are minor grammatical errors and areas where sentence structure could be improved for clarity. Look out for run-on sentences or places where punctuation may enhance readability. Additionally, avoid switching between singular and plural forms without clear reason, as it can confuse readers. Simple language and short sentences can also make your essay easier to follow.

6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion does well to summarize your stance. To make it more impactful, consider restating the most compelling reason for your opinion briefly. This leaves the reader with a strong, clear impression of your view.

In summary, your essay presents a thoughtful examination of the gap year decision. By clarifying your terminology, maintaining a consistent viewpoint, enhancing your supporting arguments with specifics, and addressing some stylistic issues, you can make your essay even more persuasive and coherent.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

IELTS Writing Task 2","Response: \n It is thought by some that the funds are being exhausted un-necessarily, on the arts, by the government and that this amount can be utilized in a much better way in other avenues. In my opinion, although it's important to promote the arts and, therefore, investing in it is definitely required, excessive spending on arts is counter-effective and that this amount can be better used in other areas. \n On the one hand, it's imperative for the government to promote the arts and make sure that it has sufficient funds available to do so. Promoting arts and investing in it serves a number of purposes. Firstly, art is considered to be a matter of national pride and one's self-esteem and, it is closely linked to a nation's cultural heritage; investing in art, therefore, can give a boost to a nation's image. Secondly, a lot of creativity and imagination is required to develop the art. These are the important parameters that enhance the skills of an individual and may have a lasting effect. Lastly, investment made in the arts may result in the source of revenue for a nation which can be used for nation building and other development activities. A nation with rich cultural heritage and strong foundation in art can be attractive to the tourists from all over the world. \n On the other hand, the funds exhausted in developing and promoting the arts, can be better utilized on other areas that may have a direct and lasting impact on a nation's well-being. For example, the money can be spent on developing the infrastructure and technology, promoting the educational programs, building the cost-effective healthcare program, etc. This would ensure the nation's progress and people will be able to live more fulfilled and satisfactory lives. \n In conclusion, although it is really important to put enough emphasis on the promotion of the arts, thereby investing in it appropriately, a significantly larger proportion of the fund must be made available to those areas that will have a direct impact on a nation's progress, people's well-being, and their standard of life. It does not make a lot of sense to keep investing in arts when people don't have an access to basic infrastructure and facilities.","Dear student, while this is an opinion paper essay, the type of opinion you must discuss is clearly indicated in the prompt instructions. Your line of reasoning must be along the lines of either an agreement or disagreement with the opinion indicated in the original statement. The paraphrasing prompt that you developed for your response essay doesn't follow the original instructions. You do not indicate an agreement or disagreement with the given statement as indicated by the instruction sentence at the end of the original prompt. Therefore, you are not discussing the essay in the manner required and this essay will be considered to be either unresponsive to the prompt requirements or barely discussing a topic related to the task.

Dividing the long sentences would have at least created the 3 sentence minimum requirement for the essay. However, since you did not discuss the correct topic, that is moot and academic at this point.","The essay presented makes a considerable attempt to examine the allocation of government funds to the arts versus other sectors. However, there are several areas that need improvement to fully meet the requirements of the task and enhance the overall effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Alignment with the Topic:** First and foremost, it is essential to directly address the essay prompt. The prompt seeks a clear stance on whether the government's funding towards the arts is justified or if it should be reallocated to other sectors. Although the essay attempts to discuss the importance of both, it does not definitively state an agreement or disagreement with the initial statement presented in the prompt. To improve, ensure that the introduction explicitly indicates whether you agree or disagree with the given statement, followed by arguments that align with this stance throughout the essay.

2. **Sentence Structure:** The opening statement of the essay is overly long and could benefit from being divided into multiple sentences. This not only aids in clarity but also meets the structural requirements of an essay. Aim for concise and clear sentences that convey your point without ambiguity. Breaking down complex ideas into shorter sentences can also help in organizing the essay more effectively.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:** Overall, there are few grammatical or spelling errors. However, paying close attention to sentence structure and punctuation can further enhance the readability and professionalism of the essay. Consider revisiting sections with longer sentences to ensure they are clear and correctly punctuated.

4. **Argument Clarity and Support:** The essay presents arguments for both supporting the arts and reallocating funds to other essential sectors. However, for a more compelling essay, reinforce each argument with specific examples, data, or a more detailed examination of the impacts. It is also crucial to maintain a clear position throughout the essay to avoid confusing the reader. For instance, if arguing for the reallocation of funds, provide concrete examples of areas in dire need and explain how reallocating funds from the arts could make a significant difference.

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion reiterates the importance of both the arts and other sectors, yet it lacks a decisive stance on the initial prompt. Improve the conclusion by clearly stating your position and summarizing the key points that support this view. The conclusion should leave the reader with a clear understanding of your perspective and the reasoning behind it.

But nowadays, more and more people are in a quandary whether or not standardize scores as an optimum measurement of knowledge. These are two major reasons that illustrate scoring is not an effective way to measure student performance. \n To begin with, scores do not present equality among students. For example, those who have a difficulty with a stress environment might struggle when they have a test and the result in skipping multiple questions that they might easily choose the correct answers. Consequently, they get a C instead of deserving an A on the exam. On the other hand, their friends who only draw the answer spontaneously with 25% correct answer probability receive an A because of luck rather than their own ability. Therefore, measurement one's performance by scores is an inaccurate method. \n Secondly, overly concern about grades also generates negative effects on both young people and their educator. Some students desiring to achieve high scores without focusing during class and studying hard tend to use bad alternative ways such as cheating or copying their next neighbors. Not only affect the student, chasing to grades also harms teacher true mission. A travesty of education is that several instructors measure their student's ability not by the knowledge they master but the amount of money in their parent's pocket. The more bribes they receive, the more scores are increased. \n While we weigh the drawbacks of scoring in the educational atmosphere, it is safe to say that this method is not the beneficial way to present one's knowledge. Not only reflect the inequality, grades also create many grievous problems for both the trainer and the trainee. In my individual opinion, schools can evaluate student's ability by different projects or assignments.","Dear student, is this essay for a practice lesson in English or is it for an IELTS test? You should have provided the complete prompt for the discussion so that a proper review of your work could be completed. As of now, only a partial review can be made due to lack of review guiding factors. For starters, the word ""But"" is a connecting word. Therefore, in an academic essay, it is not used to start a proper sentence. Rather, it should be used to connect 2 related ideas in one sentence. So when you use the word ""but"", do not use a period. That is more properly used with a well placed comma in a sentence to show a continuity of though. Avoid constantly using the word though as it could get out hand and turn a long sentence into a run-on sentence, creating points deductions in the GRA section in the process. The personal opinion should not be included as a one sentence presentation at the end either. Always present that, whether it be in an academic essay or a common written presentation, as a stand alone paragraph that is more properly developed using reasoning and examples to help depict your support for a particular statement.","The essay addresses the topic by discussing why standardized scores may not be an effective way to measure student performance, and this point is made through two main arguments. However, to fully meet the essay prompt's requirements, it would be beneficial to ensure the essay directly responds to the specific question asked, if provided. Including the exact prompt could strengthen the response significantly.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic choices, there are areas that need improvement for clarity and academic appropriateness. For instance, using ""But"" to start a sentence is generally avoided in formal academic writing. It's better used to connect ideas within a sentence, typically with a comma instead of starting a new sentence. This helps in maintaining the flow of ideas without abrupt disruptions. Additionally, watch for the overuse of words like ""though,"" which can make sentences overly complicated and potentially lead to run-on sentences. This can detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of your argument.

The point of view is mostly clear throughout the essay, as you argue against using standardized scores as the sole measure of student performance. However, the final paragraph introduces the author's personal opinion quite suddenly. It's more effective to incorporate personal viewpoints as a well-developed standalone paragraph, supported by reasoning and examples. This not only clarifies your stance but also enriches the essay’s content.

The arguments provided offer a good start in supporting the thesis but can be enhanced for stronger impact. The first argument, regarding equality among students, would benefit from more specific examples or data to back up the claim. The idea that scores do not accurately reflect a student's ability due to various factors, like test anxiety, is intriguing but needs further elaboration. The second argument touches on the negative behaviors stemming from an overemphasis on grades, such as cheating. This point would be more compelling with a deeper examination of why these behaviors are detrimental to the educational process and how they fail to reflect true learning.

Lastly, it's crucial to proofread the essay for grammatical errors and ensure sentence structures are varied yet straightforward. This maintains reader engagement and ensures your ideas are communicated effectively.

In summary, focus on directly addressing the prompt (if provided), refining grammar and style for academic writing, developing arguments with specific examples and reasoning, and fully integrating personal viewpoints into the narrative structure.

Discuss both views and give your opinion \n With the changing technology one would argue that shopping has become easier than before while others would disagree that it's harder, on one hand shopping is easier as we can do it at the comfort of our home, the delivery is at our doorstep and we can even access products from other parts of the world that perhaps are not available at our local shops. on the other hand, one would understand that some people see shopping difficult as there are a lot of options to choose from, you are choosing things blindly and you would have to wait for the item to arrive. Personally, I think shopping is way easier than it used to be, because it save us time, to do things that are more productive or enjoyable. \n Shopping in our era is not easier, because we buy the products with a blind eye as we cannot try them on or feel them. For example, a shirt or a dress at Shein, a well known retail online store would have videos of models wearing the clothes, the measurements of the shirt or dress, but still it does not compare to trying the piece of clothing physically. Secondly, if you required your product right away you will not be able to buy it as fast because you need to be patient with shipping and delivery. Unlike not using technology will allow you to have product the day you buy it. Example, I want the latest iphone for example if I go to the store I will get the iphone on the same day as if I were to order it online I will have to wait some time for it to arrive at my destination. \n However, Shopping is easier because thanks to Globalization I can access any product I want from around the world, while in the olden days I could only get local products. An example of this are plantains, they were not as available or even they were not found in Canada at all. Thanks to online services plantains are always available. Also Shopping can be done at the comfort of your home no need to dress up or eat out and your family members or friends won't feel dragged or tired or annoyed of you shopping. If you are a difficult buyer for example, some people have to try everything in the store, undress and dressing takes time of your life and not everyone is on the wavelength as you when it comes to shopping.

Typically, a clear introduction that outlines your understanding of the topic, followed by discussion paragraphs, each presenting a distinct viewpoint before concluding with your personal stance, is expected. This structure helps in organizing your thoughts and presenting them clearly to the reader.

Firstly, there's a need to work on structuring the essay more effectively. The introduction should briefly present the topic and your thesis statement, avoiding diving into the discussion points immediately. Each paragraph afterward should focus on a single argument to support the contrasting views before stating your own opinion clearly in the conclusion.

Regarding grammar and style, there are a few areas that need attention. For example, consider breaking up long sentences to improve readability and ensuring proper punctuation use, such as capitalizing the first word after a period and using commas where necessary. Additionally, phrases like ""on one hand"" and ""on the other hand"" should be followed by commas.

The point of view is somewhat clear but could be enhanced by a more defined structure that distinguishes between discussing opposing views and presenting your personal opinion. This will make your stance more prominent to the reader.

Your essay does provide arguments for both perspectives on how technology affects shopping. To strengthen these arguments, consider including more specific examples, statistics, or personal experiences. Furthermore, when discussing drawbacks such as the inability to try on clothes or the waiting time for delivery, balancing these points with potential solutions or workarounds could make the arguments more comprehensive. 

Key areas for improvement include:
- Adhering to the essay format by clearly defining the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
- Improving sentence structure and punctuation for better clarity and professional presentation.
- Making your point of view more distinct through the essay's structure.
- Enhancing the arguments with more detailed examples or evidence.

It is believed that students ought to wear school costumes in the academic environment. But many others argue that children should be allowed to wear what they want, what makes them feel comfortable. I totally agree that wearing school clothes is a wonderful thing in their childhood and they had better apparel it. \n First of all, uniforms create uniformity among students, a disciplined environment. Each school designs school's costume with its meaning and different feelings of pride. Therefore, when wearing the uniforms, students also comprehend that they always need to make effort to glorify their school's name. Otherwise, putting on a uniform also contributes to the discipline of each student from an early age. That is a significant virtue for very human. \n Furthermore, school clothes built up an equal environment among students. There is no distinction between them when they apparel the same costume. No matter who they are, come from the wealthy family or the casual income one, they are all identical; having the duplicate chance to acquire knowledge, confidently show their abilities. Besides, the white shirt is also a symbol for the student, a childhood with many emotions, experiences at the very first stage of life.

That way the Lexical Resource knowledge of the student can be given an early high assessment in relation to the prompt. \n Now, the discussion asks the writer to consider which policy is the best one, not whether he agrees or disagrees with the policies (to an extent).

While you did agree or disagree, the correct response format was not utilized (which one you believe to be the correct policy and why).

This viewpoint is well-supported through clear arguments that highlight the benefits of wearing school uniforms, such as fostering a sense of pride, discipline, and removing socioeconomic barriers. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to enhance coherence, accuracy, and adherence to the topic prompt.

1. **Adherence to the Topic Prompt**: The essay slightly misses the mark in accurately responding to the specific focus of the discussion, which is ""high school uniforms."" It's crucial to address the topic with the precision it demands, including using the appropriate terms that mirror those in the prompt, such as ""secondary education attire."" Understanding and adhering closely to the prompt is essential for a strong Task Achievement score. 

2. **Use of Specific and Accurate Language**: Introducing varied vocabulary relevant to the topic, such as replacing ""school costume"" with ""secondary education attire"" or ""uniform,"" can demonstrate a broader lexical resource. This not only enriches the essay but also aligns better with the original discussion basis, which can enhance the essay's assessment in relation to the prompt.

3. **Sentence Structure and Cohesion**: While the essay benefits from a clear point of view and supportive reasoning, the sentence structure occasionally hinders its clarity and coherence. Focusing on developing more refined sentence constructions can improve readability and ensure the arguments are presented more persuasively. Utilizing connecting words more effectively will strengthen the essay's flow and cohesion.

4. **Strengthening the Introduction and Conclusion**: Reflecting the prompt more precisely in the introduction sets a focused tone for the essay. The conclusion does a commendable job of summarizing the main points and restating the writer's stance; continue practicing this method but aim for more variety in sentence structure and vocabulary to avoid repetition and elevate the final presentation.

5. **Addressing Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay. Each sentence should be scrutinized for correctness and readability. Stylistically, consider streamlining sentences to convey messages more directly and impactfully.

In summary, the essay shows potential and a good understanding of the topic's significance. By enhancing adherence to the prompt, expanding lexical resource, refining sentence structures, and focusing on clarity and coherence, the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the essay will significantly improve. Practice these aspects to develop writing skills further and achieve higher scores in future essays.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

The body that you developed, which is based on your personal experience is one that would have helped increase the score of your essay, even with the problematic grammar. Examiners tend to score on the higher end when a test taker uses a personal experience for the body of paragraphs because, if it is really related to the prompt demands, as yours is, then this proves that you have a high ability to understand English instructions and also, you have the ability to present a proper defense of a related discussion based on the topic provided. Your whole essay would have gotten an average passing score if you had presented the opening statement as follows: \n <em>There are people who believe that high school students must be part of mandatory volunteer programs. Some of the activities that they recommend are volunteer work at charities, neighborhood improvement, or mentoring to younger children. I am in complete agreement with this line of thinking based on my own personal experience with the said program.<br/><br/>When I was a high school student...</em> \n The above presentation would have tied in directly with your discussion paragraphs and hinted at a high level of English comprehension skills. The concluding statement should have reiterated the prompt, your main reason for approving of it, and then a sentence that repeats your approval of the reasoning.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the topic of whether community service in high school should be voluntary or compulsory, clearly arguing in favor of the latter based on personal experience. This approach, using personal anecdotes, is commendable as it demonstrates an ability to connect personally with the topic, a trait valued in English proficiency tests.

However, the essay begins somewhat abruptly without properly introducing the topic or stating the thesis clearly. A more effective introduction could better prepare the reader for the discussion ahead. For instance, starting with a statement like, ""I firmly believe that high school students should participate in mandatory volunteer programs, such as charity work and neighborhood improvement, based on my enriching experience."" Such an opening would immediately set the stage for the ensuing discussion.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a conclusive paragraph to tie all the points together. A strong conclusion should restate the central argument, summarize the key points discussed, and reaffirm the position taken. It's a missed opportunity to reinforce the argument and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that hinder comprehension and flow. For example, plural-singular agreement errors (""expenditures is not affordable""), incorrect verb tenses (""my dad want me to go""), and awkward phrasing (""base on the experience on my own""). Proofreading and revising for these types of errors would greatly improve the essay's clarity and readability.

Additionally, the essay would benefit from more varied sentence structures to convey points more dynamically and keep the reader engaged. This could involve mixing simple, compound, and complex sentences to add depth to the narrative.

While the personal narrative is engaging and provides a solid basis for arguing in favor of compulsory community service, it's important to streamline the storytelling to maintain focus on supporting the essay's central thesis. Ensuring that each paragraph directly contributes to the argument helps in maintaining a coherent and persuasive essay.

Lastly, simplifying language for clarity and ease of understanding would make the essay more accessible, especially considering the audience of English language learners. Using direct, uncomplicated language can convey ideas more powerfully and effectively.

In summary, focusing on a clearer introduction and conclusion, addressing grammatical and stylistic issues, and refining the narrative to more directly support the thesis will significantly improve the essay. The personal experience shared is a strong foundation; building upon it with these suggestions can make the essay more convincing and compelling.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,3,Argumentative

There are various reasons behind this positive trend. \n The main reason for a profound influence of newspapers on the opinions of people is that these have become an essential part of most of the people's daily life. Every morning many people like to read a newspaper to know about the current affairs and latest news , local, national or international. This keeps them aware of even the social issues prevalent in the society which makes them sentimental and sensitive. Although this is possible through TV and the internet also, but because majority of people are habitual of reading a newspaper daily rather than using TV or the internet as a source of news, this printed media is far more influential. \n In my opinion, this kind of impact of newspaper in forming people's opinions is beneficial. When the newspaper editors print the true news of any issue in the newspaper, the readers can form a right opinion about the people. In other words, the news about scandals or scams can inform the public about the deceptive people who are part of it. There have been many bribery scandals by political leaders and when such incidents are read by the readers in the newspaper, they easily come to know that the leader is corrupt and should not be trusted. \n In conclusion, people's thoughts are affected strongly by the newspapers because they read it daily and this situation is beneficial for them.","Dear student, since this is a direct question essay, you are not supposed to indicate your response as a separate sentence before the discussion. Rather, it should be integrated into the first paragraph discussion that presents a proper restatement of the prompt along with the beginning of your opinion discussion. Now, the main problem with your paper is that you only offer talking points that aim to prove the positive effect of newspaper reading in the formation of the ideas and opinions of people. However, you fail to justify your talking points with supporting reasons and evidence that will support your claims. Thus, your opinion becomes weak and unfounded. Unless you can state popular information and examples to assist in strengthening your opinion, you can't really expect the reader to take your work for it. The response that you provided is simply not convincing enough due to lack of strong supporting popular information and evidence.","The essay addresses the influence of newspapers on people's opinions, which corresponds with the topic. However, the essay could be enhanced by integrating your viewpoint more seamlessly into the introduction. Instead of stating your opinion separately, it would be more effective to weave it into the initial discussion alongside a clearer restatement of the question. This approach helps in presenting a well-rounded introduction.

There are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For example, there are instances of unnecessary commas and a lack of conjunctions that could make the essay flow better. Improving sentence structure and ensuring correct punctuation will enhance clarity and readability. 

Your point of view is stated, suggesting that the impact of newspapers is beneficial in shaping people’s opinions through the dissemination of true news. However, the essay lacks strong arguments and evidence to back up this claim. It is critical to not just state that newspapers have a positive effect but to show how and why this is the case through specific examples and reliable information. For instance, you could include real-life examples of news stories that have had a significant impact on public opinion or cite studies that demonstrate the influence of newspaper readership on social and political awareness.

Moreover, the essay would benefit from exploring a broader range of perspectives. Although it's clear that you view the influence of newspapers positively, considering counterarguments or acknowledging potential downsides before disputing them would strengthen your position and provide a more balanced analysis.

To summarize, ensure that your opinion is integrated at the beginning of the essay, work on grammar and punctuation for better clarity, support your claims with concrete examples and evidence, and consider addressing counterarguments to present a well-rounded discussion. With these improvements, your essay will offer a more persuasive and engaging argument on the role of newspapers in shaping individuals' opinions.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

This causes because of the human attitudes towards damaged stuff also it affects mostly in all the sectors. In this essay, I am going to elucidate the premier reasons of this scenario and certain impacts with relevant instances. \n To commence with the reasons, the foremost fact is the deficiency in quality of products. In general, when the quality of items are compromised accidentally or artificially, the owners suggest that this item will not perform well in future and they select either throw or purchase new one. Secondly, person does not have skills similarly no time to renovate the broken items. Therefore, he is encouraged to eliminate that thing. To exemplify, if someone's mobile phone is damaged and he does not know proper technical solutions, obviously, he include it in trash and search for new one. \n Consequently, a sea change is defined in different fields due to elimination of defective items. Firstly, people dispose crashed products even though those items can be repaired. So that, they do not take interest in recycling methods. Sometimes, those garbage become boon for needy people. For an instance, rich parents give old books of their children to poor children which already acquire more space in their home. Besides, if trashed items throw away from home and other area, the place will become clean but massive dumping yards are increasing nowadays. \n To recapitulate, although defective items are thrown by most of citizens, if such products will be modified by someone, definitely those items might be as useful as before and become best out of waste for long time.",Do not focus solely on the vocabulary aspect of the score.

This is a good choice of topic as it is relevant and allows for a discussion of causes and consequences. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make the arguments clearer and the writing more effective.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay does address the topic by discussing reasons why people throw away items and some of the impacts of this behavior. However, the arguments could be more focused and directly linked back to the thesis statement throughout the essay to strengthen the response.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that make it difficult to understand. For example, 'ancestors were habituated to reform defective items' could be simplified to 'ancestors used to repair defective items'. Simplifying language and focusing on constructing clear and correct sentences will greatly improve readability and coherence. Avoid using complex vocabulary without fully understanding its correct usage, as this can lead to confusion.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** The essay’s point of view is somewhat clear in that it aims to explain why people today prefer throwing things away instead of fixing them. However, this perspective could be made more explicit by directly stating the author's stance on the issue and by using more persuasive language to engage the reader.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** The essay attempts to support its points with examples, but these are often too vague or are not well-explained. For instance, mentioning the disposal of mobile phones could be strengthened by explaining why this exemplifies a broader issue in society. Additionally, providing more specific examples and evidence that directly support the claims made would enhance the essay's persuasiveness.

To improve, focus on:
- Simplifying language while clearly conveying ideas.
- Carefully checking grammar and sentence structure.
- Making the thesis statement and personal stance clearer to the reader.
- Enhancing arguments with specific, well-explained examples.

Therefore many punishments has been invented in order to struggle with it, but it is believed that imprisonment is the best deterrence for criminals. In my opinion, I slightly oppose that because I think not all criminals need going to jail and I'll draw some evidence for my thought. \n From what I have learnt, people have been fighting for their freedom for many years. So the primary reason is when cops imprison them mean they are taking liberty from them, to me this is a very heavy punishment to a living human. Hence, this kind of deterrence should only be applied on those who are actually deserve it such as: gangsters, robbers...With those who just commit a petty offence only need to be deterred slightly. For example, a man behave badly in public place like fighting or talking egregiously about a sensitive topic doesn't need going to jails but can be fined or executed a curfew order in his house for a few days. \n Secondly, if government applies imprisonment on a villains who have committed a serious case, it won't be fair for the victims and may cause fear in the residences when the villains get out of jail. In particularly, a serial killer be sentenced and move to prison will obviously lead to protests or rebellions, unless those have to pay equitably rather than be locked away. \n However, few of them just get in to criminal way because they have to do it for a living. Therefore if there is a chance, we should give to them, being a few years in prison would change them substantially and as a consequence, they become a better person. \n In conclusion, prison is a good and efficient deterrence but it's not the only one. Henceforth before sentencing a specific criminal we should consider if it is petty or inferior to give out the appropriate punishment.","Please provide the prompt for the essay next time so that a clearer review of your essay can be done from a professional standpoint. Right now, I am not really sure what the discussion topic for your essay is because there are several criminal topics that can be discussed based on a similar central subject. The main difficulty with the extent essay is how to explain the degree of your agreement or disagreement with the given prompt. Students tend to always say ""I slightly"" or ""I partially"", thinking that if they take a completely supportive side in the essay, they will be given a lesser score. There are no right or wrong answers in the Task 2 essay. There is only a lower score for not having a clear point of view in the essay. Each time the student chooses the ""I partly"" or ""I slightly"" position in the essay, that indicates an indecision in your thought presentation and opinion. \n The clarity of your thought, the coherence of your reasoning paragraphs, and the cohesiveness of your reasoning presentation can only come from the clarity of a thought process that focuses on a single opinion. The equivalent of ""I slightly"" or ""I partially"" in real world responses would be ""I both agree and disagree"". Which is not one of the choices given in the question instruction. That is why it is more important to show a clear singular point of view rather than a comparative point of view. The extent essay is not a comparative essay. It allows you show a degree of support only within one point of view. \n For example. You could say, ""It is said that... I have to oppose it because...It is important to understand that though there is a belief that... the truth of the matter is..."" The strength of your opinion should be in how it disproves the opposite point of view. By presenting a topic sentence that opposes your point of view, you not only present a clearer explanation of the side that you support, but you are also able to strengthen the extent of your dis/agreement with the given public opinion. \n Do not use special characters such as ellipses in your academic writing. Those are more useful in creative writing instances where it can indicate a suggested thought process. An academic paper, or opinion paper should always use proper and formal punctuation marks.","The essay attempts to discuss the effectiveness of imprisonment as a deterrent to crime, arguing that not all crimes warrant jail time. This theme is relevant, but the response to the topic appears muddled due to a lack of a clear stance. The assertion ""I slightly oppose"" indicates indecision, which weakens the argument. Essays for English proficiency tests benefit from a decisive point of view. Instead of taking a partly supportive stance, it's advisable to firmly agree or disagree with the statement in question, as this demonstrates confidence and clarity in your reasoning.

There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues to address. For instance, ""Crimes has"" should be corrected to ""Crime has,"" and ""many punishments has been invented"" should be ""many punishments have been invented."" Consistent verb tense and subject-verb agreement are crucial for coherent writing. Also, refrain from using informal language and phrases like ""cops"" or ""villains,"" opting instead for their formal counterparts (""police officers,"" ""criminals"").

The essay's point of view is present but not strongly articulated. Phrases such as ""I slightly oppose"" convey uncertainty. A stronger stance, supported by clear and concise arguments, would greatly enhance the essay's persuasiveness. The use of specific examples is good, but these need to be clearly linked to the point being made.

Arguments presented could be more descriptive and structured to better support the author's position. For example, when discussing alternatives to imprisonment, providing evidence or studies that support the effectiveness of these methods would strengthen the argument. The suggestion that not all criminals deserve jail time is a valid one; however, this argument needs to be backed by clearer reasoning and examples.

It's important to avoid using special characters like ellipses (...) in academic writing. These can disrupt the flow and clarity of your argument. Formal punctuation helps maintain the academic tone of your essay.

In summary, the essay presents a potentially interesting perspective on the topic of crime and punishment but suffers from indecision, grammatical errors, and a lack of clear, well-supported arguments. Adopting a definitive stance, improving grammatical accuracy, and providing more detailed examples and evidence would greatly improve the quality of the essay.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

From my point of view, this phenomenon could be both positive and negative. \n On the one hand, the mobile phone is one of the most integral parts of a space-aged environment. One of the most frequently used functions of this device is to announce emergency information, which is essential in infectious disease situations. For example, in the Covid-19 situation, the government of Vietnam now encourages citizens to install NCOVI app on their phone in order to update the news related to the outbreak of Coronavirus. That significantly helps the government to reduce the number of COVID-positive people in Vietnam. Therefore, mobile phones are certainly needed in up-to-date society. \n On the other hand, the widespread use of this device could bring many negative aspects, especially in education. To put it in another way, the easy access to the Internet of this technology leads to the fact that students use this device to cheat in their exams. According to the new national survey of 2000 middle and high school students in the US, more than a third of teens with cell phones (35 per cent) say they have used their phones at least once to cheat during a test and half (52 per cent) say they have used the Internet to cheat. As a result, the negative impact of this device should not be overlooked. \n Given the aforementioned points, it is obvious that the popularity of mobile phones could bring about both benefits and drawbacks to our life. Hence, I would say that this situation is both a positive and negative development.","If the discussion question asks: ""Do you think this is a positive or negative development?"" you cannot say that the topic is both a positive and a negative. The instruction, using the word ""or"" asks you to pick one of the two sides to defend in the essay. Why should this essay be discussed from a singular point of view? The word ""or"" is what made it a singular discussion. The connecting word ""or"" has a specific function within the question. The use of the word indicates "" otherwise"". ""Otherwise"" refers to ""in other or different circumstances"". As you can see, the definition of the word ""or"" creates the opening for a singular opinion discussion. It is not a comparison essay. There cannot be 2 opinions discussed in this essay. All that will tell the reviewer is that there is no set opinion on your end. You did not understand the discussion instructions. It is either you believe it is totally positive or, it is totally negative, there is ""equal"" discussion instruction. That is not what was indicated in the original prompt. Therefore, your essay will be seen as not having a clear opinion, significant point deductions in the TA section, which can result in a below passing score for your essay.","The essay provides a balanced view on the impact of mobile phones in today's society, presenting both the positive aspects, such as their role in distributing emergency information, and the negative effects, especially in the context of education and cheating. While it is good to see an analysis from different perspectives, it's crucial to closely adhere to the essay prompt, which in this case, implies choosing one stance - either positive or negative - rather than discussing both.

One improvement to consider is focusing exclusively on one point of view, as the essay question seems to demand a clear stance. This approach will not only align better with the instructions but also allows for a more in-depth exploration of your chosen perspective. 

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written. However, paying attention to minor errors and ensuring proper use of articles, prepositions, and punctuation can enhance its readability and coherence. For instance, it would be more appropriate to say ""an NCOVI app"" instead of ""NCOVI app"".

The essay author's point of view is presented but lacks a decisive stance due to the attempt to discuss both sides of the argument equally. In future essays, clearly stating your position from the beginning and sustaining it throughout will make your argument more persuasive and coherent.

The arguments provided are relevant and descriptive, effectively highlighting the duality in the use of mobile phones. However, by choosing a singular perspective, as the instructions suggest, you could develop these arguments further to support your specific point of view more convincingly. For instance, if focusing on the negatives, enhancing the argument with more evidence, examples, or statistics related to its impact on education could strengthen your position.

In summary, while your essay demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the topic, focusing on a single stance and refining your grammatical accuracy could significantly improve its effectiveness and adherence to the prompt. Developing your arguments within the framework of a singular point of view will also contribute to a clearer and more compelling narrative.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

The first value is that printed books are essential items for book lovers and enthusiasts to collect, because these type of products have traditional and classic features.

However, there are several key areas that need improvement to better align the essay  with the prompt's requirements and to enhance its overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to address the given topic by considering the transition from print to digital formats. However, the prompt asks for a singular opinion on the extent of agreement or disagreement with a given statement. The essay strays from this directive by presenting a divided stance on newspapers versus books, which complicates the response. It's crucial to focus on presenting a clear, unified opinion. Decide whether you agree or disagree with the statement to a certain extent (e.g., fully, partially) and explain your reasons consistently throughout the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are noticeable issues with capitalization (e.g., ""i"" should be capitalized to ""I""), and some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly constructed. Focus on writing shorter, clearer sentences and ensure proper use of grammar and punctuation. Additionally, maintaining a formal tone by avoiding contractions and ensuring correct spelling would significantly improve the essay's readability and professionalism.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay's point of view is somewhat unclear due to the divided stance on different aspects of the topic. To clarify your position, start by stating your opinion clearly in the introduction, including the extent of your agreement or disagreement. Then, consistently support your opinion throughout the body of the essay, ensuring all arguments relate back to your main stance.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay presents reasons for both sides of the argument, it's essential to focus solely on supporting your chosen stance. Each paragraph should introduce a clear reason for your opinion and provide detailed examples or explanations. Avoid discussing opposing views unless you are refuting them to strengthen your argument. 

Consider shortening the essay to a more concise format, aiming for around 275-290 words. This approach will allow for a clearer presentation of your opinions and arguments. Remember, the goal is to convey your viewpoint as effectively as possible within the guidelines provided by the prompt.

Furthermore, many indoor sporting areas built for the event might be left unused because the next Sea games will be hosted by another country. \n On the other hand, on a global stage, an international event is a great opportunity for a nation to promote its culture, tourism, and so on. This is due to the fact that athletes and interviewers from various countries will be invited and join the event. From this, they will advertise and introduce what they are interested in. Besides, businesses of local citizens living around areas for the event could also boost their revenue as there are more tourists or travelers who want to behold how athletes compete in the stadium. \n In conclusion, international sports events could consume a lot of money, however, it could be compensated by other values such as national finance and the image of the country.","This type of prompt asks the writer to consider 3 things: \n - Why does the public support the opinion? (Supporting explanation) \n - What does he think about the public opinion (personal opinion: Support or non-support) \n - Why does he see the public opinion that way? (Explanation) \n Based on the current writing, I cannot say that the writer actually considered the public vs, his personal opinion. That is because there is a lack of proper 3rd and 1st person pronoun usage in the essay. There needs to be a demarcation between opinions in each paragraph through pronoun usage otherwise, the general opinion presentation could be considered only of the writer's personal point of view. Keep in mind that this is a comparative essay of the public v, personal kind and such, must be reflected that was in each paragraph. \n The reasoning provided is sound and acceptable but, unclear with regards to who is actually thinking and presenting these opinions. Each paragraph needs to represent 2 opinions as previously described.","Your essay addresses the topic of the benefits and drawbacks of hosting international sporting events, which is a good start. Here are some specific aspects to consider for improving your essay:

1. **Clarity of Opinion and Structure**: Your essay attempts to present two sides of the argument – the benefits and the drawbacks of hosting international sports events. However, it's important to clearly separate your personal opinion from the general public opinion. Use phrases like ""In my opinion,"" ""Many people believe,"" or ""Some argue"" to clearly distinguish between these different viewpoints. This will help readers understand which parts of the essay are your personal insights versus a representation of general sentiment.

2. **Pronoun Usage for Clarity**: To make your arguments clearer, consider using pronouns more deliberately. For example, use ""I believe"" to express your view and ""they think"" or ""others argue"" when referring to the opposing viewpoint. This distinction was missing, making it difficult to differentiate between your perspective and the broader public opinion.

3. **Supporting Arguments**: You've provided reasons for both supporting and opposing the hosting of international sports events. It's good that you mentioned aspects like the financial costs and the potential for boosting tourism and local business. However, these ideas would benefit from more detail and examples to strengthen your argument. For example, when discussing the cost, compare it with the potential revenue from tourism to provide a more balanced view.

4. **Grammar and Style**: There are a few spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues in your essay that could be improved. For instance, pay attention to subject-verb agreement (""people in the local area could be earned from the event"" could be rephrased for clarity), and consider breaking long sentences into shorter ones to improve readability. 

5. **Conclusion Enhancement**: Your conclusion mentions the trade-off between the financial cost and the potential benefits. This is a good strategy, but it would be more effective if you clearly restated your position here. Reinforce why you believe the benefits outweigh the costs, based on the arguments you've presented.

By focusing on these areas, you can make your essay clearer, more persuasive, and engaging. Remember, the key is to clearly present your opinion, substantiate it with well-structured arguments, and distinguish your views from general opinions. This will not only improve the clarity of your writing but also make your standpoint more compelling to the reader.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4552,https://essayforum.com/writing/higher-education-young-top-students-benefits-81733/,dev,"Higher education only to young top students? It has benefits, but I prefer equal opportunity","People have different views about whether higher education should only provide for gifted students or extend to people of all ages despite they did not perform well. Personally, I am more convinced that people all have access to education opportunities regardless of their abilities. \n On the one hand, there are some reasons why people think that tertiary education only should be available to young students with good grades. Firstly, a good academic result probably reflects students' ability and determine whether or not they can fit in academic environment at college. If students have not acquired sufficient-knowledge at high school, they are possibly not qualified for higher education. Secondly, selecting outstanding students at a young age allows the governments to concentrate their resources towards the development of high quality workforce. In other words, rather than taking risks in training students of mixed abilities, the states can mobilize resources to create a more favorable learning environment with improved education quality, better research capacity and facilities for a selected group of high-potential individuals. \n On the other hand, I embrace the idea that making universities accessible for everyone regardless of their age and learning capacity. The right to education is a human right, so everyone should be given freedom to enter higher education if they desire without any limitation. The benefits of university education are not influenced by their age, so there is no reason to set age requirements in college admission. Additionally, it is true that high school students take a wide range of classes. For this reason, many students may end up having poor overall results, but in some certain subjects, their marks might be extraordinary high. For example, my friend performed very badly at Natural subjects, such as Math or Physics, making her average score disappointedly low when she left high school. However, she was excellent at English and became top students when entering university. Therefore, students like my friend should be allowed to take advantage of their strengths and join in specialized courses at university. \n To conclude, notwithstanding certain advantages of limiting higher education to young top students, I reaffirm the idea that opportunities should open up for everyone to enter university.","Dear student, with regards to the writing problems that could affect your GRA score, I would like to call your attention to your use of adjectives. In this essay you used the adjective extraordinary when you should have used the adverb extraordinarily. It is a common mistake among non-native English speakers. I would not worry about it so much in an everyday setting but for the IELTS test, you should avoid making such mistakes in order to retain a higher GRA score. You should also aim for clarity in your essay so try to avoid redundancies such as ""whether or not"". Whether alone is sufficient since it already indicates the two choices a person is to choose from. \n Now, with regards to your prompt paraphrase, you show a clear misunderstanding of the discussion instructions. The original instruction indicates: \n <em>Original Instruction: Discuss both view and give your opinion.<br/>Your Response: Personally, I am more convinced that people all have access to education opportunities regardless of their abilities.</em> \n As such, the assumption of the examiner will be that all of indicated discussions are coming from your personal point of view, rather than the required discussion instruction that considers the two public points of view prior to the formulation of your personal opinion. \n You are not developing the full potential of each paragraph discussion. The lack of clarity in your presentation paragraphs stems from the way that you are discussing 2 points of view per paragraph, without the benefit of a connecting / transition sentence, which works far better in creating a cohesive paragraph than counting your discussion topics. By counting your discussion topics rather than connecting them, you created 2 unblended topic discussions, resulting in a paragraph that lacks explanations and clarity. You tried to get around that problem by using long sentences, called run-ons, which only further added to the confusion of the presentation discussion. Normally, single topic paragraphs work best, specially when done within 3-5 sentences. \n Your concluding paragraphs is only a single sentence, which is also a run-on. It should have been a summary conclusion which reminded the reader of the discussion topic, your discussion reasons, and your personal opinion to close the essay. As it is, the essay is open ended, which means the essay is not properly developed nor closed. \n By the way, use a timer the next time you write the practice essay. You wrote more than 300 words which, when you use a timer, you will find you will be unable to do. The most you will be able to write is between 250-300 words. 300 being a stretch at this point. Remember, \n 1. Use a timer to stay within the time limit and write the appropriate number of words; \n 2. Aim for clarity with every paragraph. Present complete explanations rather than several under explained reasons; \n 3. Properly summarize the conclusion. \n 4. Review your essay, revise the essay, edit the essay, before you submit the essay for scoring.","Your essay presents a thoughtful discussion on whether higher education should be reserved for gifted students or open to people of all abilities. Here's some feedback to help you improve:

1. **Response to Topic**: Your essay addresses the topic by presenting arguments for both perspectives and stating your personal viewpoint. However, it's important to clearly introduce the two views before expressing your own opinion to align with the essay instructions. This will help in making sure you fully address the prompt, showing a balanced discussion before leading to your conclusion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**:
    - Be careful with word usage, especially with adverbs and adjectives. For example, use ""extraordinarily high"" instead of ""extraordinary high"" to improve grammatical accuracy.
    - Avoid redundancies such as ""whether or not."" ""Whether"" alone is sufficient and makes your writing clearer.
    - Watch out for long sentences that might make your essay harder to follow. Try to use a mix of short and long sentences to keep your writing clear and engaging.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your point of view is stated, but it could be made clearer by separating your personal opinion from the discussion of the two perspectives. This separation can be achieved by using transition sentences to smoothly guide the reader from one part of your discussion to the next.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
    - Ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single main idea. This will help in developing clearer and more detailed arguments.
    - Your essay would benefit from a summarizing conclusion that restates the discussion topic, your arguments, and your personal stance. This reinforces your position and provides a strong closing to your essay.

Additional Tips:
- Use a timer when practicing. This helps in managing word count and ensuring that you can complete your essay within the given time limit. Aim for a word count that is manageable within the exam's time constraints, typically around 250-300 words.
- Revise your essay before submission. Look for areas to enhance clarity, check for grammatical accuracy, and ensure that each paragraph contributes effectively to your overall argument.

By taking these points into account, you can make your essay clearer, more coherent, and more persuasive. Remember, practice and revision are key to improving your writing skills.",4,3,3,4,3,3,2,3,3,1,Argumentative

The same thought exists for using a cell phone. There is a growing trend which is supporting the idea of banning cell phone usage in critical locations the same as what happened for smoking. I strongly share the same opinion because it ruins human rights and is a major distractor on certain occasions. \n People often complain that they had been annoyed by the others who have used their cell phones in public places. This behavior is not accepted in public and is against human rights. It will cause physical and psychological impacts on people. Signals which is transmitted by cell phones have destructive effects on our body. The possibility of being affected by brain cancer increased immensely when a large crowd of people uses their cell phones in public places. On the other hand, phone alarms and notification sounds are a serious disturbance factor that threatens social health. Anxiety and stress levels will raise highly by distractions. \n Individually speaking, using cell phones in certain places and occasions has brought the main disadvantages. In workplaces, the staff has spent a significant amount of time with their cell phones which decreased productivity. It takes a considerable amount of time to focus on a piece of work when employees get distracted by a phone call or answering a message. The other case which is more dangerous is using a cell phone while driving. A large portion of car crashes has been happened during using a cell phone for teenagers. There are lots of other reasons playing a huge role in convincing governments for banning cell phone usage. \n In conclusion, smartphones have their own unique benefits and expected to ease human life.

When asked to give an extent response, the reasoning paragraphs always score better when you follow the format below: \n Reasoning 1: General opinion discussion that integrates a personal opinion \n Reasoning 2: Supporting example discussion based upon your personal experience and/or knowledge \n By using the above format, your essay provides a clear discussion that balances the public and personal point of view. The personal example in support of your opinion helps to add clarity & cohesiveness to your presentation. \n While the essay does have several grammatical errors, these do not hamper the understanding of your explanation. However, you need to use a uniform time reference point. For this essay, you should be using the present tense reference as you are discussing events as you know it to be happening in real time. \n The conclusion requires more appropriate information. That means, you have to restate the topic, your reasons, and the degree of your dis/agreement as a recap of the discussion.","The essay in question addresses the topic by drawing parallels between the negative impacts of smoking and the use of cell phones in public spaces, advocating for restrictions on cell phone usage in critical locations. The stance is clear: there is strong support for limiting cell phone use in certain cases due to its detrimental effects on health, productivity, and safety. However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to enhance clarity, cohesiveness, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, while the essay response is on topic, it could benefit from a more structured approach to reasoning. Each argument would be stronger if it followed a specific format: a general opinion or statement, followed by a supporting example drawn from personal experience or known facts. This approach will not only clarify the author's point of view but also provide a balanced representation of both public opinion and personal insight, making the arguments more relatable and persuasive.

There are noticeable spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that, while not overly hindering comprehension, do detract from the essay's professionalism and can be confusing. Attention should be paid to maintaining consistent tense usage throughout the essay to ensure clarity and cohesion. The majority of the essay seems to aim for a present tense narrative, which should be consistently applied to discuss current events and opinions.

The author's point of view is discernable but could be made clearer with a more straightforward presentation of opinions and reasons for those opinions, especially in the conclusion. The conclusion should succinctly restate the topic, summarize the key arguments presented, and clearly reiterate the degree of agreement or disagreement with the proposed cell phone bans. This recap will reinforce the essay's messages and ensure that readers are left with a clear understanding of the author's stance.

Regarding content, the essay's arguments for limiting cell phone use are broad, touching on human rights, health concerns, productivity issues, and safety. While each of these points is valid, they would greatly benefit from more detailed examples and evidence. For instance, citing studies or statistics on the impacts of cell phone radiation, or elaborating on specific experiences where cell phone usage has caused notable disturbances, would substantiate the claims made and enhance the essay's persuasive power.

In summary, focusing on structured reasoning, improving grammar and style, maintaining tense consistency, and strengthening the conclusion will greatly improve the essay's effectiveness. Additionally, incorporating more detailed examples and evidence to support claims will make the arguments more compelling.

I completely agree with this view. \n The rising price of fuel could demotivate the economy's development. When fuel's price is higher, factories have to pay more money for the manufacturing process. This means these factories would sell their products at higher prices to compensate for the gain of fuel's price. From that, customers find it costly and mitigate shopping activities. Many companies can face default risk and have no money to pay for taxes. As a result, the revenue of the government from taxes would be shrinking and would not be adequate to invest in education, infrastructure, and health care systems. The fluctuations in fuel prices are likely to have a devastating effect on the life of all residents. \n Apart from the practical disadvantages expressed above, It is true that raising the cost of fuel would bring numerous benefits to societies. Higher fuel's price means that people have to pay more money to commute to work, which limits the frequency of driving individual cars. Instead, people tend to use public transportation and take fewer flights for savings. These activities could help reduce gas emissions from factories and vehicles, which is the main cause of global warming. \n In conclusion, a thriving economy is necessary; however, we can not ignore the importance of the environment. I believe that imposing higher taxes on fuel can help prevent climate change.","The introduction paraphrase needs to be better presented. The discussion should be divided into at least 3 sentences. The use of the comma in this presentation is incorrect as the writer created a run-on presentation, which should be avoided in all academic paper presentations. The paraphrasing paragraph depicts the ability of the writer to explain what he understood of the original prompt in the clearest and most concise manner. The run-on presentation fails to accomplish that. Consider that an acadmeic paragraph needs at least 3, but no more than 5 sentences to accomplish this task and the writer should be clear as to why a run-on sentence is not going to be helpful to his TA and GRA scores. These observations are important and must be noted by the writer as this error removed the strong scoring poptential of his relevant opinion in the statement. \n The essay is underdeveloped because the second paragraph deviates from the supporting element requirement presentation for the writer's opionion. The essay is not asking the writer to justifify the benefits and drawback of the higher cost of petrol. Rather, it is asking the writer to justify the opinion that was presented by offering an economic and personal reason in relation to his agreement with the provided opinion. The economic aspect was an acceptable discussion but there was no expanded discussion or a related opinion in the second paragraph, a requirement for this type of essay presentation. \n As the essay is only partly correct in presentation, it will also receive a partial score based on the related discussion points. Anything irrelevant to the personal opinion will not be considered and will not recieve a score. Therefore, the writer may receive a low passing score for this essay. The prompt requirements must always be completely met, without any discussion alterations in the presentation, to receive full scoring considerations.","The essay you've written brings up some interesting points about the effects of increasing fuel prices on both the economy and the environment. However, there are several areas where improvements could make your arguments stronger and your essay more aligned with the criteria of an English proficiency test.

1. **Response to the Topic:** 
   - Your essay begins with a statement that suggests agreement with the view that raising fuel prices can protect the environment but then discusses the economic drawbacks extensively. While it's important to discuss both sides, make sure to clearly establish your viewpoint early on. It seems like you agree with the initial statement but also see value in the opposing view without clearly arguing from one position.

2. **Structure and Grammar:** 
   - The introduction of your essay could be improved. Instead of merging many ideas into a single run-on sentence, consider breaking them down into three or more sentences. This will make your introduction clearer and easier to follow. For instance, start with a sentence that presents the topic, followed by a sentence that states the common viewpoints, and conclude with a sentence that clearly presents your position on the matter.
   - Academic paragraphs typically require at least three sentences to be complete but should not exceed five sentences to remain concise. This structure helps in maintaining clarity and ensuring that each paragraph effectively communicates a single main idea or argument.
   - Be mindful of using commas correctly to avoid run-on sentences. Run-on sentences can make your essay hard to follow and detract from its professional quality.

3. **Development of Ideas:**
   - The essay would benefit from a more detailed exploration of your viewpoints. While you mention economic reasons, there's a missed opportunity to delve deeper into personal or societal implications that support your stance. For example, discussing how higher fuel prices might personally affect individuals or benefit society as a whole could strengthen your argument.
   - It's crucial to focus on supporting your main viewpoint throughout. Introducing benefits of higher fuel costs is valuable, but ensure these discussions directly reinforce your position rather than appearing as an unbiased comparison.
   
4. **Coherence and Cohesion:**
   - Aim to make clearer transitions between paragraphs to guide the reader smoothly from one idea to the next. This can be achieved by using transition words or phrases and by ensuring that each paragraph logically follows from the one before it.

5. **Relevance of Content:**
   - Make sure all discussions directly relate to the question asked and your chosen viewpoint. Any deviation or introduction of irrelevant points might distract from the strength of your argument and impact the scoring of your essay.

In conclusion, focusing on a clear structure, ensuring the relevance of your arguments to your thesis, and avoiding grammatical errors will substantially improve your essay.

This essay will discuss both pros and cros of this view. \n There are several advantages of effective public transport. To begin with, the traffic issue would be controlled if public transport, like bus or subway, runned effectively, representing a symbol of civilized and modern society. On a large scale, traveling easily enhances the economic growth as people would not waste time on traffic jam. For example, a businessman could save his time up to one and half hour to go to his workplace every morning on time by subway instead of being stuck in traffic jam in his private car. Moreover, the tourist industry in a city is also promoted when foreigner visitors no longer run the risk of being victimized by the fraud by passenger motorcycle. Last but not least, public transport help people save money since most of them costs much cheaper than taxi or private car. \n Despite the advantages, public transportation has its various disadvantages. It is undeniable that public transport is unlikely to reach anywhere as they find it difficult to access the remote or isolated areas. Buses in Ha Noi city, for example, are unable to bring all passengers to anywhere they want, given that the Hanoi's infrastructure is so complicated. In addition, as the number of public transport is limited, they fall short of people's traveling needs. Finally, the quality of public transport services also needs to be improved because this would encourage citizens to use public transport instead of driving a car. \n In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages of public transport existed, the demand of advancing and expanding public transport is inevitable for a modern city.","Thu, here is the thing.

However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to enhance clarity, coherence, and response to the task.

Firstly, the essay should strictly adhere to the topic by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of public transportation in a modern city without introducing a personal viewpoint, especially in the conclusion. The task does not ask for persuasion but for a balanced discussion. Therefore, the concluding section should not advocate for a specific outcome but rather summarize the points discussed.

The introduction of the essay could be improved for a stronger start. It needs at least three sentences that effectively restate the task and introduce what will be discussed. This shows an understanding of the task and demonstrates the ability to use varied vocabulary and structure. An improved opening might clarify the critical role of public transport in a modern city and explicitly state the intent to compare its pros and cons.

Regarding content organization, it is crucial to focus on a single advantage or disadvantage within each paragraph and explore it thoroughly. This approach allows for clearer and more detailed explanations, showcasing the ability to analyze and discuss topics in depth. The current essay attempts to cover too many ideas, which dilutes the focus and weakens the argumentation.

In your writing, remember that organizing your thoughts and limiting the scope of discussion can enhance the clarity and impact of your points. It’s better to discuss fewer ideas in greater detail than to briefly mention many. This strategy helps maintain the reader's interest and demonstrates your analytical skills.

Additionally, there are some grammatical and stylistic issues that need to be addressed. For instance, the phrase ""runned effectively"" should be corrected to ""ran effectively,"" and ""cros"" should be spelled as ""cons."" It's important to proofread your essay to catch and correct such errors.

Lastly, ensure that each paragraph, including the conclusion, is sufficiently developed, typically consisting of at least three sentences. This structure helps in creating a well-organized and fully explained argument.

However, several areas can be improved to make the essay more impactful and aligned with academic standards.

Firstly, it's crucial that the essay directly addresses the topic from the beginning. The introduction seems to stray slightly from forming a clear stance, which can affect the overall clarity and strength of your position. Ensuring that the opening sentence clearly presents your thesis or main argument will significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness.

Regarding the presentation of opinions, there's a need to distinguish between general beliefs and your personal viewpoint more clearly. Use specific phrases to indicate when you're stating a widely held opinion versus when you're sharing your personal perspective. This will help in providing a structured comparison and make the essay adhere to a more appropriate response format.

Concerning spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several points to note:
- Pay attention to the spelling of words (e.g., ""usualy"" should be ""usually,"" ""prefered"" should be ""preferred,"" and ""expertise"" as a noun should be used correctly in context).
- Watch out for grammatical mistakes, such as the agreement between subject and verb and the correct use of past participle forms.
- Be mindful of capitalization errors (""B eing"" should be corrected to ""Being"").
- There's a stylistic gap in using conjunctions and transitions smoothly (""Meanwhile,"" at the start of the second sentence, might be better replaced with connectors that more naturally segue between ideas).

To improve cohesiveness, consider organizing your arguments more systematically. Each paragraph should ideally open with a clear topic sentence that introduces the argument or point you're about to discuss. Then, provide specific examples or evidence to back up your claims before concluding the paragraph by linking back to your overall thesis. This structure not only enhances clarity but also ensures that your arguments effectively support your stance.

On the point of view, it is evident that you are trying to merge a collective viewpoint with personal experience. While this approach can enrich the essay, clarity in distinguishing between these perspectives would prevent confusion and strengthen your argumentation. Use phrases like ""In my opinion"" or ""From my perspective"" when transitioning to personal insights to maintain a clear voice throughout.

In conclusion, integrating some general knowledge and skills alongside pursuing personal interests is indeed beneficial, as discussed in the essay. Improving on the areas highlighted - the alignment of opinions, clarity of argument, and grammatical precision - will undeniably make your essay more compelling and academically sound. Remember, the goal is to communicate your ideas as clearly and effectively as possible, and focusing on these aspects will greatly help in achieving that.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

**1. Essay Response and Structure:**
The structure of your essay does not align with the expected format for this type of essay, specifically a comparison or discussion essay. To improve, consider organizing your essay into the following parts:
- **Introduction:** briefly restate the prompt to introduce the essay topic and clearly present your viewpoint.
- **Body Paragraphs:** dedicate at least one paragraph to each main point you want to discuss. For example, one paragraph could discuss the benefits of unpaid work by young people, and another could explore the disadvantages.

WHAT ARE THE CAUSES?,"It is true that in recent years traffic congestion in a number of leading cities is becoming progressively problematic. There are a number of causes caused by this phenomenon and several measures can be implemented to cope up with the situation. \n The traffic congestion may result in two main issues. Firstly, traffic jams during the rush hour in light of the fact that people frequently finish their work and comeback home at 5pm every day. For example, a Vietnamese article shows that around 45% Vietnamese employees often finish there work at 5pm, so that tendency leads to traffic jams. Secondly, cars and road space are not used efficiently. For instance, the average car, is 80% empty when it is being driven by a single person. And most of the day, cars are totally empty and its requirements zone for parking on the street. \n Fortunately, a variety of solutions can be implemented by the government. Firstly, workers should share their cars and travel together consequently cars cannot be empty and have more road area for people. For instance, a car has 4 or even 7 seats, they can take 4 or 7 people together so they do not need to use their own car to occupy the area. In addition, public transport needs to be reliable and efficient. In fact, they can use bus or subway instead of using their own vehicle to travel to work due to the fact it does wonders for environment to save the fresh air and can restrict city traffic. \n To sum up, traffic jams during the rush hour and cars and road space are not used efficiently are two main major causes of traffic congestion. In order to solve these problems, a combination of methods should be applied by the government of each nation.","<quotation>It is true</quotation> \n Avoid providing a personal opinion in the restatement paragraph.

However, there are several ways in which the essay could be improved to make it clearer and more professional.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity**:
It is essential to present the topic factually without adding personal opinions in the introduction. Instead of starting with ""It is true,"" consider rephrasing to neutrally present the issue of traffic congestion. This approach ensures that the essay remains objective and closely aligned with the given prompt.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:
While the essay largely uses correct spelling, some grammatical and stylistic issues need attention. For example, avoiding starting sentences with conjunctions like ""And"" will elevate the writing's academic tone. Additionally, ensuring that sentences are complete and ideas are fully explained will improve clarity. For instance, the sentence discussing cars being empty and requiring parking zones is confusing and could be more clearly expressed.

3. **Point of View Clarity**:
The essay's viewpoint on addressing traffic congestion is clear. However, refining the introduction and conclusion to directly address the issue and solutions without personal opinions will strengthen the author's stance.

4. **Argument Support**:
The essay contains examples and potential solutions, which is excellent. However, expanding on these ideas with more precise details and explanations would strengthen the arguments. For instance, when discussing the inefficiency of car usage, providing more comprehensive solutions or statistics could bolster the point. Additionally, ensuring that the readers understand how suggested solutions, like car-sharing and improved public transport, directly address the identified problems will make the arguments more persuasive.

To enhance the conclusion, it is beneficial to briefly recap the proposed methods to resolve traffic congestion, reinforcing the essay's key points. This recap helps to ensure that the essay finishes on a strong note, summarizing the main arguments for easy recall by the reader.

I can partially agree that employers should pay more attention to employees' individual qualities, since their education and working experience are also not less important. \n On the one hand, while qualifications can be achieved within a couple of years, personal values and appropriate talents for certain jobs are human nature, which makes recruiters should estimate this criterion over the others . Besides, individuals with superior personalities can greatly boost the business of their company with their enthusiasm, strong commitment and even creativity. For example, some of the world's greatest men including Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, both of whom didn't graduate from universities but made huge differences that changed the world thanks to their outstanding traits. \n On the other hand, however, there are many jobs that require high level of education and certain qualifications. These requirements are crucial standards to illustrate that a person have full ability to practice in some domain. To be a doctor, for instance, a man has to study for average 5 to 7 years along with a dozen training courses of surgery practicing, afterward he can cure people.

These are the sentence writing limitations of the writer that affected the clarity and easy understanding of the presentation. By incorrectly focusing on word choice rather than using simple references in the presentation, the writer unintentionally over- complicated the writing and removed the basic clarity of the explanation. it is this writing approach that produced errors in the paragraph presentations.","The essay successfully addresses the topic by exploring the importance of personality traits and qualifications in hiring decisions, making it clear that understanding the question isn't an issue. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make the essay stronger and more coherent.

1. **Clarity and Structure**: One of the main challenges in the essay is the clarity of the thoughts and arguments. It's essential to organize ideas more neatly within paragraphs to ensure each point is clear and easy to follow. Starting with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph can help, followed by examples and explanations to support this idea.

2. **Simplifying Language**: The essay tends to use complicated language and sentences, which makes it harder to understand. It's better to use simpler words and phrases that convey the message more directly. Remember, a straightforward sentence can often have a more significant impact than a complex one that's hard to decipher.

3. **Grammar and Word Choice**: Pay close attention to word selection, grammar, and sentence structure. For instance, the phrase ""In nowadays industrialized world"" could be simplified to ""In today's industrialized world"" for clarity and correctness. Similarly, watch out for awkward phrasings and consider rewording them for better readability. Including transitional words or phrases between ideas can also help the essay flow more smoothly.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay does a good job of presenting both sides of the argument regarding the importance of personal traits versus qualifications. However, examples used (like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs) could be expanded upon to better support the case for the significance of personal traits. On the qualifications side, providing more detailed examples or evidence would strengthen the argument.

5. **Point of View**: While the essay hints at a balanced perspective, making a more definitive stance clear at the beginning could help guide the reader through the argument. It's okay to acknowledge the importance of both traits and qualifications, but highlighting which one you believe should be prioritized and why can make the essay more persuasive.

6. **Conclusion**: A strong concluding paragraph that summarizes the main points and reiterates the essay’s stance could enhance the overall impact. It would serve to remind the reader of the essay's central arguments and leave them with something to ponder.

Improving these aspects of the essay could significantly enhance its clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness in communicating the argument.

To what extent do you agree or disagr,"It is argued that life was more fulfilling when technology was less advanced. I completely disagree with this statement and support the idea that technological advancement makes life better. The essay will first discuss how smartphones save us time and then talk about how the internet has made us improve education. \n Smartphones proved to save people a ton of time just by clicking on the screen. In the past, if people wanted to send a message to others, they would have to go to the post office and wait for a few days for the message to be delivered. However, with the appearance of the internet, messages can be transferred to receivers in just a click with nearly no pending time. For instance, Facebook, one of the most common chat platforms, allows billions of users to send messages with just a tap with no delay time. Hence, thanks to mobile phones, humans are now reaping the benefits of fast information exchange and improving life. \n Not only advance communication, but technology also enhances education. Never ever before, humans can quickly search for information that they need in a fast and precise way. In the past, if students wanted to look up a specific topic, they would need a huge amount of effort, such as finding related books or articles to read through, and these references can also be pricey to them. However, with technological enhancement, educational resources are plenty available and can be accessed at any time at no additional cost. For example, Google search is the most common search tool nowadays, users can look up whatever they want, and Google will respond back with millions of related results in milliseconds. \n In conclusion, technology has made human life more convenient and better than ever before in terms of saving time and enhancing education.","<quotation>The essay will first ...</quotation> \n This is an unnecessary reference point in this presentation. The 2 sentence restatement and writer's opinion that clearly comes with a thesis statement was more than enough to get a good score for the paragraph. The additional sentence worked negatively and instead, moved the paragraph towards receiving deductions instead. \n <quotation>they would have to go to the post office</quotation> \n Incorrect example reference. People who needed instant responses back then would have sent telegrams or called people over the landline phone. Both instruments were considered cutting edge technology at the time because it offered ease of communication and speed of response.

You did a better job in the second paragraph. \n Your concluding summary is incorrectly presented as it does not follow the 2 sentences, 40 word requirement for the reverse paraphrase presentation in that section.","This essay discusses whether life was more fulfilling with less advanced technology, arguing that technological progress has, in fact, made life better. The focus is on how technology, particularly smartphones and the internet, has saved time and enhanced education. Here's an analysis based on the requested aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay directly addresses the topic, presenting a clear stance against the notion that life was more fulfilling with less technology. The introduction sets the stage for arguments supporting the positive impacts of technological advancements.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the spelling and grammar are correct. However, the essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures to make the arguments more engaging. Also, avoid stating what the essay will discuss in the introduction (""The essay will first discuss...""), as this can be redundant and weaken the impact of your thesis statement. Instead, jump straight into making your argument. 

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The author's viewpoint is clear and consistent throughout the essay. The stance that technological advancements have improved life is well-supported with specific examples related to communication and education.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While the arguments presented support the author's view, they could be strengthened. For instance, when discussing communication advancements, offering a more accurate historical perspective can enhance credibility. Suggesting that people relied solely on mail ignores other technologies like telegrams and landline phones, which also sped up communication before the internet. Providing a broader context here would make for a stronger argument. When elaborating on how technology enhances education, the argument is stronger and well-supported with the example of Google searches providing quick and free access to a vast amount of information.

In the conclusion, aim for more precision in summarizing your arguments. It's critical to reframe your main points succinctly to reinforce your stance effectively. Adhering to specific requirements (if any), such as paraphrasing your thesis in a set number of words, can also help ensure the essay meets all expectations.

**Additional Suggestions**: Fine-tune your essay by directly citing evidence or studies where possible, adding depth to your arguments. Also, consider contrasting your points with common counterarguments and refuting them to show a well-rounded understanding of the topic. This approach can enrich your essay and provide a more complex analysis of how technological advancements contribute to improvements in life. 

In summary, your essay presents a solid foundation in arguing for the benefits of technology. By refining your argumentative strategies and paying close attention to the structure and content accuracy, you can enhance the persuasiveness and effectiveness of your writing.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,5,4,1,Argumentative

The first important advantage of globalization is that it is a vert necessary motivation that pushes the development of the economy. It cannot deny that business is becoming increasingly international and this means free trade between the countries with different political institutions and strengthen the political relationship. Vietnam, a communist country is ready to cooperate with every country around the world like America, Japan, or even Russia and Cuba. Many people completely agree that globalization is the vital factor that creates employment opportunities, reduces poverty, and improves working conditions, especially in developing countries. In the globalized society, developed countries and large corporations tend to shift and invest in less developed countries. Vietnam is currently calling for investment form any countries and the government report is that foreign investors increasingly 56% over the same period last year. \n The primary weakness of the globalization is that can also lead to unemployment and exploitation because the rate of the skilled worker over the total number of worker has been lower and lower. This can generate redundancies and jobless among the people who are not trained and they are ready to accept the low salary and work in the poor conditions to earn a living. China, the largest factory in the world where has a lot of cheap labor so that many foreign businesses are moving to this country to hire this cheap labor force. These workers have to work under poor conditions as well as work long hours a day with low wages. Many people agree that globalization is the cause of environmental pollution because the developed countries move old machines and outdated technology to set up companies for cost savings. Therefore, their wastewater treatment technology is not up to international standards and these wastes contain a lot of toxic substances that can cause pollution when released into the environment. Some years ago, Vietnam to cope with environmental disasters, especially the marine environment when the Formosa steel factory has dumped a lot of waste into the waters of the central province and according to experts predict it will take us about fifty years to restore such waters. \n To sum up, globalization not only has some positive consequences but also brings negative results. However, globalization is a popular trend that can be inevitable because there are more benefits than drawbacks","There is a glaring error in the approach that you took to this discussion. The original prompt asks you to take a stance as to whether globalization has its drawbacks. The answer is either yest or no, with justifications. It is not a comparative essay as you mistakenly instructed in your prompt paraphrase. You also used the term ""tread"" when you meant to use the word ""trend"". There is a big difference between the two words. Look it up. Never use words in the essay that just sound correct to you. If you are not sure of the spelling or word meaning, do not use it. That will immediately drag down your LR and GRA scores. I am not sure why you are discussing a dark side. making the essay graver than the original topic sounds. \n The essay itself is not properly formatted for a 40 minute time frame. You presented a class opinion paper, a research paper length discussion when this should have only been a 20 sentence paper at the most. You have over discussed and, in an actual setting, would not have been able to complete this type of presentation. You need to review the work of other students so that you can get a better idea of how to write a quick response essay that will be complete in discussion and acceptable in terms of format. This essay went overboard. It would not work within an actual test setting, regardless of whether it is computer or pencil based.","The essay presents a discussion on globalization, acknowledging both its advantages and downsides. However, the initial instruction was misunderstood. The task was to debate whether globalization has drawbacks, requiring a clear stance backed by reasons. The essay, instead, embarks on a comparison, lacking a definitive position.

Firstly, there's a noticeable mix-up with the word usage - ""tread"" appears to have been used instead of ""trend"". This suggests a misunderstanding of the word's meaning, which can significantly impact the clarity and quality of the argument. It's crucial to only use words when their meaning and spelling are known to avoid confusing the reader and reducing the essay's effectiveness.

Furthermore, the essay's structure and depth do not align with the expected format of a quick response. A concise 20-sentence limit is suggested for tasks of this nature to ensure clear and precise communication of ideas within a limited timeframe. The current essay extends beyond this with a more detailed exploration suited to a longer, research-style paper. This could hinder the ability to complete and effectively convey the necessary points within a test scenario.

In terms of content, while the essay does provide examples and attempts to offer a balanced view, the focus wavers and fails to conclusively support a specific standpoint on the drawbacks of globalization, as was required. This lack of clarity could be addressed by stating a clear position on the issue and then consistently using examples and arguments to support that stance.

To improve, consider simplifying the essay by:
- Clearly presenting a stance on the prompt at the beginning.
- Reducing extraneous information to focus on key arguments supporting the chosen position.
- Ensuring word usage is precise and correct by double-checking meanings and spellings.
- Tailoring the essay's length and depth to the expected quick response format, keeping it concise and to the point.

This essay will discuss why the belief given above is completely acceptable and provide some forms of discipline that could be used to control the young's behavior \n I concur that forming a child's personality from an early age by teaching the right and wrong is absolutely crucial. If children are able to recognize what should do and what should not do, they would have a strong determination to resolve a problem properly. Besides, this educational strategy has functions to enhance juvenile's critical thinking, which is useful for their future development, especially in their academic performance. Punishment is compatible with children's process of achieving this distinction. Parent or teaching staffs could impose a mild penalty on children's wrongdoing so that they would remember to eliminate their inappropriate behavior. \n In terms of penalty methods, I opine that both parent and teachers should avoid harsh punishments. Mentally abusing, smacking, hitting, etc could potentially leave children psychologically damaged. Instead, it is recommended that the young should be given constructive penalty which enable them to realize their mistakes. For examples, taking away a child's favorite toy for a day if there has been any misbehavior, he or she will remember not to repeat that mistake \n In conclusion, I believe that shaping children's personality through constructive punishment is imperative for the social sustainable development.","The essay is short in terms of discussion requirements.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, depth, and adherence to the essay prompt.

1. **Response to Topic**:
   The essay attempts to address the given topic but falls short in fully engaging with it. The task was to explore personal viewpoints on disciplining children, including the roles of parents and teachers, and suggest non-physical forms of punishment. Clarifying the personal standpoint further and elaborating on specific responsibilities of parents and teachers regarding discipline could strengthen the essay. For example, discussing how discipline strategies may differ at home versus in a classroom setting, and suggesting alternatives to corporal punishment based on personal or observed experiences, would provide a more comprehensive analysis.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, Stylistic Issues**:
   The essay is generally well-written but has minor grammatical and stylistic inconsistencies. Pay attention to verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (""the taught"" should be ""be taught,"" ""juvenile's"" should be ""juveniles' ""). Also, consider varying sentence structure to enhance readability and engagement. Avoiding repetition of phrases and ensuring consistent use of terms (e.g., ""penalty"" vs. ""punishment"") can make the argument more compelling.

3. **Author's Point of View**:
   Your point of view comes across in the essay, yet it could be articulated more clearly and directly. Using the first-person pronoun ""I"" more assertively to state your opinions and experiences can make your arguments more personal and persuasive. For instance, instead of saying, ""This essay will discuss,"" you might say, ""I believe that it is crucial to discipline children in a constructive way, and here is why.""

4. **Arguments and Support**:
   While the essay provides general arguments in favor of non-physical punishment, these could be strengthened with more detailed examples and clearer connections to the essay's main claims. Discussing specific non-corporal punishments that have been effective, either from personal experience or observed practices, and explaining why these approaches are beneficial, will help solidify your position. Additionally, expanding your discussion to include the unique roles that parents and teachers play in disciplining children will add depth to the essay.

5. **Conclusion Improvements**:
   The concluding paragraph needs to succinctly summarize the key points made in the essay and revisit the central statement, providing closure. A more structured conclusion that restates your viewpoint, summarizes the arguments made, and looks forward to the implications of your discussion would enhance the overall effectiveness of the essay.

By addressing these areas, the essay can become more engaging, informative, and aligned with the requirements of the task.

3. **Author’s Point of View**: Your viewpoint becomes more apparent as the essay progresses, especially when you discuss the importance of preserving traditional music. To strengthen your argument, ensure your position is clear from the outset. Opening with a direct statement about your stance on traditional versus modern music could clarify your point of view.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: You’ve outlined arguments supporting the significance of both traditional and modern music. However, for a more robust essay, especially in a language proficiency test context, grounding your arguments in personal experiences or broadly recognizable narratives rather than specific studies would be more effective. For example, share a memory of how traditional music made you feel connected to your culture or how a modern song influenced your perspective on an issue.

Your essay offers thoughtful reflections on an engaging topic. Enhancing your response to be more aligned with personal insights and experiences, clarifying your grammatical and stylistic approach, ensuring your viewpoint is unmistakably communicated from the beginning, and supporting your position with relatable examples or narratives will undoubtedly elevate the quality of your writing.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4564,https://essayforum.com/writing/older-people-compete-younger-same-jobs-92001/,dev,"Nowadays, more and more older people need to compete with the younger people for the same jobs","In recent years, the labour market is becoming more remarkably competitive than before, with the competition between the different ages in search of the same jobs. There are a number of problems that can explain this trend; some solutions need to be implemented to tackle these potential problems. \n The chief problem is the employee's real experience. It is obvious that older candidates possess a richer source of experience compared to the younger counterparts who are struggling to find a secure job after graduation. Therefore, recruiters have preferences in hiring aged people which leads to the shortage of work for young generations in job hunting. In addition, the workforce is less productive. Junior workers tend to be more energetic and dynamic; in contrast, the senior workers may have lower levels of productivity due to their health problems or timetables for child rearing. \n However, there are a range of possible options to solve the problems. One effective way to deal with this is governments should implement new regulations to decrease the retirement age. Therefore, young generations may alleviate competitive pressures on landing a job. Another answer is that enterprises ought to use both junior and senior employees to create a diversified working environment. Two age groups have the opportunity to learn skills as well as knowledge with each other . This contributes to bringing huge benefits for their firms. \n In conclusion, various measures can be taken to solve the problems caused by the competition between old generations and younger counterparts.","Good work on the creative prompt restatement that totally changed the word usage from the original, without changing the topic focus. It is clear that you are referring to the age competition among the young and old. You clearly understood how the rephrasing should be presented to the examiner. \n However, you failed to provide convincing opinion thesis statements because, rather than responding to the questions provided, you offered a repeat of the questions instead. By repeating the instructions, you did not provide your clear opinion in relation to the 2 discussion questions provided. There are supposed to be 2 discussion topic references that should tie in with your forthcoming explanation paragraphs. So you will recieve points for the restatement, but will not receive enough point considerations for the thesis statements due to the lack of its proper representation in the paragraph. \n You have very strong discussion paragraphs that clearly and appropriately represent the problems and solutions as required. There is a clear relationship between the discussion paragraphs as well. The topics presented are coherent and cohesive. Good work. You stayed on track regarding both discussion questions and developed these ideas in a manner that increases your overall score. Word usage was simple, but applicable to the discussion. You did not seek to impress the examiner with advanced English words used out of context. The simplicity of your discussion is the overall strength of this presentation. \n The conclusion is problematic though. You wrote less than 40 words in that paragraph. It lacks the required elements of: \n - Topic restatement \n - Summarized causes \n - Summarized solutions \n - Closing sentence \n This inaccurate summary conclusion, along with the incorrectly formatted opinion statement in the restatement+opinion paragraph are the weakest portions of this presentation. These will be the score reducing sections and can really pull down your final score in the process. These are the sections you should work on improving the next time you write a prompt that uses the causes and solutions format.","The essay does an excellent job in creatively restating the topic, maintaining focus on the competition between different age groups in the labor market. This restatement clearly shows an understanding of the task without changing its meaning. However, the essay falls short in presenting a clear opinion or thesis statement in relation to the provided questions. Rather than giving a clear stance or point of view, the essay repeats the questions, which does not satisfy the requirement for a convincing opinion or thesis statement. It's crucial to directly state your viewpoint in relation to the discussion topics early on in your essay to guide the reader through your arguments.

Your discussion paragraphs are notably strong, presenting the problems and solutions coherently and cohesively. You've done well to stay on track with both discussion questions, developing these ideas in a manner that positively contributes to the overall presentation of the essay. The use of simple, yet appropriate, language throughout these paragraphs is commendable, as it keeps the essay accessible without compromising the discussion's quality.

On the other hand, the conclusion of the essay needs significant improvement. It currently lacks the necessary components, including a topic restatement, a summary of causes and solutions, and a closing sentence, resulting in a conclusion that is too brief and not fully effective. Expanding the conclusion to include these elements will provide a more satisfactory closure to your essay.

Furthermore, there are a few spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, being consistent with tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement would enhance the readability of your essay. It's also advisable to vary sentence structure to maintain reader interest and engagement throughout.

In summary, while the essay demonstrates a good understandings of the topic and presents strong discussion points, improvements are needed in the thesis statement clarity, conclusion development, and some aspects of grammar and style.

However, some people are opposed to this idea, claiming that students should be allowed to use mobile phones. From my perspective, parents should let their children use their phones during the school day, and I will further elaborate in this essay. \n It seems clear that phone should be used during school day for several reasons. Aside from calling for an emergency, students make use of their phones to do research. With the colossal amount of information on the Internet, learners can easily look up whatever they are required to. For example, during a science class, teachers ask the students to do a survey on solar system (or anything impossible to see), the only way to learn about it is collecting information on the Internet. \n While phones are encouraged to be used wisely, some people recommend excluding it from being used at school. Some parents may have fear for their children not paying attention in class. Using mobile phones for personal reasons during class can result in several consequences. Phones can be allowed to use but can also be prohibited, depending on the time of the students using their phone. If it happened to be banned, parents should only take it after class. For instance, were their children happen to be in trouble in class, they would directly call you up for help. In truth, some imperative measures ought to be taken to resolve the problem if any students use their phones during class. Teachers should collect all of them at the beginning of the class and give them back at the end of the lesson. \n In conclusion, phones should be let use during school day but for a period of time to make sure that students can concentrate on their lesson appropriately.","You have not changed the original prompt presentation to the point of presenting your understanding of the original idea. You have used too many of the original reference points without changing the words. The restatement section will be seen as being more of a cut and paste job on your part rather than a presentation of the original, based upon how you understood it. That means the TA score will not be good for this section, most specially since there is no clear opinion outline in the thesis sentence part at the end. The examiner already knows you will elaborate on your response, what he wants to know is, the reason for your response that you will be expanding on in the 3 paragraphs to follow. \n You have to use third person pronouns in the first 2 reasoning paragraphs . That is because you are presenting the opinion of other people and explaining their belief. While others will tell you that you should avoid using pronouns and make general statements instead, please remember that your GRA score is based upon your understanding of how to properly use English grammar rules, that includes pronoun usage. Without the pronoun usage in the third person, the essay becomes solely a personal general statement, which is not the purpose of the essay.","The essay presents a significant viewpoint concerning whether phones should be utilized during the school day. While the stance in favor of allowing phone use for educational and emergency purposes is clear, there are several areas where the essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and alignment with the essay prompt.

1. **Response to Topic:**
   The introduction of the essay closely mirrors the original prompt without sufficiently rephrasing or presenting a unique understanding. To enhance the response to the prompt, it's beneficial to rephrase the introduction to reflect a personal interpretation or a fresh perspective on the issue. Including a concise statement of your own viewpoint in the thesis statement, alongside a brief explanation of why this stance is taken, would provide a stronger foundation for the essay. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   The essay would benefit from careful attention to grammatical structure and pronoun usage. Specifically, when discussing others' opinions or general facts, using third-person pronouns (he, she, they) can add clarity and maintain a formal tone. This also aids in differentiating between the general consensus and the author's personal perspective. Correcting minor grammatical errors and ensuring verb tense consistency will also enhance the readability of the essay. For instance, in the phrase ""phones should be let use during school day,"" consider revising to ""phones should be allowed to be used during the school day.""

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:**
   While the essay indicates a preference for allowing phone use in schools, articulating this viewpoint more explicitly at the beginning and end of the essay would strengthen its impact. Stating the main reasons for this stance in the introductory paragraph will prepare the reader for the arguments that follow. 

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   The essay provides examples and scenarios where phone use could be beneficial; however, these could be expanded upon for greater effect. For more persuasive and descriptive arguments, consider including specific studies, statistics, or real-life examples that demonstrate the positive impact of phone use in educational settings. Additionally, addressing potential counterarguments with evidence-based refutations would offer a more balanced and persuasive discussion.

In summary, focusing on rephrasing the prompt to reflect a unique perspective, using third-person pronouns appropriately, clarifying the author's viewpoint, and bolstering arguments with specific evidence, will significantly enhance the effectiveness and coherence of the essay.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4566,https://essayforum.com/writing/unpaid-community-service-compulsory-high-77446/,dev,"Unpaid community service should be a compulsory high school program, do you agree or disagree?","There is much controversy about whether high school students should be forced to do unpaid community service. I think that taking part in community service can bring positive effects to the youngsters, but it should not be a compulsory program in school education. \n There are two advantages for students to work for their own community. The main benefit is that it helps high school students to establish a sense of community. Community service, such as working for local charities, cleaning the neighborhood environment or companying the elderly, provides pupils a chance to connect with their neighbors and have a better understanding of their hometown. Another positive impact is that students can acquire practical experience and learn how to communicate with other people. Compared to the traditional curriculum, community service can help students to develop social skills, teamwork ability. These are all crucial factors for the youngsters to lead a better future life. \n In spite of the above arguments, I believe that schools should not enforce students to take part in unpaid community service. Firstly, community service would shorten pupils' private time. Nowadays, students have to spend a long period of time at school and have a large amount of homework to do after school. The compulsory community service would not only shorten their time to finish homework assignments but also increase their pressure. Secondly, it is unfair for high school students to serve the community without salary. All of the local residents should take the responsibility to make the community better. If they decide to hire the students to serve the community, community councils or organizations should pay the appropriate salary for students. \n In conclusion, although there are some advantages for students to serve the community, I disagree with the idea of compelling high school students to do unpaid community service.","Dear student, I am sorry but your approach to the opening statement is not the proper one for this type of essay prompt. The opening statement should sound more similar to the original prompt when you restate it. Therefore, the thesis statement you present at the end, should be made in a similar manner to the prompt discussion instruction. It would have been better if you said: \n <em>At the moment, unpaid community service is not yet a compulsory high school program. Some educators believe that it should be turned into a regular part of the curriculum. I disagree with this suggestion for a number of reasons.</em> \n Remember, you are trying to explain what the original prompt topic is all about. Your presentation deviated in a manner from the original prompt which made you create your prompt requirement. This would result in a failed overall score for the essay. \n This is not an advantage and disadvantage essay. That is where you made a mistake in your understanding.

Make sure you understand what the prompt discussion requirements are before you start outlining the essay. \n By the way, you need to make sure that you do not go over the 5 sentence maximum requirement per paragraph. Practice saying more with less sentences. That is the best way to score high in the C&C section.","This essay discusses whether high school students should be mandated to engage in unpaid community service. The approach to addressing the topic shows understanding but requires refinement for a stronger alignment with the essay prompt. Here's a detailed feedback to enhance the essay's effectiveness:

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay's opening statement needs to mirror the prompt more closely. Instead of introducing the topic in a general manner, directly state your position as the prompt suggests. For example, clarifying that unpaid community service is not currently compulsory but there's a discussion on making it so, and then stating your disagreement, will immediately present your thesis in line with the discussion requirements.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:** The essay successfully outlines reasons for disagreement with compulsory unpaid community service, highlighting benefits and concerns. However, the structure can be more coherent by clearly distinguishing between the introduction of the topic, supporting arguments, and the conclusion. Ensuring that each paragraph focuses on a single idea will improve readability and strength of argument.

3. **Stylistic Issues:** Pay attention to sentence length and paragraph structure. Aim to express your thoughts clearly and concisely, avoiding overly long sentences and paragraphs. To increase the essay's effectiveness, strive for no more than five sentences per paragraph. This practice helps in making your points more digestible and impactful for the reader.

4. **Spelling and Grammar:** There are minor grammatical issues that can be addressed by carefully proofreading. For instance, consider refining phrases like ""companying the elderly"" to ""accompanying the elderly"". Ensuring correct grammar and usage will enhance the professionalism and clarity of your essay.

5. **Argument Support and Clarity of Opinion:** Your opinion is clear, but ensure it's supported by focused arguments. The essay seems to explore both pros and cons, which might confuse readers about its stance. Stick to providing strong, clear support for your view. Expanding on how enforcing unpaid service may affect students negatively with specific examples can strengthen your argument.

6. **Understanding Essay Requirements:** It's crucial to fully understand the essay's requirements before beginning. This essay mistakenly adopts a balanced view typical of advantage and disadvantage essays rather than focusing solely on supporting your opinion as required. Future essays will benefit significantly from initial clarity on what the prompt asks for.

Overall, the essay has a good foundation with relevant points. With the suggested adjustments, especially in aligning with the prompt's requirements and improving sentence structure and coherence, the essay can be significantly enhanced.

However, there are several areas where the essay can be improved to meet the requirements of the prompt more effectively and to ensure clarity in its arguments.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The prompt asks to what extent you agree or disagree with a given statement, but the essay seems to present a comparison rather than taking a clear stance. It’s important to clearly express either agreement or disagreement with the statement and support that viewpoint throughout the essay. Remember, the essay should not look like a comparison between views unless you explicitly choose a 'partially agree' approach. Clarifying the stance from the beginning will make your essay more focused.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that impede understanding. For example, ""traditional point of view claims that nature grants sacred giving birth duty for only woman"" could be revised to be clearer and more grammatically correct, such as ""The traditional viewpoint is that nature assigns women the sacred duty of giving birth and, consequently, the primary responsibility of child-rearing."" Paying attention to grammar and punctuation, such as the correct use of plural forms and verb tenses, will improve readability and coherence. Using simpler sentences might help in making the arguments more straightforward and easier to understand.

3. **Clarity of Author’s Point of View**: The essay should make its argument stronger by stating a clear viewpoint at the beginning and sticking to it throughout. Instead of discussing the importance of fatherhood and then the necessity of shared parenting, state clearly how strongly you agree or disagree with the idea that child-rearing should or should not be the exclusive domain of women.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: The points made about the roles of both parents in a child’s development are generally good, but they need to be directly linked to the thesis and more clearly articulated. For example, explaining how shared responsibilities contribute to a more comprehensive development of the child could strengthen the argument. Citing specific studies or statistics could also lend credibility and depth.

A more accurate way to start could be, ""For those interested in rural life, having a farm with certain features is a common dream.""

In terms of language accuracy, there is a noticeable mistake with the use of ""there"" instead of ""these"" (""Then there will be harmless..."" should be ""Then they will be harmless...""). This type of error can slightly confuse readers, as it disrupts the flow and clarity of the argument. It's vital to pay close attention to pronoun usage to enhance clarity.

Your vocabulary usage indicates a solid foundation in English. However, further improvement in vocabulary will be beneficial.

There is no evidence of the public opinion basis of the discussion due to the general nature of the presentation, represening only a personal point of view of the writer. The appropriate format is to use the third person pronouns when discussing the first 2 public opinions, to show that you are ""discussing both views"" only. This seperation is clear when you notice that the original prompt refers to ""Some people"" and ""others"", indicating the need to discuss the public point of view first, the writer's opinion last. \n The personal opinion should be presented within a seperate 3rd paragraph to show a clear comparison analysis using first person pronouns. The differentiation of points of views through pronoun use is necessary for the TA + GRA scoring considerations.","Your essay offers a thoughtful perspective on whether children should leave their homes in adulthood or stay with their families to develop their careers. Let's dive into how you can enhance your essay across several key areas.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   - It is essential to closely align your introduction with the prompt. While your introduction creatively sets the stage by discussing the impact of modernization on family structures, it slightly diverts from the prompt's focus. Ensure that your introductory statement directly addresses the topic by restating the prompt using different words without introducing new ideas that might shift the original meaning.

2. **Clarity and Presentation of Arguments:**
   - Your thesis statement is clear and presents your viewpoint effectively. However, when discussing the various perspectives on the topic, remember to distinguish between the general public opinion and your own. Initially, discuss the broader views in an objective manner using third-person pronouns to make it clear you're summarizing others' opinions. Your personal stance should be distinctively outlined, ideally in a separate paragraph, to create a more structured and coherent analysis. This method showcases your ability to evaluate different viewpoints before presenting your conclusion.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   - Your essay demonstrates a good command of language, though there are instances where simpler language could enhance clarity and readability. Remember, complex vocabulary and structures are beneficial when they serve your argument, but clarity should always be your priority. For example, phrases like ""unprecedented metamorphoses"" might be simplified to ""major changes."" This adjustment ensures that your points are easily accessible to all readers.

4. **Support for Your Arguments:**
   - You've included some supportive arguments and evidence, such as statistics regarding adults living independently, which is commendable. However, to strengthen your position further, ensure that each argument is clearly linked to your thesis and explored in depth. For example, when mentioning the survey about adults living on their own, elaborate on how this supports the idea that staying with family is beneficial for career development.
   
5. **Consistency in Point of View:**
   - Your essay occasionally shifts in perspective, which can confuse readers. Maintain a consistent narrative voice throughout your essay. When discussing public opinions, use a neutral, third-person perspective, and reserve the first-person perspective for expressing your own viewpoint. This clear differentiation not only improves the flow of your essay but also aligns with the expectations for English proficiency exams.

In conclusion, your essay provides a compelling argument for why young people should stay at home to further their careers. By enhancing the structure of your arguments, aligning more closely with the prompt, maintaining a consistent point of view, simplifying language for clarity, and providing more detailed supporting evidence, you can significantly improve the effectiveness and persuasiveness of your essay.

Which are considered as the most remarkable?,"In this information technology era, there is an increasing number of transport revolutions, but from my perspective, trains are considered the most remarkable transportation innovation over the past 2 centuries. The reasons of the statement will be discussed in this essay. \n First of all, trains have become dramatically convenient to carry goods and people due to the large capacity and the reasonable price. To begin with, since horse-drawn carriages and cars seemed to lack space for freights and passengers, trains have sprung up to ease the problem. Thus, instead of bringing merely several people or under a ton of goods before, now a train is capable of carrying hundreds of passengers and tons of freights involved. Additionally, the cost of a train ticket is reasonably priced, which is much cheaper than that of other vehicles in terms of long-distance traveling. By this way, entrepreneurs are likely to save more financial funds for goods' carriage leading to economic growth. \n Furthermore, the transportation may help to minimize the rate of traffic jams and decrease the time for traveling. In fact, the world population has increased rapidly, so train might be the key to an efficient way to reduce traffic jams' proportion. Specifically, the fewer people are using individual vehicles, the more road space there will be, resulting in reducing congestions risks. On the other hand, it is much faster for commuters to travel by trains. To make this point clear, through the history of upgrading steamed engine to electric engine, the speed of trains has been improved significantly, which is recorded at over 500 kilometers per hour at the present. \n In conclusion, I strongly believe that the innovation of trains is of paramount importance because of its beneficial impacts on human beings.","Do, there is an error in your discussion. Since you are referring to transport innovation and not cargo transport innovation, you cannot discuss the train in the cargo transport manner. That is because cargo trucks are used for the commercial transport of goods. The trucks are far more efficient and capable than the train. Granted that the train was the preferred mode of transport in the late 19th to early 20th century, that is no longer the case these days. Cargo planes and trucks have taken over that role in the commercial transport industry. So that reason is wrong and weakened your discussion. \n Your discussion about trains being an efficient alternative of mass transport is strong though and makes sense. Your samples and reasoning is sound except in the part where you said ""On the other hand..."". That phrase should have been omitted so that the sentence would have been more authoritative and supportive of the previous sentence. \n You also failed to consider that not all rail transport systems in the world as modern as you imply in your essay. Other countries that are not capable of modern train transport systems suffer in comparison and thus, negate your opinion that the train is the most significant transportation innovation over the past 200 years. The airplane or cargo trucks would have made more sense in this discussion. \n To strengthen an essay like this one, you need to pre-empt questions and possible counter arguments from those who have a different idea. Think of the opposition reasons I gave above and how you might have incorporated a defense statement in your essay paragraphs to weaken my arguments. That is called a pre-emptive discussion and often strengthens opinion essays that ask about topics as the one you indicated here.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by presenting a clear stance on why trains are considered an exceptional transportation innovation over the past two centuries. In terms of structure and focus, the point of view is consistently maintained throughout, providing a solid framework for the arguments presented. However, there are several areas where the essay can be improved to strengthen its argumentation and overall effectiveness.

1. **Accuracy and Scope of Argument**: While the essay presents trains as a revolutionary mode of transportation, especially for cargo and passenger movement, it’s important to acknowledge the complexities of transportation innovation. The discussion around the efficiency of trains in cargo transport could be misleading since, in contemporary contexts, cargo trucks and planes have largely taken on this role due to their flexibility and efficiency. Addressing the competition from these modes of transport and contrasting them effectively with trains would provide a more balanced view and strengthen your position.

2. **Support and Reasoning**: The argument that trains offer an efficient alternative for mass transport and help reduce traffic jams is compelling and well-supported. However, the reasoning could be deepened by addressing variations in rail transport modernity across different countries. Not all countries benefit from advanced rail systems, and acknowledging this could offer a more nuanced view of the trains' impact globally. This consideration would also help anticipate and counteract opposing viewpoints, making the argument more robust.

3. **Coherence and Style**: The use of phrases like ""On the other hand"" was pointed out as potentially weakening the argument's flow. Ensuring that transitions between ideas are seamless and reinforcing rather than undermining previous statements would improve the essay's readability and persuasive power. Direct, confident assertions tend to have a stronger impact.

4. **Pre-emptive Discussion**: A powerful strategy to enhance your essay is to anticipate counter-arguments and address them within your writing. By considering possible opposition to your views and incorporating defenses against them, your essay would not only demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic but also show critical thinking skills by engaging with differing perspectives in a meaningful way.

5. **Spelling and Grammar**: The essay demonstrates good control over language but would benefit from a careful review for minor spelling and grammar errors to ensure clarity and professionalism.

Overall, the essay is on the right track with a clear thesis and relevant arguments. By expanding the scope of discussion to include contrasting viewpoints, addressing the global variability of train system advancement, and refining coherence and style, the essay could significantly increase its persuasive power and effectiveness.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

The student must learn to identify the difference between comparison and single opinion discussion prompts to successfully develop relevant responses.","This essay explores the impacts of technology on work and study environments, highlighting concerns such as efficiency and social interactions. While the effort to address these issues is commendable, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make the argument more persuasive and relevant to the given topic.

1. **Relevance to the Topic:** The essay attempts to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using technology for work and study but seems to slightly miss the mark of the assigned task. The essay should focus more on expressing how these aspects pose a negative development rather than comparing pros and cons. For example, instead of balancing both sides, concentrate on explaining why these technological adaptations could lead to negative outcomes.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are noticeable spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. To enhance clarity and readability:
   - Pay attention to punctuation, especially the use of commas and periods, to avoid run-on sentences. 
   - Be cautious with spacing after punctuation marks.
   - Consider using simpler sentences to express ideas more clearly.
   - Review the use of articles (""a"", ""the"") and plurals to match the subject.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your position is somewhat clear as you lean towards the disadvantages of technology in work and study settings. However, making a definitive statement at the beginning can help clarify your stance from the start. Remember, the essay should directly state that these technological changes represent a negative development, focusing solely on the drawbacks.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your arguments revolve around the lack of efficiency and potential distractions technology might cause, along with its impact on social relationships. However, the essay could benefit from focusing on specific, explicit reasons such as the lack of social interaction and the burden of additional expenses that these scenarios might incur. Avoid including comparisons or discussing advantages to maintain the focus on explaining why these are negative developments.

**Additional Suggestions:**
- Ensure that each paragraph clearly presents one main idea, supporting it with examples or explanations.
- To strengthen your argument, you could include credible sources or hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the negative impacts more vividly.
- Avoid generalizations by providing specific instances or data that support your points.
- Finally, conclude your essay by summarizing the negative impacts discussed, reinforcing why technology in work and study environments is seen as a negative development.

By addressing these areas, the essay can become more coherent, focused, and compelling, making a stronger case for the negative impacts of technology on work and study environments.",3,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

However, that the government is investing too much money in the arts is the widely held opinion. Those who think that the funding of the arts fields could be used for other purposes are greatly mistaken. \n Art consists of seven forms and they are always present in our daily life, such as cinema, music, painting, theater, literature. One cannot deny that they are different types of entertainment that cannot be missing in society. By going to the cinema, listening to music, people can relax after many stressful hours of work with only a small amount of money. With these simple ways to relax, we can better focus on our work, which leads to greater efficiency. In addition, the profit, for example, from the music and film industry, is not a small amount and this also contributes to the development of the economy. \n Moreover, some people were not born to be a scientist or an engineer. Their mind is full of emotions and art is the way they can express themselves. Investing in art is the encouragement for them to develop their appropriate skills. Furthermore, introverts, who do not often show their feeling, may sympathize with the messages of a song or a book, which helps them express their thoughts better so they can interact well with other people. \n Taking these points into considerations, I would like to emphasize that, the arts prove their advantages not only in the economy but also in the social life of human. The investment in this sector is absolutely not a waste of money and it should be balanced with the funds for science, technology or healthcare. \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","Your response to the prompt question is incorrect. As you can see below: \n OQ: To what extent do you agree with this view? \n Response: Those who think that the funding of the arts fields could be used for other purposes are greatly mistaken. \n The question is in relation to your agreement or disagreement with the given opinion (I strongly agree, partially agree, greatly disagree, totally disagree). It not related to the issue of whether the opinion is correct or incorrect. As such, the essay clearly shows that you misunderstood the prompt for the discussion and as such, strayed from the given discussion instruction. So, your response format is now incorrect, thus ensuring that your TA score will start under a failing score. Once the TA score is failing, it is near impossible to reverse the failing score trend in the essay. This singular error could result in a totally failed overall score due to other errors present in your written presentation.","Your essay on the importance of arts funding presents several compelling arguments why this investment is valuable both economically and socially. However, there are areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, relevance, and adherence to the prompt. Understanding and directly responding to the essay prompt is critical. The original question asks for the degree of agreement or disagreement with a viewpoint, but your response positions the argument as correct or incorrect. This divergence from the question's intent affects the relevance of your essay to the given topic. It's important to directly state your level of agreement or disagreement with the statement to stay aligned with the essay's prompt.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic concerns, the essay is generally well-written but could benefit from minor refinements. For instance, ensuring consistency in verb tenses and maintaining subject-verb agreement will strengthen your presentation. Additionally, varying sentence structures can enhance the readability and flow of your essay. 

The point of view is relatively clear throughout the essay; you've articulated a strong case for the value of art in society and the economy. Ensuring that your introductory paragraph directly addresses the essay prompt by stating your position (agree or disagree) will further clarify your viewpoint.

Your arguments in support of arts funding are compelling but could be enriched with more detailed examples and data. For instance, mentioning specific ways in which arts contribute to the economy or social well-being, with statistics or studies to back up these claims, can make your position more persuasive. Furthermore, while the types of art and their societal benefits are mentioned, expanding on how these lead to economic benefits would make your argument more comprehensive.

In summary, while your essay provides a thoughtful perspective on the value of arts funding, focusing on directly responding to the essay prompt, refining grammar and style, clarifying your viewpoint from the beginning, and bolstering your arguments with specific examples and evidence will significantly improve your essay’s effectiveness.

However, should children always obey their parents' counsel? I find that ""yes"" can be the answer in just some situations. \n Firstly, the consultation of parents is always worth considering. Parents are grown-ups, who have lots of experiences in life and they usually know what is legal or illegal, ethical or unethical? Parents educate children with love. They give advices because they think that is the best choice for their daughters or sons. Thinking about these advices gives children an opportunity to reevaluate their decisions before action. For example, a child without experiences can find that gamble is so interesting; however, a wise and caring father may give his little boy a persuasive warning to stop the child from doing wrong things. \n In another side, parents' advices are not right in all cases. For example, a boy can not obey the arrangement of his father about his love as well as his career. If he has an amazing voice and desires to be a singer, the father should not stop him and force him to be a dentist. Building fence between a person and his passion can make him unfortunate and regret. \n Therefore, how could we find a resolution whenever parents and their children have disagreement? The answer is ""conservation and persuasion"". Parents convince their daughters/sons by sufficient evidence such as laws, the story of their own or their acquaintances. Children persuade their parents by the talent, some small achievements they achieved in contests, some express of sincere love as well as passion, some good characters of their lovers. Then the family together choose the best thing to do. \n In conclusion, children and their parents should usually have conversations to find what a child had better do. If the advices of parents are not reasonable, it will be necessary for a child to convince their parents. In other cases, talking the parents' advices is a good choice.","Hang, what type of essay are you writing exactly?

Even without that information though, I have some comments for you to consider. The first of which is with regards to your opening statement. By opening the paragraph with the phrase ""In fact,"" that indicates that you offered a series of sentences prior to that which connect with this new information being presented.

Avoid rhetorical presentations because these tend to make the writer deviate from the original topic or, you simply do not have the space within which to properly respond to the self imposed questions. These will be another set of reasons why you will receive points deductions, regardless of the exam type.","The essay opens with a discussion on whether children should always obey their parents, which is a relevant and engaging topic. However, there are areas for improvement to make the essay stronger and more coherent.

Firstly, the introduction of the essay could be enhanced. Instead of beginning with ""In fact,"" which suggests that prior information was discussed, it would be beneficial to start with a clear opening statement that sets up the conversation. For example, directly addressing the question of whether children should always obey their parents' advice would provide a clearer entry into the essay's theme. This change would help avoid confusion and immediately engage the reader with the key question.

The essay poses some rhetorical questions, such as ""who have lots of experiences in life and they usually know what is legal or illegal, ethical or unethical?"" Rhetorical questions can engage readers, but here, they may distract from the main points. Instead of posing questions without direct answers, it might be more effective to state the information outright. This approach would ensure that the arguments are straightforward and easy to follow, which is particularly important for English language learner students.

There are several spelling, grammar, and style issues that could be addressed. For instance, the use of ""advices"" should be corrected to ""advice,"" which is uncountable in English. Also, phrases like ""In another side,"" could be better expressed as ""On the other hand,"" to improve the flow and coherence of the essay.

The clarity of the author's point of view could be enhanced by providing more balanced arguments. While the essay discusses the value of parental advice and the importance of children making their own decisions, consolidating these viewpoints with clear, concise examples would strengthen the argument. For example, rather than using hypothetical scenarios, drawing on realistic and relatable examples could make the argument more persuasive.

Lastly, the conclusion brings the discussion to an end by suggesting that children and parents should communicate to make decisions together. However, it could be more impactful by summarizing the key points discussed and providing a strong, definitive stance on the issue. This would leave the reader with a clear understanding of the author's viewpoint.

Improving these areas will make the essay more engaging, coherent, and effective in communicating its message. The focus should be on clear, direct statements, proper grammar and style, and the effective use of examples to support the argument.",3,4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, there are several areas where improvements would enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your essay.

1. Response to the Topic:
Your essay touches on both sides of the argument but seems to lean more towards discussing the topic from two opposing viewpoints rather than focusing on supporting one clear stance throughout, as would be expected. To improve, decide on a single viewpoint and consistently support it throughout your essay. This will make your argument stronger and more coherent.

2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:
- At the beginning of your essay, choose between ""First and foremost"" and ""On the one hand"". Using both is unclear and may confuse the reader. Picking one phrase will help in presenting your ideas more clearly.
- Be consistent with tense and voice to ensure the essay flows well. For example, you switch between past and present tense (""has been currently dominating""), which can be confusing.
- Consider simplifying complex sentences to make them more understandable. For instance, ""strength and time can be saved effectively and more convenient for citizens"" could be rephrased to ""people can save time and energy, making their lives more convenient.""
- Avoid repetition of ideas and phrases to keep the reader engaged.

3. Clarity of the Author's Point of View:
Your essay initially suggests a balanced view but lacks a clear, singular perspective as advised. To make your position clear from the beginning, explicitly state your main argument in the introduction and reinforce it in the conclusion.

4. Arguments and Support:
- Your arguments often lack specific examples or detailed explanations. When making a point, try to include real-world examples, statistics, or studies to back up your claims.
- When you mention the negatives of remote work and education, such as isolation or distraction, providing more detailed consequences or studies could strengthen your argument.

Additional Suggestions:
- Work on structuring your essay with clear and distinct paragraphs for introduction, body (with arguments), and conclusion. This helps in logically organizing your thoughts and making your essay easier to follow.
- Pay attention to the coherence of your essay. Make sure each sentence and paragraph smoothly transitions to the next with appropriate linking words or phrases.

What are the songs you often listen to?,"A nineteenth-century poet once noted that ""Music is the universal language of mankind"". Throughout the high and low notes of human history, this has undoubtedly been true for me. According to various studies and reports, music can really change our tune. So in this speech, we're gonna have a more direct look at music and its influence on reality through a particular song. \n As an introverted girl from Generation Z, I am into music that is delicate and smooth while still being trendy and modern. I discovered that the pop ballad was an ideal suit for me. One of my favorite tracks recently is ""First Man,"" which was performed by Camila Cabello. The titular figure of the song is actually an allusion to her father, for he is ""the first man that really loved"" her. The storyline of the song reads like the singer was about to spend her first night staying with her lover. And this has her dad worried. So she spends an amount of time trying to ease his worry about the relationship she was in. And this is an emotional moment for both her and her dad. \n The song's lyrics effectively convey the father's care for his daughter. Even though the daughter is on the verge of becoming mature, the father still looks out for her, even if it's the simplest. The only man who is always willing to sacrifice for us unconditionally is our father. I have read somewhere that ""A father's tears and fears are unseen, his love is not directly expressed, but his care and protection remain as a pillar of strength throughout our lives."" Yet, because of this, we tend to forget this silent affection. We are just concerned with our phones, friends, current entertaining events, etc. The distance gap between us and our father becomes bigger and bigger. As a result, I believe we should show our father more love, gratitude, and care in our daily actions: ask if he is tired after work,... We are typically able to say ""love"" directly to our partner, but we are embarrassed to do so with our parents, particularly our father. However, you know what even just a simple direct love-showed word from us can also sound like music to them. Last year, I participated in a personal development course that included a final activity in which I had to express my love to my father directly. He cried somewhat when I simply said ""I love you"" to him; it was the first time I had seen his tears. That partly shows how happy our father will be to hear such words from us. Hence, just start doing it; it may seem awkward at first, but it will become a wonderful habit over time.","<quotation>A nineteenth-century poet once noted</quotation> \n In order for this quotation to be effective in your speech, you need to provide the actual name of the person you are citing.

Knowing who said it adds credibility and interest for your readers. Try beginning with your personal views or experiences instead to catch the reader's attention right from the start.

The use of informal language such as ""we're gonna"" is not appropriate for an essay. Essays, even when they are speeches, should use formal language. This shows you can use English effectively in an academic setting. Instead of ""gonna,"" use ""going to.""

In mentioning your favorite song, you don't need to specify ""recently."" If the song is still popular, just mention it by name. This keeps your essay focused and avoids unnecessary time references which might confuse your audience or seem irrelevant.

Avoid using abbreviations like ""etc."" in your writing. Such shortcuts can make your essay seem informal and are not suitable for an academic essay. It's better to be clear and specific or to list examples fully to improve the quality of your writing.

Your essay does a good job of explaining the personal impact of the song ""First Man"" by Camila Cabello and its emotional connection to father-daughter relationships. However, the argument could be strengthened by focusing more on how the song's narrative supports your thesis that music influences reality. 

Your point of view is clear; you believe music, particularly certain songs, can profoundly affect our perceptions and relationships. This is a strong position, but providing more examples or evidence from the song or other research studies on music's psychological effects would make your argument more persuasive.

Also, consider discussing how this personal insight relates to a broader audience. How can everyone relate to the feeling you've described? Offering a broader perspective can increase the impact of your essay.

Remember, clarity and correctness in language use are crucial. Avoid slang and informal language, and aim for precise and academic language. This will not only improve your essay's readability but also demonstrate your English proficiency.

Lastly, when sharing personal experiences like the one about expressing love to your father, ensure the narrative supports your main argument effectively. This personal story is moving and relates well to your topic. To enhance your essay, tie it back to the broader implications of music's role in human emotions and relationships more explicitly.

By addressing these points, your essay will become more academically rigorous, engaging, and persuasive. Keep practicing your formal writing and exploring the meaningful connections between music and life.",4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,Argumentative
4577,https://essayforum.com/writing/enough-students-choose-science-subjects-94937/,dev,Not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. Why? Effects on society,"In contemporary world, some countries have witnessed a shortage of students opting for science curriculum in colleges. There are two principal reasons resulting in this phenomenon, and it would have some notable impacts on society. \n The first cause which discourages youngsters from enrolling in science subjects is low earning potential. In some countries, workers working for science fields would be not only controlled by the government, but they also receive salaries from it, which are not high as from private or multinational corporations. For example, according to the survey in 2021, some Vietnam's scientists researching agriculture or forest gained a monthly amount of 10 million Vietnamese Dong, which was insufficient to meet all basic demands in their lives. Secondly, some education systems produce ineffective outcomes. To be precise, exam-driven curriculum in some states does not provide learners with hands-on experiences, which deprives them of several opportunities to apply for high-profile organizations or lets them face confusion at work. \n Regarding significant impacts, firstly, this tendency leads to a strong reduction of beneficial initiatives satisfying the population's needs. For instance, if the authorities make a decision on create viable solutions to deal with consequences of climate change, this could be impossible to be undertaken due to a lack of qualified scientists who refuse the government's low financial investment. The second impact is the administration's weakened credibility in society. For example, civilians tend to believe in science field of other countries because their universities attract a high number of outstanding students over the world. Thereby, they would consume science's products produced by those countries rather than their ones. \n In conclusion, low income and inappropriate university course prevent a large number of students from accessing to science subjects in several nations. Consequently, this leads to a shortage of qualified employees in those countries, and lessen their credibility in society.","<quotation>There are two principal reasons resulting in this phenomenon, and it would have some notable impacts on society.</quotation> \n This is an empty thesis statement. There is no basis for this discussion presentation. What reasons relate to this discussion? Why do you think that the reasons are valid? Where is the short form discussion? Your opinion is not clearly established so the examiner will have no way of scoring the clarity of your topic understanding and writing instruction compliance. \n Avoid overwriting in your response. You are needlessly extending the explanations for no reason. With a 40 minute writing time, you should be getting to the point in every sentence immediately as opposed to stretching the explanation, which just wastes the time of the examiner, who will not give you additional vocabulary scores anyway since the GRA of your essay is far lower than it should be due to the over worded presentation.","The essay responds to the topic by addressing the reasons behind the shortage of students choosing science curriculums in colleges and its impacts on society. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to make the essay more effective and clear.

Firstly, the thesis statement lacks specificity and depth. It's crucial to clearly state the main reasons and potential impacts discussed in the essay right from the beginning. This gives the reader an immediate understanding of the essay's focus and the position being argued. To improve, try to briefly summarize the key points that will be explored in the essay within the thesis statement itself.

There is a tendency in the essay to provide explanations that are overly complex and lengthy. While detailed discussion is valuable, every sentence should aim to contribute directly to your argument or point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration. This will make the essay more concise and focused, allowing for a stronger, clearer presentation of ideas. Strive to make your points directly and use examples effectively without adding excessive description.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and style, it's important to review the essay for minor errors and to ensure that it follows a coherent structure. Pay attention to article usage (""In contemporary world"" should be ""In the contemporary world"") and agreement between subjects and verbs. To improve the readability and professional look of your essay, consider revisiting sentence structure for variety and clarity.

The point of view in the essay is relatively clear but could be strengthened with a more assertive voice and by clearly stating your opinion and analysis of the issues discussed. Make sure each paragraph clearly supports your overall argument with specific examples and explanations.

Finally, while the essay provides a general discussion of the reasons students may avoid science subjects and the potential societal impacts, it could benefit from clearer and more descriptive arguments. For instance, when discussing low earning potential and ineffective education systems, incorporate more direct analysis of how exactly these issues deter students, supported by concise examples or data. Similarly, when exploring the impacts, directly connect these back to your initial argument to reinforce the importance of addressing the root causes you have identified.

By addressing these areas, the essay can achieve greater clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness, providing a compelling discussion of the chosen topic.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

From children to adults, everyone likes sport. This kind of enjoyment can be demonstrated in many ways, such as: watching a football match, playing badminton with friends every weekend, etc. Due to the popularity of many sports, a lot of athletes are known in many places. Especially, for children, these athletes play an important role in setting good models to them. Not every athlete is good nor bad model. \n Many children like playing sports. When they truly enjoy any kind of sport, they will spend time for it, including professional athletes playing that sport. A professional athlete will be a best ever model for them to learn to. A good athlete will teach them how to play well during the match, show them skills needed to have, etc. The knowledge an athlete gives will help children improve their personal skill in the kind of sport they engage in. Besides, not only show them how to play well, a good athlete can be seen as a good example of trying hard to achieve goals in life. Children will never be afraid of difficulties or give up due to any challenge, they keep going to like their favorite athlete. \n However, professional athletes are not always good role model. There're many athletes have bad behavior during and after the match. Children who see or read about their behavior can misunderstanding of the purpose of sport. Especially, many athlete use drugs to improve their performance, so the children will think being the best without consideration, even breaking the rule can be accepted. Moreover, bad behavior of athlete can lead to bad behavior in children. They can easily get angry just because of losing any match, fighting with other player or even cheating. \n Sport play an important role in children' lives so as athletes. Professional athlete should consider their behavior before acting because not only they're in trouble after a wrong one.","The first 3 sentences of the restatement paragraph are only filler sentences that do not relate to the actual topic. You need to use sentences that will actually help focus the reader on the target discussion. That is, whether or not athletes are good role models. Something along the lines of: \n <em>Athletes are considered by most young people as their role models. Young men and women tend to follow the actions of their sports idols with much eagerness, often patterning their lives after that of exemplary sportsperson. The way I see it, good or bad, sports icons remain examples for their fans. As a cautionary tale, the young adults their errors serve as a good life lesson for their fans. As a positive role model, the young people will know how to properly live their lives based on the actions of the athletes.</em> \n This is not a comparison essay. The original prompt asks you to choose which opinion regarding athletes you feel is correct, giving you the option to discuss and support your opinion within 2 clear reasoning paragraphs. Both paragraphs need to clearly explain a reason why you believe they are positive role models, or negative, depending upon your opinion. \n Do not use a comparison discussion in a single opinion essay. You will be scored down in the TA section due to a lack of clear opinion.","This essay aims to discuss whether athletes are good role models for children, a relevant and engaging topic. The essay does touch on important points regarding the influence of athletes on young people. However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance the clarity and impact of the discussion.

1. **Topic Relevance and Structure**: The opening sentences need to be more focused on the essay's main argument – the role of athletes as models for children. Instead of broad statements about the popularity of sports, it would be beneficial to directly address the influence of athletes on young people from the beginning. A more targeted introduction would set a clear direction for the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor errors in spelling, grammar, and word choice that disrupt the flow and clarity of the essay. For instance, it's ""not every athlete is a good or bad model"" instead of ""not every athlete is good nor bad model."" Attention to detail in proofreading can greatly improve the readability.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay attempts to discuss both the positive and negative aspects of athletes as role models but does not state a clear opinion on which perspective it supports. For a stronger essay, decide whether you believe athletes are generally good or bad role models for children and focus your argument around that opinion. This clarity will make your position more compelling and easier for the reader to follow.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay mentions both positive and negative behaviors of athletes and their potential impact on children, the discussion lacks depth. Each point raised would benefit from specific examples or more detailed explanations. For instance, when mentioning athletes who use drugs, explain how this could negatively influence children's perceptions of fairness and hard work. Likewise, highlighting a specific positive example, such as an athlete's philanthropic efforts, could effectively illustrate the potential for athletes to be good role models.

By focusing more directly on the question of athletes as role models, clearly stating a personal stance, ensuring linguistic accuracy, and providing well-supported arguments, the essay can become a robust and persuasive piece of writing. Remember, every point made should directly contribute to building a case for your opinion, using both specific examples and a clear, coherent structure.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

There are many different kinds of people around the world. Some are friendly and some are confident. However, it is very hard to look for someone that we can identify as a good person. In my opinion, there are several personalities of people, but two important qualities are being faithful and being kind. \n One of the greatest qualities a good person need is being faithful. First and foremost, a trustworthy person is someone we can count on no matter what. For example, a good person is a person with whom you can talk to and trust with your secrets, they won't open their mouth just for fun of it because they respect you. Furthermore, a trustworthy person will never lie to each other. Another point of being a faithful person is responsible. For instance, as a responsible member of the family, they will take care of whenever they go far away will always worry for the family members. Namely, with a friend relationship, a good person will never penny wise pound foolish, keep a promise, Apologize when you've made a mistake. \n Being a kind person is another necessary quality of a good person. Firstly, a good person is someone who has a warm heart. For instance, he or she will give love to people around by they share their couple with virtuous and kind actions such as doing charity, donate money to poor people or taking care of old people in care homes. Moreover, becoming a volunteer can help community life is improved by aiding others and helping hands like joining green summer program. Secondly, caring for each other is a way to build a good character too.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** While the essay demonstrates proficiency in English, there are grammatical errors and stylistic choices that should be revisited. For instance, consistent tense usage and the correct use of articles ('a', 'the') can greatly improve the readability of the essay.

Additionally, some ideas could be developed more fully to provide a deeper understanding, such as explaining what it means to be responsible or how volunteering can impact community life.

To improve the essay:
- Pay close attention to grammar and punctuation to ensure the message is clearly conveyed.
- Make sure examples are directly linked to the qualities being discussed, and elaborate on these examples to show a deeper understanding of the traits.

These scores will not just be passing ones since the writer did not meet the minimum writing standard for the task. \n While the topic may be considered a controversy, it would be best to avoid making such exaggerated references in these types of discussions since the writer is expected to restate a direct opinion alone. A direct representation avoids the pitfalls of overexplaining the tast in the restatement. Another problem with this paragraph is the lack of direct response to the discussion instructions.

However, there are several areas that need improvement to align more closely with essay writing standards for English proficiency tests.

Firstly, the essay is under the recommended word count. A minimum of 250 words is generally expected, and the current length falls short. Expanding the essay to meet or exceed this count is crucial to avoid automatic deductions or failing scores. More content can be added by deepening the discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of edible insects, providing more examples, or introducing additional points of view.

Regarding the essay's structure and clarity, the introduction makes a broad statement about overpopulation but does not direct the reader to a clear thesis statement or opinion. Instead of stating that the topic is controversial, it would be more effective to clearly outline your stance on the issue right from the beginning. This sets a focused path for the essay and helps to avoid the ambiguity that currently detracts from the effectiveness of the argument. 

There are spelling and grammar issues, including the misuse of words such as ""regrading"" instead of presumably ""regarding,"" which impacts the perceived quality and clarity of the writing. It's vital to use words correctly to effectively convey your message; if unsure about a word's meaning, opt for a simpler term that you are confident about. This ensures that the message remains clear and accurate.

Additionally, the essay's arguments, while present, could benefit from clearer and more descriptive support. When discussing the advantages, more specific examples or data would strengthen the position. Similarly, for the disadvantages, expanding on why certain insects might be harmful to consume with more detailed explanations can enhance the argument's depth.

The concluding paragraph currently lacks the recommended substance. A more robust conclusion of at least 40 words and comprised of at least two sentences is needed to effectively summarize the essay’s main points and reaffirm the stance taken. This is an opportunity to reflect on the arguments made and leave the reader with a strong, lasting impression of your viewpoint.

In summary, focusing on expanding the content to meet the word count requirement, clearly stating your position on the issue, addressing spelling and grammar errors, and providing more detailed support for your arguments will significantly improve the quality of the essay.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity:**
You've responded to the topic by discussing both the advantages of air transport and its environmental drawbacks. Your viewpoint that technology can solve these environmental issues is clear, which aligns with the essay prompt asking for your opinion and reasons.

2. **Language and Style Issues:**
- **Spelling and Grammar:** There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""helicoptors"" should be ""helicopters,"" ""alot"" should be ""a lot,"" and ""comsume"" should be ""consume""). Grammatical errors also detract from the clarity of your essay. For instance, ""those problems we can solve it"" should be ""we can solve those problems.""
- **Punctuation and Apostrophes:** Be mindful of when to use apostrophes. They are used to indicate possession (e.g., ""the airplane's safety"") and contractions (e.g., ""it's"" for ""it is""), but not for plurals (e.g., ""airplanes"" not ""airplane's"" when speaking about more than one airplane).
- **Word Usage:** Ensure you are using words correctly. As mentioned, ""a lot"" is two words, not one. Also, consider the accuracy of word choice to enhance your essay's readability and professionalism.

3. **Supporting Arguments:**
While the essay presents advantages of air transport, such as speed, service quality, and safety, it's crucial to ensure that all the paragraphs support your main argument. Discussing air transport's safety does not directly support your thesis about technology solving environmental problems. It would strengthen your essay to focus all arguments on how technology can or will address these environmental concerns.

4. **Development of Ideas:**
Your essay would benefit from more detailed examples and explanations. For instance, when mentioning the development of electric transportation, providing examples of advancements in electric vehicles and drawing parallels to potential developments in air transport would make your argument stronger and more persuasive.

5. **Conclusion:**
Your conclusion revisits your main idea but could be more impactful by summarizing how technology not only has the potential to solve the environmental issues brought by air transport but is also part of an ongoing trend toward more sustainable practices worldwide.

In addition, the homeowner does not clearly mentioned about the detail of the sold homes, such as its location, area, size, etc of two homes. \n Finally, the argument implies that the bigger amount and working time of Adams' employees make it a superior firm.

When the leaders understand the way to drive their companies in an effective and efficient way, there is no need of copious workers. Moreover, there is no clear information about the qualities and competencies between those two company's agents. \n So, the difficulty with the argument, as presented above, is that it makes several unwarranted assumptions. For that reason, the conclusion does not follow logically from the permises.","Dear student, I think that the highest this essay can score is a 3 based on several reasons. The first is that although you present the reasons why the discussion is flawed, your reasoning is not strong enough to support your argument. For example you said: \n <quotation>There is a possibilty that Adams charges being much more than those on Fitch's.</quotation> \n - What charges are these? Since Fitch and Adams are real estate companies, there ar eno manufacturing costs on their part since they are selling RFO or ready for occupancy homes. The homes are already built by someone else. They are just selling it. \n <quotation>Adams has more agents so it could cost more in employer's salary.</quotation> \n - You based your assumption upon what reason? Remember, the best way to argue this is by presenting your own knowledge of the discussion topic. Since the agents work on commission aside from a salary, you have not really convincingly discussed this issue. \n There are several other samples throughout the essay that show how your assessment of the data is incomplete. Remember, in the GRE essay, you should be able to assume the opposing argument and argue against it through valid reasoning, assumptions, and practical evidence. In this instance, your discussion is just as weak as the original letter being presented.","Your essay presents an analysis questioning the superiority of Adams Realty over Fitch Realty by identifying three main assumptions. However, there are ways to strengthen your arguments and improve the clarity and effectiveness of your essay. Below is feedback focused on response to the topic, spelling, grammar, stylistic issues, clarity of viewpoint, and the quality of arguments.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
Your essay aligns with the given task by examining the assumptions within the homeowner's letter. But, to make your critique more potent, ensure you directly tackle the logical gaps in the homeowner's argument. Offering alternative explanations or presenting counter-evidence could enhance your response.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
Your essay is generally well-written, but you could improve its impact by polishing the grammar and style:
- Watch out for run-on sentences and ensure your ideas are clearly separated for better reader comprehension.
- Be cautious with the use of possessive apostrophes (e.g., ""Adams'"" vs. ""Adams’s"" depending on intended meaning).
- Refine your word choice for clarity and precision, and audit your text for any spelling errors.
  
3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:**
Your stance, that the original argument is flawed due to unreliable assumptions, is clear. However, articulating your reasoning more thoroughly could strengthen your position. Instead of stating assumptions, dissect them by questioning the homeowner's rationale and offering logical counterpoints.

4. **Arguments and Evidence:**
While you correctly identify weaknesses in the original argument, your critique occasionally lacks depth. Here are specific suggestions to improve:
- When discussing Adams's potential higher charges or costs due to more agents, clarify your understanding of real estate operations. Agents often earn through commissions, not just salaries, impacting the company's overall expenses differently.
- Address the comparison of selling times between Adams and Fitch by incorporating knowledge about market trends or other factors that could influence these durations, apart from merely the number of agents.
- Expand upon the implication that a greater number of agents automatically positions Adams as superior. Consider exploring the quality of service, efficiency, customer satisfaction, or agent expertise as alternative measures of a real estate firm’s performance.

**Enhancing your Essay:**
- Integrate practical evidence or hypothetical examples to support your arguments better.
- Discuss the implications if your questioning of the assumptions proves correct; how would that reshape the argument's conclusion?
- Simplify the language to ensure your arguments are accessible and understandable to a broader audience, especially given this is intended for English language learners.

In summary, fortify your essay by clarifying your criticisms with more precise language, deeper analysis, and by offering concrete evidence or scenarios that challenge the initial claims effectively. Your essay takes important steps in critical analysis, and with these adjustments, your arguments could be presented more convincingly and impactfully.",3,4,3,4,4,3,2,4,3,1,Argumentative

However, there is still a school of thought that it will be better regardless of modern technology. While this may be true to some extent, I am leaning towards the far-fetching benefits of leveraging technology advancements. \n It is irrefutable that the permeating of technology lead to social isolation. Nowadays, the young generations are more inclined towards advanced technology due to its fundamental facilities like surfing, doing chit-chat via social platforms. Hence the severe outcomes are the heavy reliance on it and refraining from social communications. However, this thinking is flawed. Thanks to technological innovations, we could work remotely and maintain the business operations in the pandemic outbreak of Covid 19 when most countries have to implement the strict lockdown. \n In addition, another profound merit is that technological breakthroughs have revolutionized the way humans work. Recently, cutting-edge technology is utilized in the daunting tasks that previously required a copious amount of time, labor, and resources. For example, a shoe manufactory needs ten workers to produce 100 hand-craft shoes a day, but now only a particular machine could upgrade its productivity more than twice. This shift generates significant savings in labor costs and contributes to the unprecedented increase in the net profits for the operations. \n In conclusion, the superior advantage of technological invention outweighs its drawbacks. I perceive that we should take advantage of it to foster the development of our society in the foreseeable future.","<quotation>While this may be true to some extent, I am leaning towards the far-fetching benefits of leveraging technology advancements.</quotation> \n The discussion question is, ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?"" not, ""Is the statement somewhat true and why?""

However, there are several areas where improvements could strengthen your argument and align your essay more closely with the expected response to the essay prompt. Let's dive into specific feedback points to guide you in refining your essay:

1. **Prompt Response and Thesis Statement:** It seems that the essay slightly misses the mark in directly responding to the given prompt. The task asks to what extent you agree or disagree with a certain view on technology. A clearer stance expressed in the beginning, specifically stating the extent of your agreement or disagreement, would align better with the prompt. After stating your stance, it's important to include a thesis statement that outlines the main reasons supporting your view. This adjustment will make your position and the structure of your essay evident from the start.

2. **Relevance of Arguments:** Your essay primarily discusses technology's influence on work and manufacturing. While these are valid points, they don't fully address the prompt's focus on technology's impact on people's lifestyles. It would be beneficial to expand your argument to include how technology affects daily living, social interactions, and personal well-being. This broader approach will ensure that your arguments are directly relevant to the topic.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are a few minor spelling and grammatical errors in your essay. For instance, ""It is irrefutable that the permeating of technology lead to social isolation"" could be revised for clarity and correctness to ""It is irrefutable that the permeation of technology leads to social isolation."" Paying attention to verb tense and subject-verb agreement can greatly improve the readability of your essay. Additionally, strive for varied and accurate vocabulary to enhance the sophistication of your writing.

4. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your viewpoint on the benefits of technology is clear but could be strengthened by directly addressing the essay prompt at the beginning and maintaining focus on that perspective throughout your essay. This will help in keeping your argument coherent and impactful.

5. **Supporting Arguments:** While you provide examples and reasons to support your positive view on technology, incorporating more detailed examples, especially those related to the everyday lifestyle of people, would make your argument more compelling and pertinent. You could include examples related to social networking, online learning, and digital healthcare to illustrate technology's diverse benefits more fully.

In conclusion, revisiting your initial response to the prompt and ensuring your essay directly addresses the topic will make your argument stronger. Focusing your reasoning on the lifestyle impacts of technology, refining your grammar and language use, and clearly outlining and supporting your viewpoint will significantly enhance the effectiveness and coherence of your essay. Making these adjustments will not only better align your essay with the requirements but also enrich its overall quality and persuasiveness.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay initiation lacks a clear paraphrasing of the given topic, which is crucial for setting the context of the discussion. It is important to clearly restate the topic in your own words and directly address the task at hand. This includes making your stance clear from the beginning and immediately outlining the reasons for your position, which was missing in the initial presentation.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are noticeable issues with spelling, grammar, and style throughout the essay.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The essay's point of view seems to shift and is not consistently clear. While discussing an issue like taking a gap year, it's essential to firmly maintain your position throughout the essay. Giving mixed signals to the reader can make the argument confusing.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence:** The essay does introduce some arguments and examples, such as the benefits of traveling for gaining practical skills. However, these arguments need to be more clearly defined and directly linked to how they support your viewpoint. Providing more detailed and concrete examples can help strengthen your position.

5. **Essay Structure and Conclusion:** The structure of the essay could be improved by separating advantages and disadvantages more clearly and discussing them in individual paragraphs. Additionally, the conclusion should neatly summarize the main points discussed without introducing new information or personal opinions unless the task specifically asks for it. The goal of the conclusion is to reinforce your stance clearly and concisely, which was not fully achieved.

Consider both sides of this debate and present your own opinion. \n esssy: \n Whether to have a year to rest after high schools continues to be a controversial topic, and there are valid reasons on both sides. I will discuss it as follows. \n One the one hand, the supporters of a gap year before university may think that students should be given time to think in-depth about their lives through the real world. Their explanations may as follows. For one thing, it is widely agrees that a majority of youngsters have no specific idea about their future. In this case, they may get into trouble when they need to choose the majors that they will study for, which is considered to be an important decisions in people's life. However, spending time in voluntary work and other social activities may help them find their missions and the aim of university education. For another, they can broaden their horizons by experiencing different cultures, job positions, etc. by a variety of activities during the period of time. \n On the other hand, some parents points out the time wasting and safety issues if their children are encouraged to have a one-year free time after high schools and it might be the reasons why they are against the gap year. Evidence has shown that a large number of pupils may stay at home, playing computer games instead of stepping of their comfort zone to experience something new, which may led to the waste of their precious time in early adulthood. Furthermore, those young people who are not circumspect enough are possible to meet some problems such as robbery, drug addiction and so on, which threatens their lives. \n In summary, from my perspectives, even though there are some concerns about gap year, the benefits of it still outweigh the disadvantages considering the positive impacts on young people.

However, there are several areas that need improvement to make the essay clearer and more effective.

1. **Structure**: The essay would benefit from a more organized structure. Typically, a balanced discussion like this is best laid out in five paragraphs: an introduction, one paragraph for each viewpoint, a third paragraph presenting your own opinion, and a conclusion. This structure helps maintain clarity and ensures that all parts of the debate are presented logically.

2. **Clarity of Opinion**: It’s important to distinctly separate your opinion from the discussion of the two sides. Your opinion should have its own paragraph, where it is clearly stated and supported by reasons. This separation ensures your perspective is understood and not lost amidst the other arguments.

3. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should not introduce new information. Instead, it should summarize the points discussed and reiterate the stance you've taken. This recap helps reinforce your argument and provides a clear ending to the essay.

4. **Word Choice and Grammar**: Be mindful of singular and plural forms; for example, ""perspective"" refers to your single view, not ""perspectives"" unless you are discussing multiple viewpoints of different people. Additionally, avoid using abbreviations like ""etc."" in academic writing. It is more appropriate to either fully list out your points or conclude the list with a statement that indicates the presence of more examples.

5. **Detail and Support**: While providing examples is good, it is equally important to explain why these examples are relevant and how they support your position. Aim to give a strong example followed by detailed justification, rather than listing many examples with little explanation. This depth of analysis will make your argument more convincing and your essay more insightful.

6. **Focus on the Task**: Ensure that you fully respond to the essay question, considering both sides of the argument before presenting and justifying your own view. This comprehensive approach shows your ability to engage critically with the topic.

In the past, the young in a family usually work in the same city and live closely due to the bad traffic. However, the children in a family now generally go to different cities to get better life quality when they study and work, which causes them to have few opportunities to go back home and stay with their parents. Besides, the mobile phones appear. Nowadays almost everyone has a smart phone with many attractive and interesting applications on it. Many people often use the phone to watch videos and play games all the day instead of talking with their family. Sometimes even two people in one room just play on their own phones without any communication. \n So what will this situation cause? In my opinion, it will cause the conflict between the family members. The less time people use with their family, the worse the relationship between them is. It may cause the quarrel and cold violence even a fighting in the family. \n In conclusion, there are plenty of bad consequences caused by this trend.

However, to elevate the quality of the essay and ensure it meets the criteria for a proficiency test, several improvements are needed. 

First, it's essential to expand the essay. The given text is below the typical word count expected for such assignments, which suggests an underdeveloped discussion. A more detailed examination of the topic could better support your points and demonstrate a thorough understanding of the subject.

A major challenge in the essay is its direct referencing to the original topic without rephrasing or expanding on the initial ideas. It's imperative to showcase original thinking by not only restating the prompt but also by building upon it with unique insights and a personalized viewpoint. Incorporating different perspectives or additional reasons for the trend discussed could enhance the depth of the analysis.

The argument structure, particularly in expressing reasons for the trend and its consequences, needs more depth. The current presentation seems oversimplified. Delving deeper into how exactly lifestyle changes and technology contribute to declining family time, perhaps by including statistics, studies, or comparative analysis, would strengthen the argument. Moreover, exploring a wider array of implications this trend might have on family relationships could enrich the content.

Regarding style, there are minor grammatical errors and some stylistic choices that could be improved for clarity and flow. For example, phrases like ""the style of life changes"" could be rephrased to ""lifestyles have changed."" Additionally, the essay would benefit from smoother transitions between ideas to help guide the reader through your argument seamlessly.

To clarify the author's point of view, ensure that each paragraph conveys a distinct part of the argument, supported by clear and descriptive statements. The conclusion could be more impactful by not only summarizing the negative consequences of the trend but also by suggesting methods or solutions to counteract these issues.

In summary, the essay addresses the topic but needs significant development in word count, depth of argumentation, clarity of the author's viewpoint, and grammatical accuracy.

In this essay I will discuss them, including the idea of how life span extension sounds appealing to senior citizens and the painful truth of living a longer life. Overall, I think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. \n On the one hand, increasing life expectancy is advantageous to a certain extent. First, it offers people opportunities to fulfill their wishes and obligations. Following retirement, the amount of pension received and spare time available can be made use of in order to make one's incomplete dreams come true, especially for those who are too occupied with workload in their earlier lifetime to travel to their favorite countries and keep a pet around their houses, for instance. Second, enjoying a longer life may induce a sensation of happiness. This is because elderly people have a tendency to show preference over observing the maturation of their offspring and grandchildren, which brings about nostalgia. \n On the other hand, the plus side of longevity appears to be just an illusion in reality. It is undeniable that the older humans become, the more likely they are to suffer from critical health disorders, so for most elderly people, special medical assistance is vital. Consequently, despite having an abundance of time, they may be stuck in bed due to a lack of physical conditioning which is a stumbling block to obtaining their intentions. What is more, it is currently a tendency for the young generation to send their parents into nursery homes because they cannot ensure enough time and effort for their children, let alone the elderly. This means the poor grandparents rarely have a chance to participate in raising the grandchildren, but resort to being surrounded by other old friends for the rest of their lives. \n In summary, weighing up both sides of the argument, I would say that although increasing life expectancy does have some desirable effects, including pursuing unfulfilled dreams and enjoying more happy moments with younger generations, the actual possible scenarios of diminished health conditions and tedious life in nursery homes more than justifies having it.","Why is the essay discussing centuries of long life?

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   Your essay attempts to delve into the pros and cons of longevity. However, the introduction slightly misinterprets the scope by suggesting a historical perspective (""for centuries""), which is beyond the task's requirements. The discussion should be more focused on current implications and personal interpretations relevant to today's context, ensuring alignment with the topic.

2. **Language and Style:**
   While your essay is rich in language and presents ideas in an advanced manner, it's crucial to balance elaborate expressions with clear and direct statements that accurately convey your arguments. Ensure the use of complex vocabulary doesn't obscure the clarity of your points. Aim for precision in your language to make your essay more accessible and straightforward.

3. **Clarity of Viewpoint:**
   Your viewpoint appears towards the end of the introduction, which is a good practice. However, ensure that your conclusion effectively summarizes the arguments presented without introducing new ideas or relying solely on personal opinion. The conclusion should serve as a cohesive recap, reinforcing your stance based on the discussed advantages and disadvantages.

4. **Argumentation and Support:**
   You've outlined both advantages (fulfilling wishes, experiencing happiness from family growth) and disadvantages (health issues, isolation in nursing homes). These arguments are well-thought-out; yet, providing more specific examples and evidence would strengthen your stance. When discussing disadvantages, for example, integrating statistics or findings from reputable sources about health deterioration could add weight to your argument.

To improve:
- Refine the focus of your essay by explicitly stating current perspectives on increased life expectancy, rather than suggesting it has been a topic of interest for centuries.
- Simplify and clarify your language to ensure ideas are presented accurately and are understandable to all readers.
- Ensure your conclusion succinctly summaries the presented arguments without veering into new discussions or relying overly on a personal opinion that hasn't been thoroughly argued throughout the essay.
- Augment your arguments with specific examples or evidence where possible, to enhance the persuasiveness of your stance.

As a history fanatic, I suppose this place is for cultural and historical education. Therefore, I believe that asking for a charge here could bring more harm than good. \n Understandably, museums need financial support to be fully operational. Businesses usually acknowledge that without a sufficient fund, they would not be able to pay for the renovation, preservation of expensive artefacts or just the employees working there. It is also true that many a time visitors come in groups, they tend to make noise, which can be disruptive to others inside. Because of this, a substantial amount of available budget might be shared for security services, and admission fee might supply that sum of money. \n However, this should not be prioritized over the importance that museum attaches to the society. Firstly, it could be discouraging for low-income families to pay the required fee for entrance, and their children might not have access to witnessing history at hand, which might have helped for their education. This further raises the issue related to educational inequality. Moreover, it should be realized that taxpayers money can also suffice for the operation of museums. Later on, this amount can allow businesses to afford and enhance their security services, thus render museums more attractive and pleasing to visitors. \n In conclusion, I am convinced that charging for entry to museum is more detrimental than beneficial. In other words, if admission is free of charge, it could somehow bridge the educational disparity. Even though museums might be cut off from a source of financial assistance, they can ask for funding from taxpayers and therefore, use it wisely to attract more visitors.","Never use words of uncertainty in a Task 2 test.

1. **Precision in Opinion**: It's crucial to express a clear and definitive stance on the topic from the beginning.

It's essential to decide firmly on the view and articulate it without ambiguity throughout the essay.

2. **Coherence**: For a cohesive essay, it's advised to consistently support the initially stated opinion throughout. Mixing supportive arguments for and against the topic within the same essay can dilute the strength and coherence of the argument. It would be more effective to present arguments that solely bolster the initial standpoint, ensuring that every paragraph contributes to reinforcing that position.

3. **Supporting Arguments**: Avoid using a numerical order (""firstly"") without following through with a sequence for your arguments. It's more important to focus on the quality of reasons and their explanations rather than their order. Ensure each supporting argument directly relates to and strengthens your main opinion. Additionally, consistency in reasoning enhances clarity; fluctuating between viewpoints within the essay weakens the overall argument.

4. **Concluding Phrases**: Relying on common phrases such as ""In conclusion"" could be perceived as a lack of vocabulary range. Experimenting with various ways to introduce the conclusion, such as ""All things considered"" or ""To summarize my stance,"" could demonstrate a wider lexical resource and make the closing remarks more interesting.

By focusing on a clear, unwavering opinion from the outset, maintaining consistency in supporting that opinion, and utilizing a rich variety of vocabulary, the essay can achieve greater clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. These improvements will not only strengthen the argument but also enhance the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay.",3,3,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4590,https://essayforum.com/writing/computer-games-time-consuming-provide-78284/,dev,Computer games are time consuming and they do not provide educational value,"When it comes to the topic of computer games, people tend to develop various viewpoints. Some would contend that computer games are time consuming, whereas others would hold that computer games bring about significant benefits for children. Personally, I find myself in the same place as the former opinion for the following reasons. \n First and foremost, computer games are time consuming. Undoubtedly, computer game is the primary reason why children nowadays prefer staying inside to going outside. The amount of time they spend playing games can be used for much more beneficial activitities. Instead of games, teenagers can go outdoor and play with their peers, learning much more about the outside world. Moreover, computer games create severe impacts on them. For instance, since children avoid spending time outdoor and doing athletic activities to be inert and lazy at home, the chances of obesity are much higher. In fact, the obesity rate in the world is now higher than ever before and it is still increasing day by day and obesity also contributes to other ailments such as heart diseased. In addition, playing computer games can lead to weak eyesight since they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore, children should not be allowed to play computer games. \n Secondly, computer games provide no educational value. Opponents of my point of view may claim that computer game is a source of entertainment for children after a stressful day at school and some may benefits them academically. Nevertheless, this is only true in one respect. It is undeniable that playing computer games makes children become more relaxed, but it does more harm than good. In fact, computer games can promote violence among these youngsters. For example, in order to appeal to youngsters, most computer games companies attempt to recreate violence. Some of the most popular games nowadays such as Call of Duty or Counter Strike are extremely violence, with vivid images of death, explosions and gunshots and as a result, children have the tendency to mimic those actions. Therefore, computer games negatively influence children. \n In conclusion, I find myself definitely agree with those who assert that children should not be allowed to play computer games. This is of their negative influence on children.","Dear student, Vu, listen, you did a good enough job on this essay to score a 3, in my opinion at least. There were a number of mistakes made in the development of the essay which led to the lower end score for your essay. The first problem, is that your opening paraphrase is not exactly accurate. While you did offer a proper discussion instruction at the end, you did not clearly depict the topic for discussion. That is the main reason your score had to be lowered. A more appropriate paraphrase for your essay is: \n <em>There is a discussion as to whether computer games as a form of entertainment are a trivial use of time for children. That is why youngsters should be prevented from participating in this activity. I agree with this opinion based on several reasons.</em> \n Your opening statement was not really a proper paraphrase of the original prompt because it does not follow the template of the original discussion. In the version that I wrote for you, the theme of the original prompt remained intact up to the presentation of the personal opinion at the end. \n Now, the prompt indicates that you have to discuss only one opinion for this essay. There is no option for a comparative analysis. As such, your presentation became faulty to a great extent. Even though you over discussed the opinions, you did not really develop a convincing explanation for any of them because you tried to discuss too much in one paragraph. A standard ruling for the essay response development is, do it within 5 sentences and focus on only 1 topic so that you can clearly explain yourself. That is how you increase your scoring chances in any English test. You must stick to only one discussion per paragraph. Since you have 3 body of paragraphs for the essay, you should use the paragraphs to present 3 solid and convincing evidence of your opinion. There is no need to present an opposing argument as it is not required by the prompt. \n The concluding statement is too short and limits your scoring considerations. Always write at least 3 sentences for a better scoring consideration. Just restate the prompt in a new manner, summarize the details of the discussion or topic sentences, then repeat you opinion at the end. Simple, but effective in increasing your score overall.","The essay explores the topic of computer games and their impact on children but does not accurately address the specific discussion point as required. The introduction could be improved by clearly stating the discussion topic, such as the debate over whether computer games are a trivial use of time that children should be prevented from engaging in. This clarification would provide a stronger foundation for the arguments that follow.

There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that need attention. For instance, ""computer game is the primary reason"" should be ""computer games are the primary reason,"" and ""activities"" was misspelled as ""activitities."" Also, phrases like ""extremely violence"" should be corrected to ""extremely violent."" These errors can distract readers and cloud the essay's messages. Simplifying language and structuring sentences more carefully can enhance clarity and readability.

The point of view is clear; the author believes children should not be allowed to play computer games due to their negative impacts. However, the essay would benefit from more in-depth and focused arguments supporting this viewpoint. Instead of covering too many ideas superficially, it would be more effective to explore a smaller number of points in greater detail. Specifically, presenting one main idea per paragraph and expanding on it with clear, supportive details could strengthen the argumentation.

The essay attempts to include arguments against computer games, claiming they are time-consuming, lack educational value, and can promote violence. While these points begin to outline the author's stance, they would be more persuasive with concrete examples, research findings, or statistics to back them up. For instance, discussing specific studies on the correlation between computer games and obesity or behavioral issues could lend credibility to the claims.

The conclusion of the essay is brief and could be expanded to more effectively reinforce the argument. A stronger conclusion would restate the core argument in a fresh way, summarize the key points made, and reiterate the author's position. This would help to leave a lasting impression on the reader and solidify the essay's stance on the issue.

Lastly, the essay does not require the presentation of opposing arguments since the prompt asks for a discussion of one viewpoint. Focusing on developing a compelling case for the chosen position without mentioning contrary opinions can provide a more coherent and persuasive response. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can significantly increase its effectiveness and achieve a higher score in proficiency assessments.",3,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

In this modernized era, nevertheless, approaching newspapers or books via technological devices is moderately ubiquitous due to the amenities it brings to us. \n To begin with, there is a myriad of benefits of reading books through gadgets. Firstly, the internet has a huge amount of books, which totally can overshadow the quantities in the bookstore close to your home. Many enormous firms began to convey books to devices, for instance the Kindle from Amazons. Secondly, there is no doubt that technology is developing with an overwhelming pace, even in many areas with miserable conditions of life. For that reason it can help the inhabitants in those areas, who cannot afford paperbacks, have opportunity to gain knowledge. \n On top of that, wood has been extremely exploited for paper for a long period of time, so this innovation will decrease substantially the number of treeless hills, and help many forests to recover. Besides, all books will be digitalized so the expenses of constructing bookstores will no longer be extant. People can also save time because they will not have to go to the bookstores anymore. \n To sum up, reading books online will give more chances to enrich knowledge for any hierachies in society, save the world from deforestation and reduce large amounts of money. For these reasons, digital books will dominate traditional ones in the near future.","The original prompt for this essay requires an extent response.

As such, the overall essay response / discussion represents an unrelated discussion presentation. Since the essay does not follow the instructions provided in the original, the response cannot be properly judged. It does not represent the required scoring requirements.","The essay needs to be more closely aligned with the given topic to fully address the task. The original assignment was to discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement that in the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they can read everything online without paying. The essay, however, frames the discussion differently, focusing on the general benefits of digital over printed media without directly engaging with the assertion about future trends in media consumption and payment for content. 

To improve, it's important to ensure that the essay directly responds to the prompt. Start by clearly stating your position on the given statement at the beginning of the essay. Are you agreeing or disagreeing? To what extent? Then, throughout your essay, make sure to refer back to the original statement to ensure that your arguments are relevant.

Regarding spelling, grammar, or stylistic issues, here are specific points that need attention:
- The use of the plural ""newspapers"" instead of ""newspaper"" and ""Amazons"" instead of ""Amazon"" when referring to the company. Be mindful of proper nouns and their correct usage.
- Phrases like ""for a long period of time"" can be shortened to ""for a long time"" for brevity and clarity.
- Use “hierarchies” instead of “hierachies” to correct the spelling.
- Be careful with passive constructions and try to write in active voice when possible to make sentences stronger and more direct.
- Ensure subject-verb agreement and consider simplifying complex sentences to enhance readability.

The point of view is clear, as the essay argues in favor of digital media; however, make sure it directly addresses the essay prompt's specific claim and reasons. 

In terms of providing support for the argument:
- It's commendable that a variety of reasons are presented, such as accessibility and environmental benefits. However, it would further strengthen the essay to include more detailed examples, statistics, or studies that support these claims.
- Also, consider addressing potential counter-arguments to show a well-rounded understanding of the topic. For example, discuss why some might prefer printed media and how digital media addresses those preferences or challenges.

To conclude, focus on directly answering the essay’s prompt, addressing any grammar and spelling issues, ensuring clarity in your arguments, and providing concrete evidence to support your viewpoint. This will make your essay more persuasive and coherent.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4592,https://essayforum.com/writing/recent-years-lot-readers-choosing-read-books-79265/,dev,"In recent years, a lot of readers are choosing to read e-books and not the regular books.","Over the last few years, the number of EBook consumers has dramatically increased, falling the paper book market. Due to the more sophisticated and interactive facilities, many people choose EBooks over the printed books. I believe that this trend has more benefits than drawbacks. \n Firstly, it is true that there are potential drawbacks of the E-Reading. The primary concern that many readers have with this trend is the Health problems; Since the EBooks only support for the digital platforms such as mobiles and computers, readers have to spend significant time in front of the LCD screens that can potentially cause health problems such as vision problems, and depression. Therefore, constant reading of E-books can result in health damages. \n However, despite the health issues, the advent of the Electronic books contributed several advantages to the Readers. Prior to the EBooks, readers had to waste too much time to find the required book by searching through the numerous bookshelves at the library. Sometimes it was impossible to purchase the book due to the high demand and lack of copies. The E-Book, however, has changed this completely. There are several EBooks downloadable websites and apps available such as Kindler and eBay, So, Consumers can quickly locate the required Ebook from online stores and immediately purchase without any shipment delays. Therefore, availability wise, consuming Ebooks are more convenient than the paper books. \n In addition to the availability, the highly-interactive features also make it more popular among the readers and publishers. While the traditional Paper books only support for text and image forms to represent the content, Ebooks allow rendering the content in several multimedia forms such as images, videos, audios, and Hyperlinks. For instance, If a reader wants to explore more about the topic, he can just click on the hyperlink and navigate to the additional information rather than wasting time to find out the appendix and relevant other books. So, it goes without saying that EBooks act more collectively to present the data to their audience. \n In conclusion, increasing usage of the E-books has reduced the paper books consumption. There are some disadvantages of this trend regarding the health concern of the readers. But nevertheless, the interactive features and more availability make it stand out from the paper books; thus I argue that the advantages of the Ebooks far outweigh than the demerits it has.","thilini, it is nice to know that you are cognizant of your errors in writing. That shows due diligence on your part and ability to take constructive criticism in order to improve your skills. The reason your essay ran longer than necessary is simple, it is supposed to be a single opinion essay but you chose to discuss both points of view. A move that was totally unnecessary and irrelevant to the discussion. Unless the prompt specifically states that you have to ""discuss both points of view along with your opinion"", all IELTS opinion essays are single point of view based. Only the opinion you support needs to be discussed, justified, and strengthened within the 3 body paragraphs. In this instance you were asked if you thought the advantages of the ebook outweighed its disadvantages, so there is only one point of view to be discussed, the advantage portion. The essay would have been immensely shortened if you had properly understood the prompt and responded accordingly. Remember, all opinion essays require only one point of view discussion unless otherwise specified.","The essay effectively addresses the topic, examining the impact and discussing both benefits and drawbacks of the rise in eBook consumers versus traditional paper book readers. This demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter. However, it's essential to focus primarily on the argument that the essay intends to support. As the task is to argue whether the advantages of eBooks outweigh the disadvantages, maintaining a focus on this perspective throughout would strengthen the essay. Discussing opposing viewpoints, while insightful, can divert the essay from its main objective unless the prompt explicitly requests such a discussion.

There are several spelling and grammatical errors, as well as stylistic issues throughout the essay that need attention. For instance, ""falling the paper book market"" could be more accurately expressed as ""leading to a decline in the paper book market."" Similarly, ""the health problems"" should not have a capitalized ""Health."" Proper nouns like ""EBook,"" ""E-Reading,"" and websites or applications such as ""Kindler"" and ""eBay"" (correct spelling) require consistent capitalization. Also, avoid unnecessary capitalization in general terms such as ""readers,"" ""consumers,"" etc. Moreover, the mention of ""eBay"" as an eBook platform seems incorrect, as eBay is more widely recognized as an online marketplace for a variety of goods rather than a dedicated eBook source. It might be beneficial to reference a more accurate example, such as Amazon or Google Books.

The point of view is clear in the essay, with a stance that the advantages of eBooks outweigh the disadvantages. However, clarity could be improved by more explicitly stating this position in both the introduction and the conclusion to ensure that the essay's purpose is clear from the beginning. 

The essay provides descriptive arguments supporting the advantages of eBooks, such as their convenience and interactive features. Yet, these points could be strengthened by addressing the counterarguments more succinctly, focusing on refuting them directly related to the posed advantages, rather than presenting them as equal sides of a debate. Direct comparisons highlighting why the advantages significantly surpass the disadvantages could offer more compelling and focused support for the essay’s thesis.

In conclusion, concentrating on reinforcing the thesis with clear, well-supported arguments, refining the essay's focus according to the prompt's requirements, and correcting spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues would significantly improve the effectiveness and coherence of the essay.

While there are some undeniable reasons for this perception, I personally believe that education is more than just employability. \n On the one hand, the study of the past - History has proved to provide students with a great deal of advantages. Not only it acknowledge them with what happened in the past such as the rise and fall of an empire, the evaluation of human beings and so on, this academic area also gives an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the traditions and cultures of their own regions and countries around the world, which is a valuable factor to build well-rounded citizens that can become a useful part of future society. Moreover, mastering History gives young learners the sense of pride and passion for their local people and hometown, hence enhancing their patriotism. For example, when studying about the French's invasion in Vietnam, students will have the awareness and self-defense to protect the country against intruders. \n On the other hand, the role of learning Science and Technology is undeniable, especially in this day of rapid advancement. Global industrialism requires the people living in it a profound knowledge of technological consciousness. Cutting-edge technology remarkably promotes an advancing life, which increases a country's economic as well as societal status. For example, a focus on teaching Technology in the education system of Japan noticeably alleviated the consequence of its economic crisis in the early 90s. In addition, if one sees education as laying foundations for future employment, then of course subjects that link to more positive job outcomes should be priorities. \n In conclusion, the comparative importance of History, Science and Technology as part of modern education absolutely rely on the point of view of each individual. A balance is needed to make sure our society is populated by neither unemployable masses nor individuals that are disconnected from their own cultural identities.","Where did the reference to employability come from?

However, there are areas that could be enhanced to make your argument more compelling and aligned with the essay topic.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay indirectly responds to the topic by comparing the value of history with science and technology education. Yet, inserting the theme of employability seems to diverge from the direct comparison the prompt likely intended. Stick closely to the original topic to maintain focus and relevance throughout your essay. Avoid introducing new themes not directly linked to the topic, as this can confuse the reader.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Overall, your essay is well-written, but it could benefit from varied sentence structures and transitions. Phrases like ""on the one hand"" and ""on the other hand"" are helpful but try using a variety of transitions to begin your arguments. This adds sophistication to your writing. Pay attention to minor grammatical errors and ensure that every sentence contributes to your argument.

3. **Author's Point of View:** Your point of view is clear and predominantly personal. While personal opinions strengthen an essay, incorporating a wider range of perspectives would enrich your argument. Discuss public opinions or common beliefs regarding the value of History versus Science and Technology. This will give your essay a deeper comparative analysis and make your argument more robust.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position:** You've provided some descriptive arguments and examples, such as the impact of teaching Technology in Japan. However, more evidence and reasoning would enhance your argument. Explain not just what the benefits of studying history are, but why these benefits are significant. Similarly, when discussing science and tech, try to link these subjects to tangible societal improvements beyond economic crises. Mentioning how these subjects affect individuals and societies can make your argument more persuasive.

To improve your essay:
- Ensure your essay closely aligns with the topic and avoid introducing unrelated themes.
- Use a variety of sentence structures and transition phrases for a more engaging style.
- Incorporate a broader range of perspectives to support your viewpoint, including public opinions.
- Provide more detailed evidence and reasons to back up your claims, making your argument stronger and more convincing.

However, the response to the specific prompt given is not clearly articulated. Essays for these tests require a direct response to a given statement. Start by clearly stating whether you agree or disagree with the prompt in your opening paragraph, which should include your thesis statement. This not only sets the stage for your arguments but also aligns your essay with the required format.

2. **Structure and Format**: English proficiency tests often require a structured approach to essay writing. Your essay should ideally be organized into 3-5 paragraphs, each consisting of 3-5 sentences. This structure typically includes an opening paragraph with a clear thesis statement, 2-3 body paragraphs each presenting a distinct reason or argument supporting your viewpoint, followed by a concluding paragraph that summarizes your main points. Your current format does not meet these criteria. Developing complete paragraphs that elaborate on your main ideas will significantly enhance your essay.

3. **Clarity and Development of Arguments**: While your essay hints at interesting ideas, your arguments need to be more developed and clearly linked to your thesis. Use examples, reasoning, and analysis to support each point you make. For instance, when mentioning how inventions come from observing nature, expand on this with more examples and explain how this supports your main argument about the evolution of possessions leading to dissatisfaction.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: Your essay has some grammatical and stylistic issues that hinder its clarity and professional tone. For example, ""Ever since of discovering own property people are tend to be more individual,"" could be improved to ""Ever since discovering personal property, individuals have tended to become more independent."" Pay attention to verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure to convey your ideas more clearly. Consider revising sentences that are unclear or grammatically incorrect.

5. **Point of View and Cohesion**: Make sure your point of view is consistently clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph should connect smoothly to the next, with transitional phrases guiding the reader through your argument. Concluding each body paragraph by linking back to your thesis statement can help maintain a clear and cohesive point of view.

Overall, your essay has the potential to convey a unique and thoughtful perspective. By focusing on structuring your essay according to the guidelines, developing your arguments with clear and concise language, and addressing the prompt directly with a well-stated opinion, you can significantly improve your writing for English proficiency tests.

However, there are several areas where improvements could enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, it's crucial to address the way sentences and ideas are structured throughout the essay. The essay occasionally suffers from run-on sentences and overly complicated phrasing, which can confuse readers. To avoid this, consider breaking down ideas into shorter, more manageable sentences. A useful strategy is to outline your essay using individual sentences for each point you wish to make, then combine them into paragraphs. Aim for no more than five sentences per paragraph, each contributing clearly to the topic under discussion. This approach not only helps manage word count but also improves the readability of your essay.

Additionally, there are some spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, ""advantagous"" should be spelled as ""advantageous"", and ""indispensible"" should be ""indispensable"". Paying closer attention to spelling and grammar will significantly improve the professionalism of your essay.

The point of view is clear — you acknowledge the value of both pragmatic skills and academic knowledge without fully siding with one over the other. However, making your stance clearer earlier in the essay could help guide the reader through your argument more effectively.

While you present arguments supporting the importance of both skill sets, providing more detailed examples could strengthen your position. For instance, when discussing the necessity of specialization, more concrete illustrations of how specific academic knowledge applies in various job roles would be beneficial.

Lastly, regarding your concern about managing word counts under time constraints: A valuable technique is to draft your essay by first outlining your key points sentence by sentence, as mentioned earlier. This not only helps in managing the length of your essay but also ensures that each sentence is purposeful and directly contributes to your argument. After drafting, you can refine and combine these sentences into cohesive paragraphs, ensuring you stay within the desired word count.

This phenomenon is attributed to several causes, which can be tackled by a collective effort from both parents and educators. \n To begin with, there are numerous explanations for violent acts among schoolchildren. One of them may come down to their psychological deficiencies when brought up in dysfunctional families. Drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, among other factors, are believed to cause worry, hatred and resentment in small children, influencing them to act aggressively when interacting with classmates or teachers at school. Besides, social media is also to blame for this worrying trend among teenagers. At this early age, many have yet to develop a sense of right and wrong, which means overexposure to brutal content on online platforms would desensitize them to violence in the real world. For example, watching too many videos featuring gory fighting scenes on Youtube could easily make a child believe those acts to be normal occurrences, justifying some students not hesitant to resort to violence to settle disagreement. \n To curb this violence, parents and institutions can take several action. Firstly, it should be ensured that no social evils and disaccord exist within the households. If children are nurtured in a healthy environment, it is less likely that they will adopt violence as ways to resolve conflict. Besides, parents should monitor what their children view on social media so as to minimize the latter's exposure to harmful contents that fuel violent behaviors. Moreover, it is of importance that school leaders administer strict punishment on students displaying such acts. This would serve as a deterrent to repeat violators as well as would-be ones. \n To conclude, violence taking place in a school setting can stem from several reasons, including dysfunctional family dynamics and media consumption, which call for immediate action from the guardians as well as schools themselves.","<quotation>across the world</quotation> \n Unnecessary reference point.

It's evident that considerable thought has gone into understanding the various dimensions of this problem. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make arguments more compelling and the writing clearer.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay successfully addresses the topic by discussing the reasons behind school violence and suggesting preventive measures. Although using phrases like ""across the world"" attempts to establish a global context, it's more effective to focus on specific, relatable examples or evidence. Overgeneralizations or exaggerations can diminish the overall impact of the argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
The essay is generally well-written, but there are minor errors that need attention. For instance, ""several action"" should be corrected to ""several actions"" to maintain grammatical consistency. Being mindful of singular and plural forms can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of the essay. Additionally, consider simplifying complex sentences and reducing wordiness to enhance clarity.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
The essay clearly presents a point of view, identifying the family environment and media exposure as primary influences on school violence. While the stance is evident, strengthening the essay with more data or research findings could provide a solid foundation for the assertions made.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
The essay makes several important arguments about the causes and solutions for school violence. However, it's crucial to move beyond restating the problem towards offering more in-depth analysis and solutions. Avoid filler phrases that don't add value to the discussion, such as ""there are numerous explanations for violent acts among schoolchildren."" Instead, focus on elaborating on the points made with examples, evidence, or a deeper exploration of the causes and solutions. This approach will not only enrich the essay but also demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skills.

In conclusion, the essay makes a commendable effort to tackle a complex issue. By refining the argumentative structure, paying attention to grammatical details, and providing more detailed analyses and solutions, the essay can be significantly improved.

To make the essay stronger and more effective, consider the following points:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay should more directly address the specific question or statement provided in the topic. Ensure that the essay focuses on evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of the issue at hand, rather than presenting a general discussion.

2. **Grammar and Word Usage:** Pay attention to the agreement between subjects and their verbs or nouns. For instance, when discussing people moving, consider using ""cities"" instead of ""city"" to maintain consistency in number (plural vs. singular). This will enhance the accuracy and clarity of your statements.

3. **Clarity of Position:** It's essential to clearly state your viewpoint on the topic. For example, instead of saying ""In this essay I will going to prove my point,"" specify if you see the situation as an advantage or disadvantage. A clear stance will make your essay more focused and persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay mentions several interesting points, such as the opportunities for independence and learning, as well as the risks of negative influences. However, these arguments can be made more compelling with clearer and more specific examples. For instance, when mentioning students moving to Kathmandu, delve into how this experience explicitly aids in their growth or presents challenges.

5. **Cohesion and Coherence:** To make the essay more coherent, ensure that ideas flow logically from one paragraph to the next. Also, work on tying back each argument to the central thesis or the stated position at the outset, reinforcing how each point supports your overall view.

6. **Detailed Examples and Explanation:** Including more detailed examples can significantly strengthen the arguments. For instance, rather than stating that teenagers may be influenced by bad company, elaborating on how this happens and suggesting ways to mitigate such risks could provide a more nuanced perspective.

7. **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the main points but could be enhanced by clearly restating your position regarding the advantages and disadvantages, thereby reinforcing your viewpoint.

From my perspective, I totally agree with this statement. \n To begin with, what holds the most significant part is the government's authority to remain in our peaceful and protected life. The number of crimes would increase if there weren't any governance. For instant, according to New York Times, the robbery rates in Brazil decreased by 56 per cent after crime prevention was launched in 2000 by the politician. \n The improvement of the environment is also noteworthy in consideration due to the environmental rules. Obviously, when these stipulations were declared, people were likely to have enough awareness about our nature. Moreover, we find it easier to encourage civilians to go green. For example, as claimed by BBC News, the number of deforestation was reduced by 34 per cent in Russia in 1998 thanks to campaigns which prevented soil erosion. \n In conclusion, I strongly believe that our community should be based on the regulations which create limitations for individuals.","The prompt restatement totally messes the point.

He severely underwrote the essay at only 180/250 words. Since word count deductions will apply overall, the preliminary score will be failing.

He should have expanded on the discussion statements made rather than abruptly ending the paragraph, without additional explanations or justifications.He would have at least received partial scores for meeting the word requirement even if the discussion is irrelevant.","The essay provided offers a perspective on the necessity of societal regulations to maintain order and environmental protection. It is a good starting point to express opinions about the role of government and laws in daily life. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the structure, persuasiveness, and effectiveness of the essay.

**1. Addressing the Topic:**

Firstly, it is crucial to accurately respond to the prompt given. The essay strays somewhat from a clear restatement of the initial topic. Focusing specifically on the role of ""rule of law"" or how society balances freedom with order might make your argument stronger and more relevant. Ensure that your introduction clearly states your interpretation of the question and how you intend to address it.

**2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**

There are a few linguistic inaccuracies that detract from the overall clarity of the essay. For instance, phrases like ""civilians do not allow to do everything they want"" could be more accurately phrased as ""civilians are not allowed to do whatever they want."" Additionally, ""For instant"" should be corrected to ""For instance."" Attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and the correct usage of idiomatic expressions will make your writing more professional and easier to understand.

**3. Clarity of the Author's Perspective:**

Your point of view is stated, but it could be made clearer and more powerful with the help of specific, supporting arguments. Articulating why you hold your position, perhaps by exploring the consequences of a lack of regulation, could make your argument more compelling.

**4. Supporting Arguments:**

While examples related to crime rates and deforestation provide a basis for your argument, these points could be significantly expanded upon. Dive deeper into explaining why these examples are relevant and how they directly support your stance on the necessity of societal regulations. Developing your paragraphs with more detailed explanations, adding more examples, or elaborating on the implications of your examples will also help in meeting the minimum word count and making your argument more robust.

**5. Word Count:**

Your essay is shorter than the expected length. Expanding your discussion and including more detailed explanations can address this issue. This not only avoids potential penalties for underwriting but also allows you to explore your arguments more thoroughly, providing a richer and more engaging reading experience.

**Conclusion:**

Improving on these areas can elevate the quality of your essay significantly. Focus on accurately addressing the prompt, correcting linguistic errors, clarifying your argument, and providing detailed support for your viewpoints. By doing so, you will likely find your essays not only meet the requirements but also compellingly express your perspective.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, I partly agree with this former statement since both planting trees and housing play crucial roles in our daily lives. \n On the one hand, it is universally acknowledged that planting trees bring huge benefits to city dwellers. First, they give assistance to improve air quality, especially in metropolitan cities. With the advent of industry and technology, the environment is gradually contaminated by enormous amounts of CO2 emissions. Subsequently, trees play a pivotal role in absorbing those toxic fumes and releasing O2 that contributes to the improvement of air quality, which can reduce respiratory issues among people who live in cities. Furthermore, trees create shade and a peaceful atmosphere that enable citizens to take part in outside activities. Therefore, stress and other mental problems can be limited, leading to the fact that the living standard of city dwellers is increasing in the long term. A study conducted by Cambridge University students suggests that looking at the green of tree leaves for 30 minutes per day can significantly soothe one's mind and recharge their battery after a hectic working day. \n On the other hand, housing is believed to contribute greatly to the process of ensuring habitants' living standards. Initially, the increasing population poses a threat to the governments to solve the issue of affordable housing for citizens. Consequently, more trees have been cut down to make room for new houses with a view to meet the demand of city dwellers. For instance, in metropolises such as Beijing or Shanghai, housing comes out at the top due to the excessive number of people. Another justification is that without enough homes, people in such big cities are likely to be homeless, leading to a high crime rate that involves drug addiction or violence. This phenomenon could be detrimental to any countries' development; therefore, prioritizing housing can partly tackle this issue and ensure the quality of life for citizens. \n In conclusion, planting trees and building houses both have significant impacts on city dwellers. Governments and authorities should have feasible measures to strike a balance between these two factors so that the living standard of habitats will be improved in the future.","There are clear problem points in the opening restatement. The first problem is that the writer is exaggerating the statement from the original by using inflammatory words such as ""controversy"" and ""provokes heated debate"". Neither claim is referenced in the original so the restatement has become inaccurate. An idea was presented so, an idea should be restated. Second among the other problems of this essay are the use of the original reference topic \n <quotation>in open spaces in towns and cities rather than building houses</quotation> \n . The writer did not even try to restate the information in a different way. As such the restatement will fail due to the cut and paste / memorized reference. However, the miter provided a well established opinion + thesis statement. That reduced the amount of deductions in that paragraph. \n The next problem that will cause additional deductions is the inclusion of a solution in the summary conclusion. As there is no requirement indicated for such a statement, this will be seen as a prompt alteration and relevant discussion. This section must only contain a paraphrasing of previous discussion points.","The essay engages with an interesting topic: the balance between planting trees and building houses in urban areas. Your response outlines the advantages of both and suggests a need for a balanced approach, reflecting a clear understanding of the essay's topic. Nonetheless, there are several areas where improvements can be made for a better articulation of your ideas.

1. **Response to the Topic**:
Your essay directly responds to the prompt, presenting a balanced view on the importance of both planting trees and building housing in urban spaces. You've articulated a standpoint that both aspects are vital, which is good. However, the opening sentence could be improved by avoiding the use of exaggerated terms like ""controversy"" and ""provokes heated debate."" Strive for accuracy by maintaining the original presentation of the topic without adding intensity that isn't suggested in the prompt. Remember, an idea presented in the prompt should ideally be restated as an idea in your introduction.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:
Your essay is well-structured, with relatively few spelling or grammar issues. However, paying attention to sentence structure to avoid overly complex sentences can enhance clarity and readability. Additionally, be cautious with the use of terms and phrases directly from the original prompt or commonly known information without demonstrating a deep understanding or restatement in your own words.

3. **Author's Point of View**:
Your position is somewhat clear; you believe in a balanced approach to urban development. Nonetheless, reinforcing your point of view with more personal insight and a more robust discussion of your beliefs could strengthen your essay. It's crucial for your voice and reasoning to be distinct and compelling.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
You've provided good examples and reasoning to support your view, especially with the benefits of trees in urban areas and the necessity of housing due to increasing populations. The reference to a study by Cambridge University is effective in supporting your point about trees' mental health benefits. Ensure that any claims or references used in the essay are directly relevant and accurately presented to support your argument.

5. **Concluding Remarks**:
While your conclusion nicely summarizes the need for balance, including a solution or a new idea in the concluding paragraph is not necessary unless specifically prompted. The conclusion should focus more on summarizing your previous discussion points rather than introducing new solutions or ideas. This will keep your essay aligned with the prompt and avoid the appearance of altering the topic.

Overall, your essay demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the topic. By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can make your argumentation clearer and your writing more compelling.

Firstly, the introduction requires expansion. It is crucial to restate the topic more comprehensively before presenting the argument. Doing so not only shows understanding of the given question but also helps in organizing thoughts coherently. Each paragraph, including the opening and closing ones, should be composed of 3-5 sentences to meet standard essay requirements, ensuring a detailed argumentation and clear conclusion.

The point of view is expressed with conviction, which is a strength. However, clarifying and expanding on each argument with more descriptive examples would improve the essay's persuasiveness. When discussing the value of art in reflecting historical eras or contributing to the GDP, providing specific examples and elaborating on these points would make the argument stronger and more convincing.

Lastly, while the essay contains compelling arguments for government support of the arts, these would benefit from deeper analysis and stronger evidence. Mentioning the potential increase in GDP and cultural promotion is a good start, but further detail on how these processes work and their direct benefits to society could strengthen the case being made.

In conclusion, focusing on the expansion of the introduction and conclusion, rectifying spelling and grammatical errors, and further developing arguments with detailed examples and evidence will greatly improve this essay.

From my viewpoint, prison is just an instant solution while these other two methods may actively change their attitudes and release the financial burden of the whole society. \n Being isolated under strict supervision may trigger anger and anti-social attitudes. Nowadays, most countries around the world using prison as a special place to separate people who were accused of committing crimes from society for a specific time. This method is considered immediately effective by providing a sense of being safe for other people. However, it makes prisoners feel cornered in the desperation of having no chance to come back to normal life. Therefore, the inside anger will keep growing until they are legally released and burst out into criminal activities again. \n In contrast, education and vocational training bring long-term beneficial effects to both the prisoners themselves and society. Most criminals were born and brought up in poor conditions without the chance to access the education system. Being educated can help them perceive what is right and wrong more properly, as well as increase their understanding of laws. By then, there will be a change in their attitudes towards social vices and crimes. Besides, job training gives criminals more chances to rehabilitate, get employed to earn their livings. With fewer prisoners, the financial burden placed on the government for maintaining this punishment system will decrease. Instead, they can increase the investment in other essential areas such as social welfare, public health, etc. \n With the increase of criminal rates, the resolution to deal with this group of people is gaining more public attention.

The first paragraph is critical but lacks the direct opinion response required for a clear Task Achievement (TA) score. Always ensure to address the essay prompt directly for a stronger foundation in your essay.

Regarding the structure, the essay combines the benefits of education and vocational training into one discussion.

Discussing the benefits of education in one paragraph and the benefits of vocational training in another would allow for more detailed exploration of each topic, enhancing both the Task Achievement (TA) and Cohesion and Coherence (C+C) scores.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic with clear arguments supporting the potential positive impacts of education and vocational training on rehabilitation. However, it’s essential to develop each argument more fully to provide a stronger, evidence-backed assertion. This deeper analysis will also aid in addressing the prompt more thoroughly.

There are no significant spelling mistakes, but there are some areas where grammar and style could be improved for clarity and effectiveness. For example, consider simplifying complex sentences and ensuring subject-verb agreement throughout.

The first mistake that you made, was using the opening statement to address your opinion rather than building a proper introduction for the essay topic in the mind of the reader. The proper opening statement should have merely represented the topic for discussion, the 2 sides to be discussed, and an indication (not a statement) that your opinion will be discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. \n Your opinion must never be discussed as a part of the opening statement because that is always expected to be a properly developed prompt discussion within one of the paragraph bodies. This is normally discussed in the 4th paragraph, leading into the 5th paragraph or concluding statement. In addition to that, the conclusion is also wrong because you presented a new idea, that you did not accurately develop, as part of your closing statement. That is not allowed in academic writing.

However, there are several areas where improvements could help enhance your writing and better address the essay prompt.

1. **Introduction:** The opening of your essay directly states your opinion rather than introducing the topic and its two sides. A stronger introduction might briefly mention the general topic, hint at the complexities involved (both the positive and negative aspects), and suggest that you will explore these further. This approach sets the stage for your argument without immediately disclosing it, allowing your opinion to be more fully developed within the body paragraphs.

2. **Conclusion:** The conclusion introduces a new idea not fully explored in your essay. Academic writing typically requires that the conclusion summarizes the main points discussed, reinforcing your stance without adding new information. To strengthen your conclusion, focus on summarizing the arguments you've made, and reiterate the significance of these discussions in relation to your initial thesis.

3. **Spelling and Grammar:** There are several spelling and grammar errors throughout your essay which can distract from your message. For instance, ""miss-behavior"" should be ""misbehavior,"" and ""it positive and negative aspects"" should be ""its positive and negative aspects."" Paying close attention to spelling and grammatical accuracy is crucial as it reflects your English language proficiency and clarity of thought. Utilizing spell check tools or getting a peer review can help identify and correct these issues.

4. **Argument Development:** Your arguments concerning the disadvantages of fame are compelling; however, they could be further strengthened by offering more detailed examples and examining counterarguments. Addressing why someone might see fame as desirable, before refuting this with your evidence, could provide a more nuanced view and strengthen your position.

5. **Clarity and Coherence:** Ensuring that your ideas are well-organized and clearly expressed is key to a successful essay. At times, the essay could benefit from more transitional phrases to help the reader follow your argumentation more smoothly. Additionally, simplifying complex sentences can aid in maintaining clarity.

By focusing on these aspects, you can enhance your essay's effectiveness in addressing the prompt, demonstrating your language proficiency, and persuasively arguing your point of view.

As children pick up languages more easily than adolescents, and their brains are still developing to acquire their mother tongue, learning another language can facilitate the learning area of their brains and deepen their understanding of their native language. Besides, the introduction of a foreign language also brings along with culture and history. By teaching songs or telling stories in a foreign language, pupils can have imaginative sympathy and appreciation of foreign culture. \n However, the others concern that primary schools lack enough the educational profession in the second language. Another problem is the teaching style and its method. If children find it difficult or bored while learning another language and unable to receive proper assistance from teachers, learning foreign language early would still be not effective. Nevertheless, these issues can be improved by strategic policy. \n In my opinion, early exposure to foreign language benefits children economically and culturally in the future. The advantages are not only job prospects at home and broad but also the opportunities of communicating with and understanding about another culture in a more respectful way. As a result, young kids' capacity and knowledge should be cultivated to achieve these benefits. \n (254 words)","Dear student, the advice above has some applicable points to the IELTS test. While it is similar to the TOEFL test, the presentation is different in the sense that the TOEFL test asks you to immediately present your opinion at the start of the presentation. You do not have this advantage in the IELTS test. That is because the IELTS test is stricter in its paragraph formatting. The test does not allow the exam taker to immediately present a discussion due to the paragraph development requirements. \n As you can see, your essay failed immediately in the Task Accuracy section because, instead of presenting a paraphrased paragraph, you decided to discuss the topic instead. In the IELTS test, the opening paragraph should represent the following: \n 1. An accurate restatement of the topic \n 2. The discussion reasons presented \n 3. The discussion format instruction \n The basic paragraph format is normally 3-5 sentences, regardless of whether it is an opening statement, body of paragraph, or concluding presentation. Based upon the information in the opening paraphrase, you are looking at a minimum of 3 sentences. If you want to score well in the body of paragraphs, there are a number of things you have to ensure. \n In the body of paragraphs, make sure that you do not exceed the 5 sentence maximum presentation using one idea per paragraph as a topic, give a maximum of 2 supporting explanations in relation to the topic, then an example, close with a transition sentence into the next paragraph. \n When you are asked : <em>Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantage?</em> you need to pick one side to discuss in the essay instead of both. The instruction is clear, either it is advantageous or it is not. You cannot discuss both in the essay. All of the body paragraphs need to support only one side of the discussion as you believe it to be. \n Now, the reason that your essay will not pass the test is because you discussed only one side, which would have been acceptable, if you had done the discussion in the manner I instructed. Instead, you only focused on primary school, completely neglecting the secondary school point of view. Both points of view still need to be presented in the essay. If you had accurately discussed the opening paragraph, in a manner that allowed you to outline the discussion, you would have had a more concrete essay presentation. An example of a properly outlined opening statement is as follows: \n <em>Educational experts have been considering the proper age for youngsters to start training in the use of a different language other than their own. Some believe that this should be done as early as primary school while others offer the thought that perhaps secondary school learning would be best. The most common belief is that language learning should be started in primary school. I am of the opinion that learning the new language in primary school has more advantages than disadvantages. I shall present the reasons for my belief in the following paragraphs.</em> \n Then you could have kicked off the discussion with: \n <em>In my opinion, early exposure to foreign language benefits children economically and culturally in the future...</em> \n After which you could have said: \n <em>Those who oppose the idea believe that...<br/><br/>While those that support the idea indicate...<br/><br/>In the end, the reasons why....</em> \n These would have comprised a better formatted, outlined, and discussed essay on the topic.","Your essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the topic of when children should start learning a foreign language, showcasing both the benefits and potential challenges of introducing a foreign language in primary school. However, to improve your essay and align it more closely with the expectations of English proficiency tests such as the IELTS, consider the following points:

1. **Essay Structure and Task Response**: In the introduction, directly state the topic and your opinion. This will help readers understand your viewpoint from the beginning. You should begin with a clear restatement of the question, followed by a brief outline of your arguments, as English proficiency tests have specific requirements for essay structure, especially regarding how opinions and arguments are presented.

2. **Paragraph Format**: Aim for paragraphs that are concise and focused. Each paragraph should ideally follow a structure where you introduce a single idea, support it with a maximum of two explanations or examples, and conclude with a sentence that smoothly transitions to the next point. This ensures clarity and coherence in your essay, making your arguments easier to follow.

3. **Clarity in Argument**: While discussing the advantages and disadvantages, remember to pick a side and support it throughout the essay. English proficiency tests often require you to argue predominantly for one perspective. It's important to present both sides, but your personal stance should be clear and consistently supported by your arguments. This clarity will make your essay more persuasive.

4. **Specificity and Examples**: To strengthen your arguments, include specific examples or data to back up your points. This not only makes your essay more informative but also shows your ability to analyze and apply information related to the topic.

5. **Grammar and Style**: Watch out for minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. Ensure verb tenses are consistent, and sentence structures are varied to make your essay more engaging. Pay extra attention to avoiding overly complex words that might be misused, as clarity and accuracy are crucial.

6. **Conclusion**: Reinforce your stance in the conclusion by summarizing your main points. This will help solidify your argument and leave a lasting impression on the reader. Avoid introducing new information here; the conclusion is for reflection and summarization.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly enhance the quality of your essay. Keep practicing and pay attention to the structure and clarity of your arguments, and you will see improvement in your writing skills suitable for English proficiency tests.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

In this day, many people will do many kind things such as doing charity, releasing fish, eating vegetarian. I also like doing charity in this day. I tried to eat vegetarian one year ago. About releasing fish, I have not done this job yet. This is my plan in this year. I will invite my friend to join with this good activity. \n I want to talk about eating vegetarian. I think you heard many good things from eating vegetarian including it is good for your health. When you eat vegetarian with vegetable, fruit, cereals, you health is better. Your face can be more beautiful. When you eat less meat, your breath is fresh more, you hardly meet caries. I hear this from my teacher. \n To me, I still remembered I used to read book of Thich Nhat Hanh. He said that when we can eat vegetarian, we help our world. In this book said that every second, meat industry has made 43 thousands kilograms animals dung. It is more than 130 times all of human dung in the earth. When we want to make one kilogram of meat, people need to use 8 750 liters of waters. While, people want to make one kilogram wheat, people only need to use 87 liters of waters. \n When I read this paragraph, it makes me think again. And I changed.

There is a severe disconnect between the title, the focus of the early essay and the point of the last part of the presentation. It appears to me that you just wrote this essay as a simple English writing exercise. Therefore, I will advise you as to how to further improve your writing skills based on that assumption. \n Please be conscious of how to spell words. You need to consistently spell the keyword vegetarian properly. You misspelled the word once in this presentation. You also need to make sure that you properly refer to your readers in this essay. You have word choice errors in the presentation ( you= your). You also have problems with your noun phrases. The correct term is 43 thousand, not thousands. The hyphenation problem can also be seen in the way that you mistakenly wrote one-kilogram sans the hyphen. \n The sentence structures are problematic. It lacks coherence due to the mixed-up English words that you used to create the sentences. This tells me that you are a beginner in learning the English language. I strongly suggest that you brush up on your basic English vocabulary. Reading English comic books and watching shows with English sub-titles should help you become more familiar with the way English sentences are developed, constructed, and presented to the reading public. You will definitely learn from those examples. \n Don't worry, the essay is simple enough to understand. The point of your essay can still be found in the writing, although reading the essay causes some confusion for the native English speakers.

It's clear you have a personal connection to the subject and some experiences you wanted to share. However, there are several areas where improvement could help clarify your message and engage your readers more effectively.

Firstly, addressing the essay's response to its topic, it seems there's a mix of personal narrative and arguments for vegetarianism. To make your essay more focused, try to clearly state your main argument or thesis at the beginning. This could be about the benefits of vegetarianism or your personal journey towards it. Once you have a clear main idea, ensure each paragraph supports or builds upon that idea.

Regarding spelling and grammar, there are a few issues to note. It's important to consistently spell words correctly, especially key terms like ""vegetarian."" Also, pay attention to correct noun phrases (""43 thousand"" instead of ""thousands"") and proper use of hyphens (e.g., ""one-kilogram""). Misuse of words can confuse readers; for example, mixing up ""you"" and ""your."" Improving these aspects will make your essay easier to read and understand.

Your sentence structures sometimes make the essay hard to follow. The essay would benefit from more attention to how sentences are constructed, ensuring they flow logically from one to the next. This coherence is crucial for keeping your readers engaged and making your arguments clear. Brushing up on basic English vocabulary and sentence structure can greatly help in this area. Reading materials in English, such as comic books, and watching shows with subtitles can be beneficial practices.

The essay's strength lies in the passion for the topic and the inclusion of significant facts, like the comparison of water usage between producing meat and wheat. To further strengthen your essay, make sure each fact or argument directly supports your main idea. It's also helpful to integrate personal experiences in a way that highlights the essay's main points.

Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice. Continue to write and seek feedback, focusing on one or two improvement areas at a time. Your interest in important topics and willingness to share your perspective are commendable traits of a developing writer. Keep working on the clarity of your message and the precision of your English, and your writing will surely improve.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Narrative
4605,https://essayforum.com/writing/respect-educators-criticism-teaching-methods-94944/,dev,Respect for educators and criticism for their teaching methods,"Choosing the teaching program in high school is a hotly debated topic in today's world. Some people believe that two-way communication in the high school environment could undermine students' sense of regard and order. However, there are more significant reasons that this approach could bring academic achievements. \n On the one hand, there is a common belief that respect for educators may be lost thanks to this teaching method. Due to this methodology, an important reason is that high school educators could be usually immature and inexperienced. They could not give teachers constructed advice, as a result, and they could lose their temper and overreact once time educators discipline them. The problem could be further exacerbated when all students see their peers criticizing teachers. It is because they can believe that it is the right way to behave with teachers and imitate it. \n On the other hand, I side with those who believe that encouraging students to express their feelings and points of view towards teachers could enhance educational quality. The reason for this is that educators could have a chance better their pedagogical skills after receiving feedback from students. For example, when students complain about the lecture speed, such as the lecture being so fast that they can fully understand this, educators would judge and attempt solutions including lecturing more slowly and detailed. Therefore, high school learners could be proactive in studying and achieve higher academically. \n In conclusion, although some people argue that open discussions between educators and learners could result in a lack of regard and discipline, there is stronger evidence that this action could bring advantages for both students and teachers. It is recommended that high schools should promote this educational method in teaching programs.",<quotation>two-way communication</quotation> \n There is a lack of clarity in your prompt restatement. What is the 2 ay communication? How does it relate to the original prompt? Your overall paragraph discussion leaves the examiner wondering what you are actually trying to say. It is almost as if you are assuming that the reader has access to the original prompt so you did not put much of an effort into discussing it in your representation. You must make the prompt restatement as clear and connected as possible to the original because that is the basis of your preliminary score. That one paragraph alone can decide if you will pass or fail this test. Take care when creating this paragraph. It provides a majority of your scoring consideration later on.,"Your essay addresses the topic of integrating a teaching program that encourages open dialogue between students and teachers in high schools. However, to improve your essay, consider the following points:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay somewhat responds to the topic but lacks clarity in explaining what ""two-way communication"" entails. It's important to clearly define key terms like this so that readers fully understand the context and your stance on the issue. For example, specify that ""two-way communication"" refers to a teaching approach where students actively provide feedback to teachers and participate in the learning process. This will make your argument stronger and more understandable.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: Your essay has some minor grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasing which can distract the reader. For instance, in the sentence, ""They could not give teachers constructed advice,"" it would be more correct to say, ""They might not be able to offer constructive feedback to teachers."" Paying attention to verb tense consistency and sentence structure will significantly improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your point of view is mostly clear; you support the idea that open discussions between educators and students can enhance educational quality. However, clarifying your stance at the beginning and maintaining a consistent argument throughout the essay will strengthen it. Make sure each paragraph supports your point of view in a coherent and logical manner.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments are on the right track but need more detail and examples to be convincing. For instance, when discussing how feedback from students could improve teaching, provide specific examples or studies that support this claim. Additionally, ensure your arguments directly relate to the topic and clearly back up your viewpoint.

5. **Clarity and Connection to the Original Prompt**: It's essential to fully restate and connect your discussion to the original prompt at the beginning of your essay. This not only helps the reader understand the context but also ensures that you are directly addressing the question asked. Make sure to revisit the original prompt and make the connection to your essay's argument explicit.

By focusing on these areas, you can enhance your essay's clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. Remember, every argument should be clearly defined and supported with specific examples or evidence. Paying attention to grammar and sentence structure will also help improve the overall quality of your writing.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

From a personal view, I believe this is a positive trend in a large extent, although it may cause adverse impacts as well. \n Having access to other countries' products enables people to lead a happy life because it can improve their living standers. Due to the geometric limitations, some products are not able to grow in other countries, such as cherries, which are native to North America but can hardly grow in Thailand. If people can taste things from another side of the world, they are likely to enjoy more in their life. In addition, some products are also cheaper to buy from other nations than from the local. It will decline people's living cost and save money to tackle other urgent problems. \n Another benefit of this progress is that it can contribute to culture communication between countries. Products from other areas, especially those containing certain local features, can usually convey traditional culture. For example, if people from Europe purchase china, they are likely willing to know more about Chinese culture. In this way, the misunderstanding between two different culture will reduce. \n Despite the advantages mentioned above, purchasing other countries' products will have a negative influence on local companies' development. As people tend to buy things which are not made by the local companies, native companies can hardly make profits from the customers. As a result, these companies may not survive the intense competition brought by foreigner products. \n In conclusion, it cannot be prevented from people buying imported products. I believe it is a good trend as it contributes to people's life quality as well as culture communication.","Dear student, you should aim for clear and concise writing at all times. Do not try to meet the word count by using more words, that will not help increase your scores. Instead, discuss your paragraphs using clear words that show an advanced grasp of the English language. Rather than saying ""are now able to"", go for the short but clear alternative ""can now buy goods..."" The increase in your score does not come from a high word usage, it comes from how well you are able to express yourself clearly in English using the proper words. \n Now, you created a prompt deviation in your discussion. Remember, the question being asked is: \n ... to what extent do the benefits of this development outweigh the problem? \n Therefore, the response to the question is: \n <em>The advantages presented by this shopping situation far outweighs the possible negative effects.</em> \n There is no need for an apostrophe after the word ""countries"", you are merely presenting the plural form of country, you are not making an ownership statement which is when the apostrophe is often used. You have also misrepresented a word in that you referred to ""standers"" when you meant to say ""Standards."" Please develop your English vocabulary so that you will not make mistakes in word usage and references in the future. These will have a direct deductible effect on your LR score. Also, ""geometric"" is a term related to geometry measurements. Your term should have been ""geological"" which means land location. There are several other word usage errors in this essay that create confusion and stress when reading your essay. This will result in a lower GRA score. \n Now, it is not my duty to explain each and every word mistake in your essay so let me just say this, always refer to a dictionary when writing your practice test to make sure you are using the correct word for the sentiment you wish to convey. If possible, make the English dictionary your bible, your bedtime reading. That is the best way to familiarize yourself with English words and its meanings. Read it from cover to cover until you have the words and meanings memorized by heart. \n I cannot continue to review your essay at this point because of the problems with your word usage. I strongly suggest that you do better with word usage in your next practice test. Do not try to use words you are unsure of, just use words you are sure means what you want to say. Otherwise, you risk failing due to C&C, LR, and GRA problems. \n Let me close on this note instead. You are allowed a maximum of 5 paragraphs for any given Task 2 discussions. If you feel that you can cover 5 paragraphs for a given discussion then that is alright. It will even increase your scoring considerations overall because you get to show your English writing skills to a greater extent. While this could have been done in 4 paragraphs, 5 is not a problem in terms of presentation. That choice, regarding the paragraph count is left to the discretion of the writer. As long as you write a minimum of 2 reasoning paragraphs, your reasoning considerations will be fine and acceptable to the examiner.","The essay discusses the impact of buying products made in other countries, focusing on the benefits and potential problems. Here are specific areas for improvement:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay attempts to answer the question by weighing the benefits against the problems of international trade. However, it drifts away from directly addressing ""to what extent do the benefits outweigh the problems."" A clearer stance on this will make your argument stronger. For example, state explicitly that the advantages significantly outweigh the disadvantages, and focus your essay around this argument.

2. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Aim for clear and concise writing. Avoid using more words than necessary as it doesn't contribute to a higher score. For instance, instead of saying ""people these days are able to buy goods made by other countries,"" you could say ""people can now buy international products"". This kind of straightforward language shows a strong command of English.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Word Usage**: Pay attention to spelling and correct word usage. For example, ""standers"" should be ""standards"", and ""geometric limitations"" should be ""geographical limitations"". These mistakes can confuse readers and lower your scores. Regularly consult a dictionary to ensure you're using words correctly and to improve your vocabulary. Remember, precise language is key to a high-scoring essay.

4. **Point of View**: Your viewpoint is somewhat clear; you view the trend of buying international products positively. However, enhancing the clarity of your argument by directly stating your stance in the introduction and conclusion will strengthen your essay.

5. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay lists benefits such as improved standard of living and cultural exchange, and briefly mentions the negative impact on local businesses. Ensure each argument is clearly supported with examples and explore these examples in depth. It would also help to contrast benefits with problems more directly to persuasively argue that benefits outweigh problems.

6. **Stylistic Issues**: Avoid unnecessary apostrophes and ensure pluralization is correct (e.g., ""countries' products"" should be ""products from other countries"" if not indicating possession). Also, structuring your essay into paragraphs based on points discussed can improve readability and organization. Utilizing up to 5 paragraphs effectively can showcase your writing ability better.

7. **Additional Consideration for Essay Structure**: Your current structure is adequate, but consider using a five-paragraph format to maximize your score. This includes an introduction, at least two paragraphs focusing on reasoning, and a conclusion. This not only demonstrates your ability to organize thoughts but also your skill in making complex arguments clear.

By working on these areas, especially focusing on precise language use and directly addressing the essay prompt, your writing will become more effective and likely to achieve a higher score.",3,4,4,2,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer \n Although quite different, it is undeniable that both books and experience provide us with rich and solid knowledge. Their importance and role have sparked debate among scholars and scientists. Some would agree that books are the primary way to obtain knowledge, while others consider experience as being more efficient and reliable, which makes picking one option above the other tremendously hard. However, the quote in the question perfectly reflects my point of view on the matter, which I'll elaborate on in this essay. \n First of all, humans have long relied on experience to acquire knowledge. Indeed, we have not always had books to provide us with techniques on how to survive, make food or treat an injury. Therefore, experience was the only solution for us to develop those skills. Cooking, hunting or building houses were always taught through experiences. For instance, it was only by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other did we learn how to make fire. \n Secondly, experimental knowledge is tangible. Unlike the theoretical knowledge, we obtain through academics, knowledge gained from experience is more practical and beneficial to perform everyday tasks. Personally speaking, I've built my knowledge through books and academic materials I studied in university; therefore, I was totally unfamiliar with the professional life. When I started my first job, I was utterly lost and incapable of coping with the stress that comes with a job. Only then did I realize how useful experience can be. \n Moreover, experience is a unique way of acquiring knowledge and learning new things. As the quote states, I firmly believe that books can't cover all aspects of life and therefore experience is much needed to develop special skills. Through trial and mistakes, experience teaches us how to be cautious and avoid certain things. For instance, when a child touches boiling water and realize how painful it is, he is most likely not to repeat that action again, to avoid the pain. We need to touch the teapot to know whether the tea inside is hot or not. \n In conclusion, I believe that both books and experience present their own advantages and give us the necessary knowledge in different ways. I favor experimental knowledge over academics for its efficiency, but I also do believe that a combination of both would be the key to solid knowledge.","A TOEFL test does not require a flowery and empty topic restatement. What sets it apart from the IELTS test is that an imemediate discussion should be found in the first paragraph. No restatement, just the personal opinion basis and starling explanation. \n There are some rules that apply to both tests though. The writer should avoid the use of contractions in writing as this reflects negatively on his formal wiling skills. While an academic tone and writing style are not formal requirements, keeping in line with those specifications helps the examiner assess how one might perform academically in class. \n Using group pronouns in a single person reference setting should be avoided. Avoid speaking for others as they cannot be represented within the writing requirements. Focus on personal evidence usage instead. It shows off comprehension skills in relation to discussion relevance. \n Improvements are needed all around in the writing but the essence of the response is clear. Next time though, be sure to address oneself directly in the essay.","Your essay effectively addresses the topic by comparing and contrasting knowledge gained from books with knowledge gained from experience. You make a clear argument in favor of experiential learning, which aligns well with the prompt's request for a personal opinion supported by specific reasons and examples. Here are some points to consider for improvement:

1. **Introduction:** It's important to dive directly into your main argument in the opening paragraph. Instead of restating the question or offering a broad statement about the debate between books and experience, begin with your thesis – your view on why experiential learning is more valuable. This approach grabs the reader's attention and sets the stage for your argument right away.

2. **Formality and Tone:** Be mindful of the formality required for essays in English proficiency tests. Avoid using contractions (for example, use ""cannot"" instead of ""can't"") to maintain a formal tone. Also, ensure your writing style is academic, which helps demonstrate your ability to compose essays in an educational context.

3. **Pronoun Usage:** Pay attention to the use of pronouns. In academic writing, and especially in essays where you're asked for your opinion, it's important to speak from your perspective. Avoid using ""we"" or ""us"" when discussing general knowledge or personal experiences. Instead, focus on using ""I"" to make your essay more personal and direct, which is particularly important when providing examples from your own life.

4. **Supporting Details:** You've provided good examples to support your preference for experiential learning. To strengthen your essay further, ensure these examples are directly linked to your main argument. This means not just stating that experience is valuable, but also explaining how it contrasts with book learning in specific, personal ways. For instance, when discussing your first job experience, elaborating on how it provided insights that books could not would reinforce your argument.

5. **Clarity and Specificity:** Make sure every paragraph clearly supports your point of view. Each paragraph should introduce a new aspect of why you believe experiential learning is more important, followed by specific examples or explanations. Avoid generic statements; instead, offer descriptive details that paint a clear picture of your experiences and how they have shaped your understanding.

In summary, your essay has a solid foundation and presents a thoughtful comparison between book learning and experiential learning. By focusing on these areas for improvement, your essay can become more engaging, persuasive, and academically formal. This will not only make your argument stronger but also showcase your English language proficiency more effectively.",3,4,4,4,4,3,1,4,4,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic**: You have effectively introduced the topic and discussed both viewpoints as the prompt requires. Nonetheless, the development of your personal opinion, which is a crucial component of the essay, is insufficient. To enhance your essay, consider adding a separate paragraph specifically dedicated to elaborating on your own viewpoint. This would not only fulfill the essay requirements more comprehensively but also add depth to your discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some spelling and grammatical issues within the essay that could distract readers. For example, ""thinks"" should be ""think"" in the prompt paraphrase, and ""Children can be addicted to those digital things"" could be more formally expressed as ""Children can become addicted to these digital platforms."" Aim to proofread your essay for such errors to improve clarity and professionalism. Moreover, transitioning between ideas could be smoother to help the reader follow your argument more easily.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is mentioned but not deeply explored. It is vital to express your stance clearly and support it with specific arguments and examples. An additional paragraph dedicated to your opinion, as mentioned, would allow you to provide this necessary detail and explanation.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While you have provided reasons for both sides of the argument, the evidence and examples used could be more specific and robust. For instance, when mentioning the educational benefits of TV and games, citing specific studies or statistics could make your argument more persuasive. Similarly, when discussing the negatives such as addiction and health issues, concrete examples or data would strengthen your case.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion briefly reiterates your stance but lacks strength due to the underdeveloped personal opinion in the body of the essay. A more detailed conclusion that summarizes the key points made and clearly states your viewpoint, supported by the arguments outlined in the essay, would make for a more compelling end to your discussion.

In summary, focusing on clearly and thoroughly developing your personal viewpoint, improving the grammatical accuracy, and enhancing the specificity and support of your arguments will significantly improve your essay.

4609,https://essayforum.com/writing/population-young-adults-far-higher-elderly-94068/,dev,The population of young adults has been far higher than that of elderly people in some countries,"In recent years, the population of young adults has been far higher than that of elderly people in some countries. This trend may be advantageous to some extent, but I am of the opinion that its drawbacks are eclipsed by its benefits. \n On the one hand, an increasing young population and a falling old one contribute to national economic development. In fact, young people tend to acquire knowledge in a quicker way than the elderly. Therefore, the country will have a well-educated prospective workforce in the near future, leading to economic growth. Furthermore, there are several social welfare expenses for the elderly. These could include pension and healthcare services. With a decreasing old population, the government can save a large amount of money; therefore, it can invest their budget in some more urgent aspects of life involving education, infrastructure, poverty, and so on. \n On the other hand, I believe that this phenomenon possesses more demerits than merits. Firstly, the large number of young people may result in job losses. As the labor market is becoming increasingly competitive, it is undoubtedly difficult for young job seekers to find a high-paying job. Consider Vietnam, where many university graduates are unable to find work despite holding excellent bachelor's degrees. Second, while young people are apprehensive, the older generation has more work experience. They seem to be more dominant than the young when it comes to complicated cases. Too many young workers in a company can lead to unproductivity. \n In conclusion, in spite of some advantages, I argue that this trend comprises more disadvantages associated with employment loss and companies' unproductivity.","There is a redundancy existing in your opinion statement. The double presentation of your openion in a single sentence led to a confusing idea presentation. The fust half of the sentence is already clear and only required the short reasoning topics to support it. The last half of the statement was the correct response but it was lacking the summarized reasons presentation. So, even though the restatement is accurate, the paragraph will still receive demerits in terms of accuracy, coherence, and word usage because of o presentation confusion.. \n Now, scoring is only applied to relevant paragraphs. Your first reasoning presentation does not qualify for scoring. This presentation contradicts your previously stated point of view. The examiner expects to read 2 supporting reasons in independent paragraphs. What does this mean? You are showing an indecisive opinion, meaning you cannot really support your own opinion as the essay requires. This runs counter to the single opinion support requirement. It will be stricken from consideration and deducted from the word count. It will be an obstacle to passing the teat. \n What you should have done was focus on developing the 2 reasons you presented in the second paragraph.These are the 2 independent reasons that should have been developed within 5 sentences per paragraph. Properly explaining these reasons would have resulted in a maximum overall scoring consideration. The concluding summary also does not meet the I sentence, 40 word requirement so it cannot be given a passing mark either. \n You understood the topic and discussion requirements. It was the response format that is incorrect. I am sure you will do better next time as you now have a writing guideline to go by.","Your essay attempts to address the topic of demographic changes in certain countries, focusing on the implications of having a younger population compared to an older one. You present both sides of the argument, which shows an understanding of the topic. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall impact.

1. **Clarity and Coherence:** The introduction of your essay contains a redundancy in stating your opinion. You mention that the drawbacks of a younger population eclipse its benefits but then reiterate the point. A more effective approach would be to state your opinion clearly once and briefly mention the reasons you will explore in the essay. This helps prevent confusion and maintains the reader's focus on your main argument.

2. **Stance and Argumentation:** Your essay presents an argument that seems to contradict your stated opinion in the first reasoning paragraph. You first highlight the benefits, which could imply support for the trend of a younger population. However, the task requires a clear stance throughout the essay. To fulfill the essay requirements effectively, it's crucial to focus on developing arguments that directly support your viewpoint. For example, if your stance is that the drawbacks of a younger population outweigh the benefits, each paragraph should provide independent reasons supporting this view. 

3. **Paragraph Structure:** Aim to structure your paragraphs around single, clear reasons supporting your stance. Each paragraph should contain about 5 sentences focusing on explaining and expanding on one reason. This not only aids in meeting specific composition requirements but also helps in creating a more persuasive and cogent argument. 

4. **Concluding Summary:** The conclusion of your essay falls short of the required format, which seeks a concise summarization of your arguments in about one sentence of 40 words. Your conclusion should encapsulate your stance and the key points made throughout the essay in a succinct manner. This will help in meeting the requirements and enhancing the impact of your conclusion.

5. **Response to the Topic:** Despite these areas for improvement, it's clear that you understand the topic and the discussion requirements. Your task now is to adjust your response format to align more closely with the guidelines provided. This involves ensuring that each part of your essay—the introduction, the body paragraphs, and the conclusion—clearly and effectively supports your main argument.

By focusing on these areas, specifically on maintaining a consistent stance throughout and effectively developing your arguments, you can create a more coherent, persuasive, and well-structured essay. Remember, clarity and support for your viewpoint are key to effectively responding to the essay prompt. Keep practicing, and you will see improvement.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Employers require various skills from the job applicants. It has been argued that practical skills are more important than academic knowledge in the workplace. However, in my opinion, academic knowledge will never be unnecessary. \n Firstly, there is some sort of jobs that do not require a high level of knowledge such as laundering and car washing. Employers of these industries often employ workers with good practical skills and work experience. Nevertheless, a minimum level of education and theoretical knowledge must be satisfied. For example, mathematical calculation skills are extremely valuable for workers in such jobs so they can manage the financial budget. Furthermore, employers prefer educated workers than illiterate in managerial positions. This result in a good administration for the workplace.","@near9 You have just wasted your only chance to get a full review of your writing abilities by not posting the full essay.

That means you must say ""I disagree with this statement to a certain extent due to several personal beliefs. These beliefs will be discussed in support of my stance in the following paragraphs.</em> \n As you know, only the paraphrasing is allowed in the opening statement. You actual statement of support must only be within the parameters set forth by the original prompt. Hence the indication that you ""disagree to a certain extent"" as indicated in the prompt requirements. \n Your first paragraph lacks cohesion because you are discussing unrelated topics through the paragraph. When you discuss labor jobs at the start, the succeeding justification for the theoretical knowledge must be in reference to the same jobs. So, people who wash clothes need to have theoretical knowledge on how to compute for soap usage per wash load and other similar information with the previous jobs mentioned.","The essay attempts to address the topic of whether practical skills or academic knowledge are more valuable in the workplace. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and the overall argument.

1. **Addressing the Topic**: The essay starts by acknowledging the debate between practical skills and academic knowledge but lacks a clear stance in the opening statement. To improve, explicitly state agreement or disagreement with the given statement right at the beginning. For example: ""While practical skills are crucial, I believe academic knowledge is equally essential."" This approach directly responds to the prompt, providing a clear standpoint from which to develop your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing in the essay. For instance, ""there is some sort of jobs"" should be corrected to ""there are certain types of jobs."" Pay attention to singular and plural agreement, and use concise language to make your point more clearly. Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure to maintain the reader's interest. Reading your essay out loud might help you catch and correct these errors.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay does present a viewpoint that academic knowledge is indispensable. However, this perspective needs to be asserted more strongly throughout the essay. Consistently refer back to your main argument in each section of the essay to reinforce your stance.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay mentions jobs that might not require high academic qualifications but fails to fully explain how even these positions benefit from academic knowledge, making the argument seem incomplete. When introducing examples, ensure they directly support your claim. If mentioning laundry and car wash jobs, directly tie back to how academic skills, like basic math for budget management, are crucial in these contexts. This connection needs to be clear and explicit to strengthen your argument.

5. **Cohesion and Coherence**: The essay sometimes discusses unrelated ideas within the same paragraph, making it harder for the reader to follow your argument. To improve cohesion, each paragraph should focus on one main idea. For instance, if discussing the necessity of academic knowledge in manual jobs, devote the entire paragraph to elaborating on this point with relevant examples and explanations.

6. **Specific, Actionable Suggestions**:
   - Begin with a clear thesis statement that directly responds to the essay prompt.
   - Review and edit for grammatical accuracy and clarity of expression.
   - Ensure each paragraph focuses on a single main idea with clear support for your argument.
   - Use examples directly related to the argument you're making, ensuring they clearly support your viewpoint.

By addressing these points, the essay can become more cohesive, persuasive, and aligned with the expectations of an academic argument. Remember, the strength of an essay lies not just in the ideas presented but in how effectively those ideas are communicated.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Argumentative

I personally hold the opinion that it is wrong to treat them in workplace because of their gender. \n In today's world both men and women have the equally rights in education, public and organizations. In other words, both of them can have access to the same educational opportunities, this means that they can have the same professional and educational skills. To illustrate, In the UK there are similar numbers of male and female students in higher education. In addition, now women can compete with men in any kind of field even in sport. For instance, they were often employed as secretaries or receptionists, but today they are able to even be a supervisor or strong politicians. Nevertheless, traditionally women have been restricted to certain roles such as builder or fireman. \n On the other hand, still it is widely believed that both of sexes have got inequally talents and disabilities. In fact, it can be observed that in military services mainly men are employed as a result of their aggressive and brave character, whereas women are often employed in kindergarden and schools. Therefore, there have certain jobs which only one of the gender member do it perfectly. For instance, males are good at army as a soldier while females are better in hospitals as a nurse and in primary schools as a teacher. Nonetheless, in our modern life it is unfair discriminate them because of their sexes, since they can do anything at the same quality as their opponent gender do. \n To sum up, it seems to me that it is true both of them have got pros and cons, but nowadays a wide range of occupations are available to both gender and also career success depends on individual merit.","Abror, is this a topic that you chose by yourself to discuss? Or was this a topic assigned for discussion in class? The prompt doesn't seem complete to me. There seem to be some missing elements in the instructions that I can see reflected in your response. Would it be too much of a bother for you to post the complete prompt? That is if the instructions were given in class and is not something that you just chose to discuss. Your task accuracy score will depend upon it. \n In the general review of your essay though, I would have to say that you did a pretty good job of defending your stance. However, you should try to always do your comparison of the skills of men and women in the same field. Take for example, your discussion about gender roles in the military. Both the men and women already fight on the front lines of the battle field. Therefore, it is wrong for you to say that men work better in the battlefield and the women work better in the background. You need to increase your knowledge of world events and gender discussions in order to better and more accurately develop your gender discussions. Use of no longer applicable information, such as the case of the military example could have an adverse effect on your score as well.","Your essay addresses an important topic regarding gender roles and equality in the workplace. You've done well in presenting your view that both males and females should not be treated differently based on their gender. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your argument stronger and clearer.

**1. Responding to the Essay Topic:**
It's not entirely clear if the topic was a given assignment or chosen by you. Ensure that your essay directly and comprehensively responds to the assigned topic. If the task instructions are more specific than what's addressed in your essay, it's essential to cover all aspects of the prompt to meet the task accuracy requirements.

**2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
There are a few spelling and grammatical errors in your essay, such as ""inequally talents and disabilities"" which might be better expressed as ""unequal talents and abilities."" Also, be cautious of sentence structure and punctuation to make your writing more readable. For example, ""In today's world both men and women have the equally rights in education, public and organizations,"" could be more clearly written as ""In today's world, both men and women have equal rights in education, the public sphere, and organizations.""

**3. Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
Your stance on gender equality in the workplace is clear. However, supporting arguments are sometimes generalized or rely on stereotypes that may not accurately represent current trends or sensitivities in gender roles. 

**4. Arguments Supporting the Position:**
While you've illustrated your view with examples, some of these do not fully support your argument due to outdated information or overgeneralization. For instance, the comparison of men in the military to women in schools or hospitals might not reflect the current situation accurately, where both genders are increasingly present in diverse roles across various fields. It's crucial to use up-to-date and relevant examples to strengthen your argument. Avoid making broad generalizations about what jobs are suitable for a certain gender. Instead, focus on evidence showing that skills and professional success are not dependent on gender but on individual merit and qualifications.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Work on presenting more current and accurate examples to support your argument. Research recent developments in gender roles in various fields.
- Improve the clarity of your writing by paying close attention to grammatical structures and punctuation.
- Ensure your arguments are directly related to the topic and cover all aspects mentioned in the task prompt.

Remember, a strong essay on this topic would benefit from specific, updated examples and a clear, grammatically correct presentation of ideas.

Corporations contribute to society economically. However, in the changing times corporation has a responsibility towards society and environment apart from maximizing profits. \n Activities of a corporation have a direct impact on its stakeholders. Stakeholders include investors, employees, partners, government, community and environment. A corporation has a dual responsibility, to make profits and contribute to the development of society as a whole. Many corporations and manufacturing plants use hazardous chemicals for their processes. These toxic chemicals if not disposed properly contaminate both air and water. Water in streams gets contaminated due to run off. Polluted water can affect the local flora and fauna in addition to the dangers posed to the aquatic species. The chemicals like lithium and sulfur are known to inhibit the reproduction in some species thus making them endangered. The harmful gases which are generally the by -product of several chemical processes pollute the air. Use of Chlorofluorocarbons by corporations has lead to ozone hole and global warming. It has increased the risk of skin cancer and other respiratory diseases. \n Corporations have a responsibility towards the society and environment. The regulation and safety procedures have to be followed rigorously by them to reduce the harmful effects. This can be reiterated by examples such as gas spill in gulf by BP. It not only added costs to the corporation to cleanse and pay in fines but also affected the market shares. Similarly, plastics are often used for packaging by corporations are non-biodegradable and can be a threat to the environment. Minimizing the usage of such materials and promoting eco friendly materials will help a corporation in the long run. Compliance with the laws will provide an opportunity for the corporation in the long term by providing them tax breaks. \n Another reason corporations can be beneficial to the society is by creating better working conditions for the employees and support for a cause. By this means, the corporation can earn a good reputation, thus increasing the educated workforce and consumer base. Better health plans and policies will help build a motivated work force, which will increase the profits. Being a proponent for a cause or charity will help increase the customer base and loyalty of customers towards a corporation.","Payal, is this essay meant for a research paper or an IELTS Task 2 test?

If this is based upon a research paper, I need your complete thesis statement instead so that I can point out the areas for improvement in your discussion.","This essay makes a substantial attempt to discuss the responsibilities of corporations beyond merely generating profit, taking into account their societal and environmental impacts. However, for further improvement and clarity, several aspects need to be considered and refined.

Firstly, it's crucial to ensure that the essay fully responds to the given topic. The introduction of the essay appears to lack a clear thesis statement or a prompt question. To enhance clarity, explicitly state the essay's aim or question being addressed. This will set a clear direction and purpose for the discussion.

Secondly, while the essay contains valuable points, there are notable spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For instance, sentences like ""Activities of a corporation have a direct impact on its stakeholders"" could be better structured as ""Corporations' activities directly impact their stakeholders."" Additionally, watch out for punctuation and proper usage of spacing around punctuation marks. Focusing on sentence structure and coherence will make the arguments more accessible and persuasive to the reader.

Regarding the point of view, the essay does convey a stance that corporations have broader responsibilities. However, reinforcing this viewpoint with more specific examples and linking them clearly to the overarching argument would make it more compelling. Consider introducing real-world cases earlier in the essay and analyze how these instances support your argument more deeply.

In terms of arguments, the essay suggests that corporations affect society and the environment and have responsibilities in these areas. These points are crucial but need to be elaborated further. For instance, when discussing harmful practices, detail how corporations can adopt more sustainable alternatives. Additionally, while mentioning benefits like better working conditions and support for causes, specify how these efforts directly impact societal development and corporate sustainability.

A significant strength of the essay is its use of examples, such as the BP oil spill and the problems with non-biodegradable plastics. These examples are effective in illustrating the essay's points but ensure that each example is directly linked to the argument about corporate responsibility. Expanding on how corporations can mitigate such issues and the long-term benefits of doing so will add depth to the discussion.

Finally, the conclusion successfully reiterates the dual responsibility of corporations but could be enhanced by summarizing key points more strongly and suggesting actionable steps or further areas for research. 

Overall, the essay presents a thoughtful examination of corporate responsibilities towards society and the environment. Refining its structure, clarity, and argumentative support will make it a more powerful and persuasive piece.

Many believe that they will do all jobs eventually, in my opinion, I just agree to certain extent \n There are various advantages that artificially intelligence robots bring to out life. Firstly, it takes less time to finish a job while the quality is guaranteed. For instance, some jobs which are repetitive such as produce shoes, the robots will do it with perfection and they are not likely to be bored or exhausted. In addition, inspite of their' high cost, they can help cut off human resource in companies, that will lead to the decrease in the amount of money that business owners pay for workers every months. It is such a good deal for them. \n On the other hand, there are still some jobs that robots can not do perfectly at all. Some jobs that need human touch, flexible thinking and objective decisions can not be done by robots. For example, the jobs which are related to education, medical system have numerous complicated problem that algorithmic can not solve, so people have to do them by themselves. Besides, it will be a threat to human someday if they depend dramatically on robots. Robots have artificial intelligence and they learn from human everyday, in the future, they may control the world and people will be in danger. \n In conclusion, there are benefits and drawbacks in this argument.

However, there are several areas where it could be improved to make your argument clearer and more effective. Here's some constructive feedback focusing on the aspects you've asked about:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay partially addresses the prompt by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence in the workplace. However, it seems to miss a clear positioning or stance. When expressing your opinion, it's crucial to be definitive about your viewpoint. Instead of stating ""I just agree to a certain extent,"" you could frame your thesis more clearly, such as presenting a limitation on the role of artificial intelligence due to inherent human qualities and the essential value of human labor.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are a few areas where the essay could be improved in terms of language use:
   - ""Todays"" should be ""Today,"" and ""artificially intelligence robots"" should be ""artificial intelligence robots.""
   - Be mindful of possessive forms; ""their' high cost"" should be ""their high cost.""
   - Watch out for missing punctuation and run-on sentences, especially around your main argument. It helps to break down complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences.
   - ""inspite"" is traditionally written as ""in spite,"" and ""every months"" should be ""every month.""

3. **Point of View of the Author**: Your point of view is introduced but not strongly asserted. Clarify your stance by structuring your essay to lead with your opinion, followed by the reasons supporting your view and a clear thesis statement. This structure helps in making your perspective unmistakable to the reader.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: You've attempted to provide arguments for both sides, which is excellent. However, your essay could benefit from more specific examples and a clearer link between your arguments and your overall stance on artificial intelligence. While you mention the potential for robots to excel in certain tasks and the dangers of over-reliance, specifying how AI's limitations impact its ability to replace human jobs could strengthen your argument. For instance, emphasizing that AI lacks the creativity, empathy, and ethical judgment of humans could make your point more compelling.

This essay will point out various forms of those major issues and express the author's opinion. \n Without a doubt, many substantial problems in terms of society, health and technology can be caused by mobile phones. To be specific, phones are popularly viewed as a primary means of communication due to their varying helpful features, which contributes to modern worsening society interaction such as forgetting how to talk with real humans. Furthermore, varied serious mental and psychological issues associated with modern users, for instance, poor eyesight, stressfulness and depression caused by radio waves undoubtedly lower people's productivity and efficiency in their studies and work. Lastly, as many users believe in the security technology, they decide to store their private data there, however, some brands produce dead phones and they do not even work out on the errors. \n On the other hand, mobile phones significantly influence humans' life in the modern world.

However, there are several areas where it can be improved to better meet the requirements of the essay topic and to provide clearer, more direct arguments.

1. **Relevance to the Essay Topic:**
   Your essay should closely follow the original topic given. It seems that your essay strays from the specific prompts or questions provided. Make sure to fully understand the discussion topic and directly address the questions or prompts given. Restating the essay prompt accurately in the introduction helps ensure your essay is on track.

2. **Essay Structure and Content:**
   While your essay includes a variety of points, it’s important to focus on developing direct and relevant responses. Essays generally benefit from being structured around a few key arguments – consider limiting yourself to three main points (one per paragraph) and expanding on these with clear, specific examples and explanations. Each paragraph should ideally be around five sentences and directly relate to the topic at hand. 

3. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
   Aim for simplicity and clarity in your writing. It's more effective to give straightforward answers to the questions asked than to include a lot of extra information or analysis that may take your essay off-topic. Overcomplicating your responses or attempting to cover too many points can detract from the overall coherence and impact of your essay. 

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   Be attentive to spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. Errors in these areas can distract from your message and make your essay harder to follow. Your essay could benefit from a more consistent use of tense and more careful choice of words (e.g., ""varying people argue"" could be simplified to ""some people argue"").

5. **Point of View and Arguments:**
   Your point of view does come through in your essay, but make sure that each argument supporting your viewpoint is clear, descriptive, and directly tied to the essay’s main topic. Avoid generalizations and ensure that each argument is backed by specific examples or data where possible.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Your conclusion does a good job of summarizing the essay's main points, but remember to reinforce your stance and briefly remind the reader of the key arguments that support your viewpoint. It's also helpful to end with a strong, concluding remark that leaves a lasting impression on the reader.

Focusing on these aspects will greatly improve the structure, clarity, and relevance of your essay.

4615,https://essayforum.com/writing/grandparents-live-together-children-88292/,dev,[WT2] Grandparents should live together with their children and grandchildren or live independently?,"Whether grandparents should live with their families or independently remains debatable. There can be plausible arguments for both sides, as we shall see. \n On the one hand, the elderly should live with their families as part of some traditional beliefs which have been passed on from generation to generation. It is believed that as grandparents sacrificed their lives and enjoyments to make sure their children have a stable upbringing, it is the children's responsibility to take care of their parents when they can no longer work. Grandparents living independently or living in nursing homes may lead to social stigma, which sometimes can be the reason for mental decline in old people and even in other family members. Moreover, it is safer for old people to live with their family to avoid such problems as robbery or accidents. \n On the other hand, those who support the idea of grandparents living on their own often claim that it would be beneficial for both family members and grandparents themselves as it helps create a more comfortable life for all. Many families nowadays are dual-income, which means both parents have to work and they may not have enough time to take care of their old parents. This often leads to old people feeling being left-out or worthlessness, and gradually often they would be depressed. Furthermore, it is also true that living independently or in special care centers, old people have more chance to talk to other people of their age which can bring them the perks of being able to socialize. Indeed, this is what old people often lack if they live with their children because they would be busy at work or at school the entire day. \n In conclusion, although there might be some sound reasons for living in a big family, the better quality and more chances to communicate are the reasons why old family members should choose to live independently.","The approach that you took to creating the paraphrase is a bit incorrect. While you did a good job restating the topic, you could have done better in presenting the reasons to the examiner. Rather than saying that there are plausible arguments on both sides, you should have instead, presented the topics for debate, the 2 sides of the discussion that you will be presenting. That way, you could have also indicated that based on the considerations, you will be presenting an explanation of your conclusion of facts towards the end of the essay. \n The format for this essay is 5 paragraphs composed of: \n Par. 1: Restatement + discussion summary \n Par. 2: First public POV consideration \n Par. 3: Second public POV discussion \n Par. 4: Your opinion as to which side you support \n Par. 5: Reverse summary conclusion \n While you did give a generalized discussion, you failed to offer your personal opinion / conclusion based on the reasons you mentioned. As such, the essay is presenting an incomplete discussion to the examiner and will only be scored on 2 out of 3 discussion requirements.","Your essay on whether grandparents should live with their families or independently provides an insightful look into a topic that is highly relevant in today’s society. You have done well in beginning with a brief overview, presenting arguments for both viewpoints, and concluding with your stance. However, there are several areas where improvements could enhance clarity, persuasiveness, and adherence to typical essay formats, particularly for English proficiency tests. 

First, consider refining your introduction to not only state the topic but also briefly outline the main points that will be discussed. This helps set expectations for the reader and indicates the structure of your argument. Instead of mentioning that there are plausible arguments for both sides, directly state what these arguments are. This will make your essay stronger and clearer right from the start.

Structurally, your essay would benefit from following a more traditional five-paragraph format which includes: 
1. An introductory paragraph that restates the topic and summarizes the discussion.
2. A paragraph presenting the first point of view.
3. A paragraph discussing the opposing viewpoint.
4. A paragraph stating your personal opinion and supporting it with reasons.
5. A conclusion that summarizes the points made and reinforces your opinion.

Your essay somewhat follows this format but misses explicitly stating your personal viewpoint and the reasons behind it. Expressing your opinion clearly, along with the rationale, is crucial for a balanced argumentative essay. It provides a closure to your discussion and makes your essay complete.

Regarding language issues, your essay is mostly well-written but be mindful of minor grammatical errors and the consistency of your argumentation. Reviewing sentence structure and verb tenses for accuracy can also help improve the reading experience.

Moreover, your essay does touch on critical points about social stigma, safety, independence, and the opportunity for socializing, which are strong arguments. However, ensuring that each point is fully developed and supported with examples or further explanation could enhance the persuasiveness of your essay.

In conclusion, the viewpoint of the essay is relatively clear, with a slight lean towards supporting independence for the elderly, but affirming this with a more definitive statement of your opinion supported by mentioned reasons would make a significant improvement. Also, revising for minor spelling and grammatical issues, providing a more structured format, and ensuring clear, actionable arguments supported by examples would elevate your essay significantly. Your exploration of an important social issue is commendable, and with these adjustments, your essay can more effectively communicate your insights and arguments.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to meet the requirements of the essay prompt more effectively and to enhance the overall quality of your writing. Let's explore those areas:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The main issue with your essay is that it doesn't directly address the essay prompt's specific ask: “To what extent do you agree or disagree?”. Your discussion seems to create its own question rather than directly responding to the given prompt, which leads your essay away from the required discussion. For future essays, make sure to clearly understand what the prompt is asking and structure your response accordingly. If the prompt asks for your agreement or disagreement, clearly state your position and consistently support it throughout the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** Your essay has several linguistic errors that obscure your meaning and weaken your argument. For instance, phrases like “whereas funding for public service to all citizenry should be a mainly issue” could be clearer and grammatically correct. Pay attention to verb tense consistency, correct usage of articles (""a,"" ""the""), and preposition use. Using online tools or consulting grammar books can help you improve in these areas.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your essay seems to vacillate between the importance of investing in entertainment and in public services without a clear stance. The essay task typically requires you to choose a side and argue for it, providing specific reasons. Make sure your thesis statement clearly states your viewpoint, and then organize your essay so each paragraph supports that view unambiguously.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While you provide examples, like the investment in the Korean entertainment industry, your arguments could be clearer and more directly connected to your main point. Ensure every paragraph has a clear main idea that supports your overall position. Additionally, when using examples, explain how they directly support your argument. Avoid general statements and aim for specific, compelling evidence.

In terms of structuring your future essays, start by clearly stating your position in response to the essay prompt. Then, organize your essay with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each provide a unique argument supporting your viewpoint, and a conclusive summary that reinforces your thesis without introducing new information.

Lastly, familiarizing yourself with different types of essay prompts and structures, as advised, would greatly benefit your writing process. Understanding when to use a comparative approach versus expressing a single clear opinion based on the task is crucial. Reviewing example essays and practicing writing under different prompts can help you better respond to various essay tasks effectively.

Although there are many advantages of learning a new language, I believe that children should not be forced to learn a foreign language. \n There are two main reason why studying another language have enormous benefits. The first reason is that children can overcome the barrier of language when they study something or they plan to become an oversea student. For example, when children prepare a lesson prior to class, they have to cover a lot of grounds which are usually written by English. Therefore, students who have good English will gain advantages. Furthermore, if children manage to good one foreign language, they will gain a competitive edge in job market in the future. For instance, these days, employers usually require candidates to fluently use a foreign language such as English or Mandarin. \n Despite of these advantages I expressed above, I believe that students should not be forced to learn a foreign language at school. The best way to teach language is that teachers should encourage student to learn language. Teachers should tailor their teaching styles in order to the transmission of knowledge be more lively and effective for example, playing videos or organizing game relate to a foreign language. In addition, schools should make students to understand the important of language in their future life, which will give children motivation to study by themselves. For instance, schools should provide students with workshops relating to the important of language in their career, which will help student to see a big picture of the advantages of studying a foreign language. \n In conclusion, although learning a new language have significant advantages, I strongly believe that schools should encourage instead of forcing student to learn a foreign language.","I am unable to review your essay for content responsiveness, coherence, and cohesiveness due to the lack of the original prompt statement. It will be difficult for me to give you content advice when it might be wrong as I do not know the instruction parameters. Kindly provide the prompt for your next essay. In the meantime, here is a general grammar review of your work. \n You have to limit your work to no more than 290 words, regardless of whether you are taking the pencil or cbt test. Do not focus solely on the number of words you are writing. Make sure instead, that your essay adheres to all the scoring guidelines.

It presents a clear stance, arguing against compulsory foreign language education, instead advocating for encouragement and motivational teaching methods. Here is the feedback aimed at refining and improving the essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay effectively addresses the topic, presenting arguments both for and against the learning of a foreign language in schools before stating a personal belief. Ensure every part of your essay directly relates to the question posed, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the subject.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   - **Grammar and Spelling:** Pay close attention to grammar, particularly the agreement between subjects and verbs (e.g., ""there are two main reasons"" not ""reason"") and the correct use of plural forms. Additionally, watch out for punctuation, such as the missing comma in complex sentences (""when they study something, or they plan""; a comma is needed here).
   - **Comparative Forms:** Use comparative structures correctly. For instance, ""more lively and effective"" should be ""livelier and more effective"".
   - **Word Choice:** Carefully choose words that accurately convey your meaning, ensuring clarity and precision in your arguments.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** The essay’s point of view is coherent and expressed clearly, maintaining a consistent argument against forcing students to learn foreign languages. Ensuring each paragraph reinforces your stance will strengthen your argument further.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay provides examples supporting the benefits of learning a foreign language, it also argues for a motivational approach over compulsion. Enhance these points with more detailed examples and clearer, more direct explanations. Stating how motivational techniques can be more effective than compulsion could further strengthen the argument.

5. **Structural Suggestions:** Consider limiting your essay to the recommended word count to allow time for review and editing, which is crucial for enhancing the quality of your writing. Avoid overextending your essay to ensure you have sufficient time to address any grammatical errors or stylistic issues before submission.

I totally disagree with this view because of the following reasons. \n People should invest their resources to the protection of animals in wildlife for various reasons. Firstly, wild creatures play an essential and irreplaceable role in human's life as well as production. To be specific, in terms of agriculture, pollinating insects such as bumblebees help to produce seeds for many of crop plants, therefore, the decline in such insects has provoked so much concern. Moreover, in terms of economic aspect, wildlife is the cornerstone of tourism, which has the effect of boosting the economy as well as creating many jobs. Human fascination with the wild animals is a driving force to develop the tourism and the economy in local areas. \n Secondly, wild species are vulnerable to face threats from natural diseases such as fire, floods and droughts, and human activities such as hunting, poaching, and land-use practices. Meanwhile, the vanishing of one species can seriously impact on the existence of many others, setting off a chain reaction leading to the imbalanced ecosystem. For example, the near-extinction of gray wolves restored in the Yellowstone National Park due to overhunting leads to the significant decrease in beaver populations. This is because plants that are an important nutrient of beavers for winter survival are more heavily grazed by elk, without the wolf as its predator. \n In conclusion, the importance of wild animals to a continued human existence has never been more obvious than today. They contribute to the development of human life from agriculture to economy aspect. Furthermore, they play a vital role in well-balanced ecosystems. Therefore, it is necessary to spend myriad time as well as money resources to inhibit them from extinction.","You are short by one sentence in the paraphrase.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of the argument presented.

1. **Response to the Topic and Structure**: The essay clearly addresses the topic by stating a disagreement with the view that too much time and money are spent on human aspects rather than on wildlife protection. However, the introduction could be improved. Instead of merely listing ""the following reasons,"" a more engaging approach would be to briefly introduce your key arguments. For instance, mentioning how wildlife contributes to human existence and the ecosystem could hook the reader's interest from the beginning.

Additionally, each paragraph should focus on a single main idea. At present, paragraphs mix multiple reasons and examples, which can confuse readers. By dedicating each paragraph to a single reason and exploring it thoroughly with well-developed examples, the argument would become more compelling and easier to follow.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written with few grammar or spelling mistakes. To improve readability and coherence, consider breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones. This approach helps in conveying points more clearly and makes the text more accessible to a broader audience.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay's point of view is clear but could be stated in a more engaging manner. Rather than a mechanical statement of disagreement, infuse the writing with personal conviction. Phrases like ""I strongly believe"" or ""I am convinced"" followed by concise reasoning make the essay's stance more powerful and personal.

4. **Argumentation and Support**: The arguments presented are valuable but require further development. Offering a single, focused reason per paragraph with detailed examples would strengthen the essay. For instance, instead of briefly mentioning economic benefits and ecological balance together, delve deeper into one aspect per paragraph. Explain how wildlife contributes to the economy through tourism in one paragraph, and discuss its role in maintaining ecosystem balance in another, each with specific examples.

5. **Conclusion Improvements**: The concluding paragraph needs to effectively summarize the essay's main points in a new light, rather than leaving the argument open-ended. It should wrap up the discussion by restating the thesis and main arguments in a fresh manner. This not only reinforces your stance but also demonstrates your ability to present ideas in varied ways.

In summary, focusing on structuring the essay with one idea per paragraph, simplifying complex sentences, and offering a more personalized stance will markedly improve the overall effectiveness and coherence of the argument.

Secondly, educational institutions are not as good as in major cities where offering a wider range of curriculum with varieties of experienced teachers, which attracted a lot of parents to migrate for their children future. Finally, secured and convenient lifestyle, such as access to better health care centers or supermarkets or police stations, has given the reason for many people to move to the major cities from the countryside. \n One way to solve this phenomenon is the governments should encourage businesses to invest and develop in regional areas by implementing an incentive program for reaching certain progress.

For example, you could start with ""Cities around the world are experiencing rapid population growth, leading to numerous challenges.""

2. Development of Ideas: The essay attempts to outline the causes of urban overpopulation and suggests solutions. However, the presentation of these ideas could be more developed. Rather than listing three causes in one paragraph, focusing on two key causes with more in-depth explanation would allow for clearer argumentation. This would enable a more coherent connection between the problem and the suggested solutions. Remember, fully exploring a few ideas is more impactful than briefly mentioning many.

3. Paragraph Structure: Ensure each paragraph contains at least 3-5 sentences to meet the minimum requirement. This structure helps maintain clarity and allows each idea to be adequately explained. Short paragraphs might underrepresent your arguments, while longer paragraphs ensure a thorough exploration of each point.

4. Cohesion and Coherence: The essay would benefit from a clear distinction between the problems and their corresponding solutions. Presenting each problem and its solution in connected paragraphs can aid in developing a cohesive argument. This approach makes it easier for readers to understand the logical flow of your essay.

5. Conclusion: The concluding paragraph should succinctly summarize the discussed problems and solutions instead of introducing new ideas. Aim for a clear and decisive end that reinforces your essay's main points without extending the discussion. This helps solidify your argument and provides a sense of resolution.

6. Grammar and Stylistic Issues: The essay is generally well-written, but minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic improvements could enhance its readability. Pay attention to sentence structure and punctuation to ensure your ideas are communicated clearly.

In addition, people who already suffer lung cancer or asthma make their disease getting worse when the smokers smoke in the same building with them. The diseases affected by the smoke is one of the worrying effects felt by the citizen, hence the smokers should help to reduce the gradual affect by smoking in the right smoking area. \n In conclusion, I am completely support in letting the smokers find another place to smoke since it is surely a kind of respective manners towards passive smokers and a risk to suffer smoke related disease will be decreased.","Dear student, I am not sure what you mean by the constant use of the word ""respective"". It does not fit in the overall context of the sentence / paragraph. What exactly are you trying to say? Do you mean that smokers should ""respect"" non-smokers? If you mean that, then change the word to ""respectful"" or ""respect"" depending how you need to use it in the sentence. Those sentences need to be improved in order to clarify your meaning or reasoning. Your conclusion needs to be better developed. It cannot be just a single, long closing sentence. You will lose points for that. Look at the samples here in order for you to get an idea as to how to better conclude your essay. \n Overall though, you have shown that you understand the prompt and are capable of offering an insightful discussion, based on facts, regarding the topic presented. The proof of your comprehension skills, regardless of the problem with the grammar is sure to earn you some consideration on the part of the examiner when it comes to your final score.","Your essay clearly addresses the topic, demonstrating a good understanding of the issue regarding smoking in public places and its negative impact on people around. Your argument is structured around the necessity for smokers to be considerate of non-smokers and the health implications of secondhand smoke, which is a solid foundation for your essay. 

However, there are several areas where improvement could greatly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing:

1. **Word Choice and Precision**: You frequently use the word “respective” in places where it seems you mean to convey the idea of respect or considerate behavior. The correct words to use would be “respectful” to describe behavior, or “respect” as the noun. For example, “this is a respective behavior” should be changed to “this is respectful behavior.” Reviewing word choice for accuracy will help in better conveying your intended meaning.

2. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues**: While your essay is relatively clear, some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings make it a bit difficult to read smoothly. For instance, “The smokers should have the big awareness” could be revised to “Smokers should be more aware,” which is more natural in English. Additionally, consider using varied sentence structures to make your essay more engaging and easier to follow.

3. **Clear Point of View**: Your viewpoint is clear; you believe that smoking in public places should be restricted to protect non-smokers from the effects of secondhand smoke. This strong stance is good, but be sure to consistently back up your opinions with clear, descriptive arguments throughout your essay.

4. **Development of Arguments**: You provide a good basis for your arguments but often do not fully explore or explain your reasoning. For example, when discussing the health risks of secondhand smoke, introducing specific statistics or studies could make your argument more convincing. Expanding on your points with more details and examples will strengthen your essay.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion of your essay should summarise your main points and restate your position in a compelling way. Instead of ending with a single, long sentence, try to develop a short paragraph that wraps up your essay effectively. This gives you a chance to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

6. **General Coherence and Cohesion**: Aim for smoother transitions between paragraphs and within your arguments. This will help your essay flow better and make it easier for your reader to follow your logic. 

Overall, your essay demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject and presents a persuasive argument. By focusing on precision in language, developing your arguments more fully, and refining your conclusion, you will be able to produce an even stronger and more coherent essay.

4622,https://essayforum.com/writing/application-moot-club-banning-wearing-hijab-80675/,dev,APPLICATION FOR THE MOOT CLUB - THE BANNING OF WEARING HIJAB IN EUROPE COUNTRIES,"The infringement of religious freedom has provoked acid controversies among nations. Hijab considered as the specific-partition clothing of Muslim women has been banned strictly in Europe countries. To my mind, this decree actually trespasses the human right of religion to a remarkable degree. \n In the theoretical view, this banning does not conform to religious freedom law, which is commonly known as one of the most fundamental human rights. Deeply, it relates directly to individual actions that government's permission even with nations having state religion to treat equally with all type of belief depending on personal religion wishes. In practice, some countries have enforced policies to the foreign belief including punitive taxation and limits in practicing belief outwardly in a public manner. On the one hand, it is true that different religions will display in varied forms and we must control their influences on citizens by law. But more importantly, these signs need classifying whether they are detrimental or inoffensive. On the other hand, the hijab is a type of women's clothing so it superficially harmless other than its manifested function of Muslim women's seclusion from men in the public sphere. Hijab is the symbolic expression of the modest-style fashion and social status rather than a fuse to terrorism. \n France, the first Europe country banning the full-face veil in public spaces has shown the contrary. It passed a law banning symbols or clothes through which students conspicuously display their religious affiliation in schools, which harshly smashes both student's freedom of religion and perception. Due to one student's developed phase, he must know about religious symbols beside his national belief and aware of his liberal rights of religion as well as handicap decree-law. \n In the victims' viewpoint, there are two objects affected adversely. The majority is women who are delicate and have frail-suffering abilities. This banning has put unofficial pressure on those wearing hijab including physical attacks. Consequently, some women stop wearing it out of fear or out of religious conviction for self-protection. Moreover, their legal rights have been infringed as women's belief displays are considered as an open society. Futhermore, Europe's banning decree will constrain their citizens' culture-exchanging opportunities and religious freedom, which can easily trigger more domestic demonstrations. \n In conclusion, a religion-protecting strategy should be applied as opposed to an anti-diverse culture policy to reduce ethnic conflicts among nations. This method with educated orientation will reduce assimilation in a better way without raising more controversial problems.","Dear student, I believe that you should be arguing this case from the point of view of the separation of church and state. The state is not allowed to look into religious matters by the constitution and therefore, the government should not be banning the hijab as that is a representative of religious freedom in the country. As such, it is the religious rights of the person that is infringed upon. A right that is protected by the constitution and should therefore be respected as a part of their basic human rights. Your discussion does not really lay a clear legal foundation for your claims as you seem to be basing it on religious practice as opposed to religious freedoms that have been protect both directly and indirectly by the separation of church and state. \n It will be better for your essay is you look into precedents for this discussion (if any). Look into news reports coming out of France related to the enforcement of the hijab rule and consider the legalities being presented in the discussion. Based on your new information, you should be able to come up with a more legal versed and acceptable discussion as opposed to your current public and personal opinion discussion. You need to gain a better understanding of the law that France is trying to enforce and what actual previous laws it may be violating in the country when it comes to religious freedom.","The essay does address the assigned topic, focusing on the controversy surrounding the ban on the hijab in European countries and its implications for religious freedom. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the argument presented.

1. **Clarity and Coherence:** The essay's main argument—that the ban infringes on religious freedom—is clear, but the presentation could be more coherent. Organize the essay into clear sections: introduction, argument, examples, and conclusion. Each paragraph should introduce one main idea, supported by examples or evidence, and then conclude how it supports your overall thesis. This structure will make your argument more persuasive and easier to follow.

2. **Legal Foundation and Argumentation:** The essay would benefit from a stronger legal foundation in its arguments. Instead of mainly focusing on the angle of religious practice, it's crucial to delve into the constitutional protection of religious freedoms and the separation of church and state. Researching and incorporating legal precedents and specific laws relevant to religious freedom, especially those that may be in conflict with the hijab ban, would make your argument more compelling and grounded. You might particularly want to explore how the ban could violate constitutional protections of religious freedom in the countries you are discussing.

3. **Use of Examples:** The examples provided, such as the situation in France, are relevant, but they need to be developed further. For each example mentioned, include specifics about how the law was implemented, public reactions, and any legal challenges or debates that arose. This information will help to substantiate your argument and provide a clearer picture of the implications of such bans.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are several grammatical and stylistic errors throughout the essay, such as inconsistent use of tense, awkward phrasing (""deeply, it relates directly""), and spelling errors (""Futhermore""). Proofreading and revising your work for clarity, proper grammar, and spelling will significantly improve the readability of your essay. Consider using simpler language to express your ideas, as this will make your essay more accessible to a broader audience, including those who are still learning English.

5. **Point of View and Descriptive Arguments:** While your point of view is clear, it could be strengthened by making your arguments more descriptive and specific. For instance, when discussing the impact of the hijab ban on women, detail the psychological and social consequences, using specific examples or anecdotal evidence. This approach will make your position more persuasive and relatable to the reader.

In summary, by reorganizing your essay for clarity, deepening your legal arguments, elaborating on examples, correcting linguistic errors, and specifying your arguments, your essay will become a much stronger and more compelling piece of writing. Remember, a well-argued essay is clear, coherent, legally informed, well-supported with examples, and free from language errors.",3,3,3,4,4,3,2,4,4,1,Argumentative
4623,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-think-children-studying-mandatory-76758/,dev,[IELTS]Some people think that children should be studying all the mandatory subjects,"Some people believe children before ten years old could choose the subjects what they are interested because it's the best to learn anything. However, in my perspective, children should learn mandatory subjects firstly and then they have more choices to select the favorite subjects in the future. \n Young children have great learning abilities to obtain knowledge quickly. Instead of spending time on what they are interested, they should focus on general subjects such as mathematics, language, science, history, and geography. Knowing how the world works is important to prepare them to communicate and cooperate with other people. For instance, a child just likes to study math but he abandons language course. Although he is extremely talented in math, he couldn't find a job because of lack of communication skills. If they don't study basic subject such as geography, they don't even know the geography their own country and even the whole picture of the world. How do they survive without basic knowledge? \n In majority children, they don't know their favorite subjects so learning mandatory subjects is great access to inspire the main stuffs they would like to develop. Nevertheless, if the children have passion on specific subjects, there are lots of methods to approach it. Firstly, they can take up after class time to study it. Secondly, joining some school's clubs is a way to extend their enthusiasm. Finally, consolidation on basic knowledge is beneficial for them to get more selection in the future. \n In summary, compared to select the favorite subjects, studying mandatory provide more opportunities for children when they are in the age they can choose.","Dear student, when it comes to presenting the paraphrased discussion of the essay, I can say that you did a poor job on it. That is because you did not follow the rudimentary requirements of the opening statement which are: \n 1. A proper paraphrasing of the prompt based upon your understanding of the discussion topic; \n 2. The discussion requirement of the prompt; \n 3. The type of discussion you are expected to present. \n An example is: \n <em>There is a school of thought that believes that children should study only mandatory subjects until the age of ten. However, there are some who believe that the students should be given the option to study only their selected favorite subjects. In this essay, I will be discussing my opinion regarding my opinion on the topic using supporting examples from my personal experience.</em> \n Now, in the essay body, you decided to discuss a compare and contrast essay instead of an opinion essay. That is not the correct approach. Based on the prompt instruction, you were only supposed to discuss your personal opinion from the very start, using the body paragraphs to support your opinion. Now, because you did not present the required discussion, the essay that you wrote will show that you did not understand the discussion instructions. Therefore, your essay will not get a passing score in the end. The minute you fail the task accuracy portion, that is based upon your ability to understand English instructions, there is no possibility that you can pass this test.","Your essay attempts to address an important topic: whether children should be allowed to choose their subjects or focus on mandatory subjects until a certain age. However, there are several areas where it can be improved to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay has somewhat strayed from the specific requirement of discussing your personal opinion on the subject. It seems to compare and contrast different perspectives rather than focusing on explaining and supporting your own view. For example, instead of simply stating the opposing viewpoint in the introduction, clarify your position from the beginning and throughout the essay. A clearer statement of your argument, such as ""In this essay, I will argue that children should focus on mandatory subjects first, which I believe provides a more solid foundation for their future learning,"" would help align your essay more closely with the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few areas that need attention. For instance:
   - The phrase ""the subjects what they are interested"" should be ""the subjects they are interested in.""
   - ""Children should learn mandatory subjects firstly"" could be better phrased as ""Children should first learn mandatory subjects.""
   - Watch out for singular and plural agreements and preposition use.
   - Consider using varied sentence structures to make your essay more engaging.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: While your stance is mentioned, it’s somewhat buried under comparisons rather than being clearly and strongly presented. Strengthen your point of view by directly stating it in the introduction and conclusion, and focusing each body paragraph on supporting this view with clear arguments and examples.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You provide some examples and reasoning, but they could be sharpened. For instance, when you discuss the importance of learning basic subjects, including specific, relatable examples could enhance your argument. Instead of the hypothetical scenario about a child not finding a job due to a lack of communication skills, a real-world example or more detailed hypothetical scenario could provide stronger support for your argument.

Additionally, incorporating feedback into the structure of your essay can significantly improve its clarity and persuasiveness. Begin with a clear introduction that outlines your opinion, followed by body paragraphs that each focus on a different argument supporting your point of view, and conclude with a summary that reinforces your stance.

Overall, your essay presents a valid point of view but needs refinement in structure, clarity, and focus to better meet the requirements of an opinion essay as expected in English proficiency tests.

This essay will analyze the reasons and gives solutions to this grave issue. \n It is undeniable that the insufficient ability to restrain emotions is one-factor giving rise to students to abuse another. Yet pupils are not fully developed, they are undergoing the period of pubescence and are incapable of self-soothing, the injuries are irrevocable on their mates. Furthermore, those who are brought up in a dysfunctional family or shortage the affection from their parents are more prone to lease out the trauma by repeating the same things they had to go through on others as a sign of impotence. Take a case in Hung Yen as an example, the bullies are all living afar from their parents, they have no one to breathe down on their neck since the first day of their birth, it is no bizarre they bully as pride and joy. \n Actions must be taken promptly to solve this problem. It is worth considering to enhance students of self-consciousness about the degree to which bully affects for all intents and purposes by opening extracurricular classes and let parents be involved in. In these classes, ensure that pupils are taught in-depth of the outcome that bully brings about. At the same time, modifying the schools' regulation, make it more rigorous and thorough so that no one can bend the regulation, make such a mess in an educational environment. \n To conclude, society should pay more attention to students' life and put an end to the violence increasingly occurring.","Your opening paraphrase suffers from improper topic rephrasing and being unable to respond directly to the questions posed by the original prompt.

A more accurate paraphrase: \n <em>While academic insitutions are seen as safe havens for students to develop their intellect and other person skills, the reality is that assaults on the learners while at the institution of learning is increasing. Based on the experience of various students, they believe that one of the reasons that this seems to be happening is because of bullying in schools. Their proposed solution to this problem is the creation of anti tormenter programs in the halls of learning.</em>","The essay begins with an attempt to address the prompt but struggles to directly answer the question or clearly outline the main points to be discussed. It’s essential to start with a clear statement that directly responds to the question and then outline the main arguments or points that will be discussed in the essay. This helps in establishing a clear direction for your essay and ensures that the reader understands what to expect.

In terms of structure, each paragraph should focus on a specific point. The second paragraph could explore a particular reason for the problem discussed, supported by a clear explanation or example. The third paragraph should then propose a solution relevant to the reason outlined previously, drawing from personal experience or observations. This structured approach ensures that each section of the essay contributes to the overall argument and makes your points clearer to the reader.

The use of “we” in the original prompt indicates that the essay should adopt a collective perspective. To maintain consistency with this approach, it's advisable to use plural first-person pronouns throughout the essay. This not only aligns with the prompt’s instructions but also fosters a sense of inclusivity and collective responsibility in addressing the issue at hand.

It's important to closely adhere to the topic mentioned in the prompt. The focus on bullying, while related to the broader issue of safety in educational institutions, was not explicitly mentioned in the given question. A more direct approach might involve discussing general safety concerns, including but not limited to bullying, and suggesting comprehensive solutions that address the issue holistically.

From a language perspective, there are several areas for improvement. The essay contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as “the extent to which the victims are undergone by bullying has also more become severely.” Consider simplifying the language to make your points more clearly and directly. For instance, “bullying victims are increasingly suffering severe consequences.” 

Additionally, it would be beneficial to refine arguments and proposed solutions with clear, logical explanations and relevant examples. Instead of vague suggestions, offer specific, actionable recommendations and illustrate them with concrete examples or personal experiences.

In summary, the essay would benefit from a clearer introduction that directly addresses the prompt, a more organized structure, consistent use of plural first-person pronouns, closer adherence to the topic, and improved language clarity.

Others opine that their salary is adequate. Personally, I would argue that both of these stances have their own plus and minus sides. \n On the one hand, to some extent, some sportspeople are paid more than what they deserve. Undoubtedly, sports are not the only occupation which requires high payments. Other professions indeed assert sufficient commissions as well, since they make as vital contributions to the society as sports do. Such people as meteorologists, astronomers and researchers all need ample funding to maintain their work conditions. Were sports to be prioritized in investment, other fields would not obtain their satisfactory budget. Hence, the society would suffer from fewer findings and discoveries. \n On the other hand, I believe the uplifted salaries spent on experts in sports are justifiable. To begin with, this line of work is a physically demanding and exhausting job. Footballers, boxers,.. are all in need of high salaries in compensation for all the protracted practice and endurance they experience. In addition, intensive sporting is unfailingly involved with occasional injuries. In order to make amends for these sprains as well as hospital cost implications, sport specialists are undoubtedly longing for superb paying conditions. Therefore, the high expenditure on expert sportdoers is understandable. \n All in all, I am in favor of the viewpoint that the plentiful financial provision for trained sportsmen is plausible due to their suffering from harsh physical compulsions and frequent body bruises. \n (252 words)","Dear student, In this type of essay, you should be looking to discuss both points of view from a public perspective rather than a personal observation.

A combination of an understanding of the two points of view are what will then create your personal opinion on the matter. \n While your essay response is somewhat okay, the fact that the prompt restatement is incomplete and your discussion is lacking a proper public points of view discussion for the two opinions before your own drag down your presentation.

However, there are several areas for improvement to effectively respond to the essay topic and enhance overall clarity and impact.

1. **Topic Responsiveness and Structure**: The essay partially addresses the topic but could improve by discussing public points of view rather than focusing solely on personal observations. Discussing the two contrasting public opinions in detail before introducing your own view can create a more balanced and informative essay. Aim to structure the essay more clearly by introducing the topic, presenting the two public viewpoints, and then stating your own opinion based on these discussions.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the essay is quite readable, but attention to sentence structure and word choice can enhance clarity. Avoid ellipsis (""…"") and use full words instead of abbreviations or symbols. Also, varying sentence structure can make the essay more engaging for readers. 

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While your opinion becomes clear by the conclusion, integrating it more smoothly with the discussion of public opinions will strengthen the essay. Explicitly stating how the public discussions lead to your viewpoint can add clarity and coherence to your argument.

4. **Arguments and Descriptiveness**: The essay presents arguments for both sides but lacks depth in explanation and development. For each viewpoint, include examples, consequences, and more detailed reasoning to support the claims. This approach will strengthen your arguments and make the essay more persuasive.

5. **Word Count and Development**: The essay's length is on the lower end for this type of prompt. Expanding the discussion to include more comprehensive exploration of each viewpoint, as well as integrating your personal stance more seamlessly, will enrich the content. Targeting a length of 275-300 words can allow for more detailed discussion and clearer presentation of ideas.

6. **Language Use and Development**: Continuously working on vocabulary and sentence structure will naturally improve language fluency over time. Practice is key; as you write more, you'll find your ability to express complex ideas in English improving. Focusing on one topic or idea at a time and using connecting words or phrases can help guide the reader through your discussion more effectively.

In summary, the essay has a good foundation but needs further development in terms of structure, argument depth, and language use.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay exhibits a range of spelling, grammar, and stylistic inaccuracies that can obscure the intended meaning and weaken the argument. For instance, there are instances of tense inconsistency, singular/plural agreement errors (""problems of the unemployers""), and misspellings. Phrases like ""banning smoking had better implementing"" could be revised to ""banning smoking would be better if implemented."" Simplifying sentences and using tools to check for grammar and spelling can aid in making the essay clearer and more professional.

3. **Clarity of Author’s Point of View:** The essay does make the author’s stance clear – in support of banning smoking. To strengthen this, it's beneficial to directly state the thesis at the beginning and reiterate it in the conclusion, ensuring the reader is aware of the stance throughout the essay.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay attempts to present arguments for and against smoking but lacks depth and specificity in supporting the author’s position. Each point introduced needs to be fully developed with explanations, examples, or evidence that directly ties back to the author’s main argument. For example, instead of merely stating that tobacco has positive aspects, detail what those are and counter them with specific, well-researched negative impacts, reinforcing why the negative outweighs the positive.

To improve the essay, consider the following actions:
- Start with a clear thesis statement that reflects your position on the topic.
- Organize your essay with focused paragraphs: one for the introduction, at least two for body paragraphs presenting arguments and evidence, and one for the conclusion.
- Develop each point with specific examples, facts, or reasons that clearly support your stance.
- Use transitional phrases to link ideas smoothly between sentences and paragraphs.
- Proofread carefully to fix grammar, spelling, and style issues.

Remember, the strength of an essay lies not just in presenting arguments but in how convincingly you can support them with clear, coherent, and well-structured writing.",2,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4628,https://essayforum.com/writing/cheap-tourism-93669/,dev,IELTS WRITING TASK 2: CHEAP TOURISM,"The prices of traveling internationally have been decreasing greatly, resulting in more opportunities for tourists to travel everywhere. From my perspectives, this trend is rather beneficial than disastrous regarding several aspects. \n One evident drawback of inexpensive global tourism is more destruction to the environment. Specifically, tourism industry has already been considered to be the major cause of global warming, as it provokes the use of cars, buses and planes that employ non-renewable energy such petrol and release toxic fumes into the atmosphere. Furthermore, not every traveler has environmental awareness, since they believe that it is not their responsibility to protect the environment, leading to many places of interests around the world being covered in trash. Therefore, based on the two reasons above, I claim that the environment will be harshly ruined due ti the rise in tourism. \n Notwithstanding, I am of opinion that the growth in tourism gives plentiful benefits to people. First, the employment rates will rapidly skyrocket as more tourism-related jobs such as pilots, tour guides and flight attendants will be increasingly demanded. Second, the locals will intensely benefit from this, because they can open family-owned restaurants or hotels providing services, which affects them positively financially. Finally, the visitors themselves, especially the young, will be able to travel exclusively and frequently without worrying about the costs. They will have the chance to explore the wonders of the world as well as witness various countries' traditions and culture in practice. Hence, the experiences they obtain during the journeys will make them knowledgeable. \n In conclusion, although the decrease in the costs of global touri is unfavorable, it is overshadowed by the strength humans get.","The writer has taken an incorrect approach to the discussion. This is actually a comparison essay based upon the discussion question provided. That means the writer should be discussing both the advantage and disadvantage in each of the two reasoning paragraphs. The writer should disprove that the perceived disastrous result actually has potential, misunderstood, or unconsidered benefits. For every disadvantage presented, it should have an alternate believable advantage presentation. That is what the writing instruction is all about and that is what should be presented in the paragraphs. \n The current presentation lacks the aforementioned cohesive presentation as required by the prompt. The writer should spend more time on analyzing what the question is actually asking him to write about so that he can use the higher scoring writing format.","The essay provides an analysis of the impact of decreasing travel costs on global tourism, presenting both beneficial and detrimental effects. However, to further improve the essay, consider the following points:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay partially addresses the topic but misses the mark in terms of structure. It appears that the task requires a comparison within each argument, showing both sides (advantages and disadvantages) directly against each other. It would be more effective to discuss an advantage and its corresponding disadvantage side by side in each paragraph, rather than separating them. This approach will align more closely with the expected comparison essay format.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are minor grammatical errors that need attention. For example, ""From my perspectives,"" could be revised to ""From my perspective,"" for grammatical consistency. Also, the transition between ideas can be smoother. Consider using more linking words and phrases to help the reader follow your arguments more easily. Additionally, the term ""petrol"" in the context used is a bit narrow, considering the global nature of the topic; ""fossil fuels"" might be a more encompassing term.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** Your viewpoint is clear, but the reasoning behind it can be enhanced by directly contrasting the pros and cons within the same thematic paragraph. Make your stance evident by not just listing the benefits and drawbacks but by also evaluating these points against each other to show a more nuanced understanding of the topic.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While you present arguments for both benefits and drawbacks, intertwining these discussions will make your position stronger. For every negative aspect mentioned, try to find a potential positive angle to it, and vice versa. This method will provide a more balanced and thorough analysis of the subject matter. For instance, when discussing environmental harm caused by tourism, also explore how increased awareness and funding can lead to better conservation efforts as a result of tourism.

To polish your essay, dive deeper into the prompt to ensure your structure aligns with the expectations of a comparison essay. This will not only clarify your arguments but also showcase your ability to critically analyze and objectively weigh both sides of an issue. Remember, refining your essay is an iterative process, and focusing on these aspects will significantly enhance your writing.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay does endeavor to discuss how adults influence young people's behavior, which is relevant to the prompt. However, the introduction of the topic as ""hotly-debated"" might not accurately represent the nature of the discussion.

Adjusting the framing of the topic to match its real-world perception could strengthen your essay's foundation.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several areas where spelling and grammatical errors detract from the clarity and professionalism of your essay.

For starters, you seem to have a problem keeping count. You always start out with ""Firstly"", skip ""Secondly"", and go directly to ""Thirdly"" every single time you try to count out your discussion points. It would be best if you simply avoid counting altogether and just separate the discussion points by using a new paragraph for every topic you wish to discuss. The transition from paragraph to paragraph is a bit choppy. Use transition sentences at the end of paragraphs to create a smoother paragraph presentation for the reader from one paragraph to the next.","The essay provided offers a balanced discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of moving abroad, clearly responding to the topic and presenting a well-considered view on the matter. The argument is structured around the benefits and challenges of living in a foreign country, including opportunities for personal growth and potential difficulties such as homesickness and cultural misunderstandings. This approach helps in presenting a nuanced perspective, which is commendable.

However, there are several areas that require attention to improve the overall quality of the essay:

1. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: The essay has some grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that hinder clarity. Paying closer attention to grammar rules and sentence structure can significantly enhance the readability and coherence of the essay.

2. **Use of Sequential Markers**: The essay attempts to organize points sequentially by using ""Firstly"" and ""Thirdly"" but misses ""Secondly."" This creates confusion in the flow of arguments. It may be more effective to forgo numerical markers and instead start a new paragraph for each point. This approach could eliminate counting errors and make the essay more straightforward.

3. **Transitions between Paragraphs**: The transition between paragraphs appears abrupt at times, which can disrupt the flow of reading. Implementing smoother transitions can help create a better connection from one paragraph to the next. Consider adding transition sentences that summarize the previous paragraph and introduce the next topic. This will help in maintaining a logical and fluid progression of ideas throughout the essay.

I totally agree with this idea. \n Firstly, researches carried out by governments have much high quality than by private companies. Governments have sufficient equipment and human resources to do any professional research. For example, universities are organizations that have enough conditions to do research. Most universities have a lot of scientists who have experience in researching scientific works. \n Besides, scientific researches made by private companies are probably not exact at all times. All companies that do research do not have the same quality. There may be a lot of organizations that do not have enough conditions to carry out a research. Therefore, these organizations can bring some flawed results of their research. In addition, the aim of private companies often is profits. In some cases, in order to maximize profits, some companies tend to cut the necessary costs to implement research. This may lead to the fact that scientific research is not carried out with full steps. Therefore, there may be a blank in the results. \n Opposing views claim that private companies should carry out and control scientific findings is beneficial to some extent. Admittedly, private companies can make a variety of research. Moreover, private companies have more chances to make people contribute money to do research. Nevertheless, this stance fails to recognize the belief of people in the scientific research of private companies.

This alignment with the topic shows an understanding of the assignment. However, improvement across several areas would enhance your essay’s effectiveness and adhere to English proficiency standards.

1. **Essay Structure**: Your essay extends beyond the recommended structure for this type of prompt. Typically, for a non-comparative opinion piece, two reasoning paragraphs suffice to present your argument effectively. Your current approach risks underdeveloping your points due to spreading them thin across too many paragraphs. Focus on deepening your argument within a more streamlined structure. This conciseness aids in clarity and strength of the argument.

2. **Topic Sentences**: Each paragraph should open with a single, clear topic sentence. This practice guides the reader through your argument without confusion or overcomplication. Your essay occasionally diverges into multiple ideas per paragraph, diluting the impact of each point. By limiting yourself to one main idea per paragraph supported with detailed evidence, your argument becomes more persuasive and easier to follow.

3. **Response to the Prompt**: In responding to prompts that do not ask ""to what extent,"" it's critical to match your response format to the question asked. Your essay leans towards an ""extent"" response, which isn't aligned with the straightforward agree/disagree structure of the prompt. Adhering closely to the prompt ensures your essay meets the expectations and doesn't diverge into unnecessary exaggeration.

4. **Language Use**: There are several issues with grammar, clarity, and conciseness across your essay. These can distract from your message and reduce the overall effectiveness of your argument. Aim to simplify and clarify your sentences. Removing redundancies and choosing more precise words strengthens your essay. For example, ""researches"" should be ""research"" as it's uncountable in this context.

5. **Paraphrasing and Concluding**: Both your introductory and concluding paragraphs need further development. Ideally, aim to include at least three sentences: restating the topic, summarizing your stance, and briefly outlining your reasons. This approach not only clarifies your position but also reinforces your argument, presenting it in a rounded, cohesive manner.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to explore both sides of the argument regarding team sports. However, it lacks a clear stance from the author. In an essay, it's essential to not only compare different viewpoints but also to clearly express your own opinion in relation to these views.

Be cautious with verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and the use of articles (""the"", ""a"", ""an""). Also, use more precise vocabulary to express your thoughts clearly. For example, ""children wanna prevent"" could be revised to ""parents wish to avoid"". Carefully proofread your essay to correct such errors.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** The essay does not clearly distinguish between public opinions and the author's personal point of view. This is crucial for the reader to understand where your argument stands in relation to others. Use first-person pronouns (""I"", ""my"") when presenting your viewpoint to avoid confusion.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay mentions some arguments for and against team sports, these points need to be developed further. Provide specific examples or evidence to support your claims, making your argument more persuasive. Instead of stating broad generalizations, delve deeper into how team sports specifically contribute to or hinder career success in children. 

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion lacks the depth needed to effectively summarize the discussion and reiterate the author's stance. A strong conclusion should revisit the key arguments made and clearly state your viewpoint again. Aim for at least three sentences in your conclusion, ensuring it reflects the discussion and provides a clear ending to your essay.

To a certain extend I totally agree that prevention is better than cure since there are enormous benefits whether inhabitants' health condition is widely promoted by effective national policies. \n To begin with, the more government money spending on enhancing the healthy lifestyle, the more quality of life in the general population improves. This upgrade could bring in a decrease of mobility and mortality rate of not only infectious diseases but also noninfectious diseases. Therefore, it could save a huge amount of expenditure for patients undergoing medical treatment as well as for funeral expenses whether they pass away.

This is a commendable focus and aligns with the essay topic effectively. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, accuracy, and overall effectiveness.

First, the phrase ""To a certain extend I totally agree"" combines expressions that contradict each other. ""To a certain extent"" suggests partial agreement, whereas ""totally agree"" indicates full agreement. To improve clarity and present a coherent viewpoint, it's important to choose one that accurately reflects your position. For instance, if the belief is strong and without reservations, ""I completely agree"" would be more appropriate.

Second, the misuse of words and phrases detracts from the essay's clarity. For instance, ""enormous benefits"" is a vague expression that could be made more impactful by specifying the types of benefits or their significance. Similarly, the use of ""whether"" instead of ""when,"" such as in ""for funeral expenses whether they pass away,"" confuses the meaning. ""When"" is the correct choice here since it relates to the time of an event, not an alternative scenario. Accurate word choice is crucial for clear communication.

Additionally, there's confusion between ""mobility"" and ""morbidity."" ""Mobility"" refers to the ability to move freely, whereas ""morbidity"" is about the occurrence of diseases. The intended meaning appears to be related to ""morbidity rates,"" so ensuring the correct terminology is used will significantly improve understanding. 

The essay could also benefit from more detailed examples and clearer arguments to support the viewpoint. While mentioning the cost of insulin pens versus the cost of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is good, expanding on such examples with more details or including additional instances could strengthen the argument. This could also involve citing specific studies or statistics to back up claims, making the argument more persuasive.

In conclusion, focusing on clear and accurate expression, ensuring correct word usage, and expanding on arguments with detailed examples would enhance the essay significantly. The stance taken is clear and relevant to the topic, but refining these aspects would significantly improve the overall effectiveness and coherence of the essay.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. \n In all countries, the government always plays an important role in medical development. However, it can be seen that governments' resources are not unlimited, so their investigation in healthcare should not be wasteful. As a result, some people argue that inspite of making a great effort to cure illness, governments should focus more on introducing disease-preventing solutions. In my opinion, this statement could be partially agreed because of the following reasons. \n Firstly, if people could be prevented from catching a disease, the treatment for that disease would not need using. Some illnesses can be easily prevented thanks to changing living condition or lifestyle. For example, myopia can be prevented by providing enough light for work and having a proper sitting posture. Governments can encourage this by raising public awareness. Many diseases have had useful and specific prevention such as vaccines. Treatment cost usually higher than the cost of prevention. Trying more to introduce that prevention to community helps to reduce the number of sick people, thereby reducing the cost of treatment. As a result, money can be saved. Through disease prevention, people's health can be improved in an economical and effective way, that is why governments should spend more resources developing healthcare resolutions which can prevent illness. \n On the other hand, there is no way to prevent all health failures. It is difficult to find the causes as well as prevention of many diseases. If their treatments are not paid enough attention, there may be more treatment failure, more incurable diseases and more patients who might become weaker and even die due to illness. In order to gain the best achievement in medical care, governments should also invest enough to develop and introduce therapeutical cures. \n To sum up, although disease prevention is an effective solution to improve public health, accessiblity of people to illness treatments is also important. Depending on each country's disease structure, epidemiological characteristics and the situation of national budget as well as other resources, its government should pay attention and make an effective attempt to introduce both illness-preventing healthcare solutions and cures in the most reasonable way.","Hang, your reasons are well developed and presented well in the essay. You have managed to present both supporting arguments and examples that people can easily understand and identify with. It is obvious that you gave much thought and care to the development of this essay. I do hope that you remembered to used a timer set to 40 minutes for the writing of this essay though. What I mean is that you should be able to write a similarly polished essay within the given time frame during the actual test as well. Make sure you always have that timer on when you write these practice tests to better prepare you for exam day. \n Being a direct question essay, you were given a chance to actually begin the discussion of this essay in the opening statement. Unfortunately, your chosen format for the presentation of your answer was more for an emotional / measured extent essay rather than the direct question essay. If I had written this opening paraphrase I would have worded it as follows: \n <em>There is a discussion as to whether or not governments have the responsibility of providing health assistance that blocks the development of illnesses rather than healing the people who are already sick. I agree with this statement to the extent that the government does have a responsibility to help keep their citizens healthy by making sure they have adequate healthcare to cure them when they are sick. However, a government that has preventive measures when it comes to illnesses is, in my opinion, the better option.</em> \n In a direct question essay, you need to be able to showcase your ability to paraphrase the prompt while also offering a clear response to the question that you can further develop in the upcoming 3 body paragraphs. That is what I accomplished in the above example. \n Do not use the counting system of presenting your discussions if you will not follow through on it in the succeeding paragraphs. In this essay, you lost cohesiveness in your presentation because you opened the second paragraph with ""firstly"" then, in the next paragraph you used ""on the other hand"" instead of the more appropriate ""Secondly."" That is because you changed the topic of the next discussion to one that does not relate to the first discussion. Hence the improper transitioning of the paragraph. You don't always have to count out of compare your discussion sentences in the first paragraph. It is better to always open with a topic sentence reference for the discussion instead. That way you avoid using word fillers (e.g. firstly, on the other hand) and instead, go direct to the point of the paragraph discussion which will help you create a more coherent discussion. \n You have a good concluding summary that was only marred by the lack of comma usage when you presented the series of unrelated considerations. These considerations are unrelated to one another but fall under the same discussion topic so the use of comma's should have been reflected. It should have been structured as : \n <em>... disease structure, epidemiological characteristics, the situation of the national budget, AND other resources.</em> \n Overall, I believe your essay can garner a score between 5.5 - 6 depending on the other considerations the examiner may have for your essay presentation.","The essay thoughtfully addresses the topic, effectively outlining the balance between preventive healthcare measures and the necessity for treatment options. The arguments are well-articulated, providing a balanced view that considers both prevention and cure. The inclusion of examples, such as the reference to myopia prevention, adds a practical dimension that enhances the essay's persuasiveness. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to elevate the essay's overall quality and coherence.

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay engages with the topic, the introduction could be more direct in stating the opinion. A clearer stance in the opening paragraph would more effectively set the stage for the arguments that follow. Instead of a generalized opening, consider directly addressing the question with a succinct thesis statement that previews your stance and the reasons behind it.

2. **Structural and Stylistic Issues**: The use of ""firstly"" in beginning the argument suggests a structured list of points will follow, yet this structure gets lost as the essay progresses. For greater coherence, it is advisable to avoid signaling a numbered list unless this structure is consistently followed. Moving directly to each argument with topic sentences could enhance clarity and flow.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Viewpoint**: The viewpoint is clear, showing a balanced approach to the issue. However, ensuring that the introduction directly states this balanced view will reinforce the clarity of the perspective from the beginning.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The arguments presented are compelling and supported by logical explanations and relatable examples. To strengthen these arguments further, ensure a smoother transition between contrasting viewpoints, such as shifting from the importance of prevention to the necessity of treatment options. This could be achieved through more cohesive transition phrases that better link these contrasting ideas.

5. **Grammatical and Punctuation Corrections**: Attention to grammatical details and punctuation is crucial for improving readability and professionalism. Specifically, the correct use of commas in series and avoiding common errors, such as the misuse of ""inspite"" (should be written as ""in spite""), can make a significant difference. Ensuring accurate grammar and punctuation throughout will support the essay's effectiveness and make the arguments more persuasive.

6. **Timed Practice**: As a practical suggestion, practicing writing essays within a set time frame can greatly benefit preparation for timed exams. This will help in developing the ability to express clear and coherent arguments under time constraints, which is a valuable skill for exam success.

In summary, the essay demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the topic, backed by logical arguments and practical examples. Focusing on a clearer expression of the thesis statement, maintaining structural coherence, and polishing grammar and punctuation will significantly enhance the essay's quality. With these improvements, the essay has the potential to achieve a higher score, reflecting a well-reasoned and effectively communicated argument.",3,4,3,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

Some people think that every crime have to be punished in accordance to the regulations. In contrast, others believe that the consideration of the crime background is an important aspect when making a punishment. Personally, every crime that happened should be investigated before giving a judgement. Because every people deserve to get a justice \n Regarding to human rights, we have to find out the motivation of criminals when commit a crime before giving a punishment. For instance, husband killed his sister-in-law when he came to her house. Due to the accident, he must get into the prison. But, when police look out the reason why he did it, they found that he has a mental illness. Automatically, He cannot get the fixed punishment based on the type of crime that he did \n On the other hand, others who believe that every crime should be punished based on applicable law, did not care about themotivation of the crime. Every person who did the same crime, must be justice as a standard punishment. For instance, the penalty of the every killer who planned its murder is 20 years in prison. So, every teenagers or adults does not matter. They have to convicted in the same way \n All in all, i personally think that each crime should be investigated specifically and should be punished according to the appropriate judgement. We have to consider the reason why they commit crimes because it is the human rights. However, the judgement should be held righteously.","Ifra, you would not score better than a 4 with this essay. While you did attempt to discuss the prompt in the best way that you could, you just failed to keep track of the discussion so that you could present the discussion points in a clear, coherent, and acceptable manner. You have difficulty in developing proper paragraph sentences because you lose sight of the all too important topic sentences that dictate the discussion tone of the paragraph. You must also learn to spellcheck because you have a number of misspelled words in the essay that, while it doesn't affect what you are trying to say, since the reader can guess the correct word, distracts from the true meaning of what you are trying to convey to the reader. I hope that you will be able to take note of the problem areas I pointed out. I am looking forward to your next, improved essay very soon.","This essay engages with the topic by discussing different views on how crimes should be punished, focusing on whether the motivations behind the crimes should be considered. It's a strong starting point showing understanding of the debate. However, the essay would benefit from clearer organization and more precise language to enhance coherence and readability.

1. **Topic Response**: The essay addresses the question by presenting two perspectives on the issue of punishment for crimes, supporting the idea that the background and motivation of a crime should affect the punishment. This is a good approach. However, it's important to directly link these discussions back to the question throughout the essay to keep the argument focused.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are spelling errors and grammatical mistakes (e.g., ""controvercial"" should be ""controversial"", ""every crime have"" should be ""every crime has"", ""every people"" should be ""everyone"") that distract from the message. Also, the style can be improved by avoiding repetitions and using more varied vocabulary. Utilizing a spellchecker and revising sentences for clarity and variation will greatly improve the essay's quality.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The point of view is somewhat clear – advocating for individual investigation before judgment. However, it becomes more persuasive when explicitly stated at both the beginning and the conclusion to frame the discussion. It's important to state the position clearly and maintain this perspective consistently throughout the essay.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The essay provides examples to support the argument, such as the case of the husband with a mental illness. This is a good practice. However, the arguments would be stronger with more detailed descriptions and a clearer explanation of how these examples support the overall position. Also, discussing counterarguments more thoroughly could demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.

To improve, it would be helpful to:
- Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea.
- Use a spellchecker and carefully proofread for grammatical errors.
- Make the structure of the essay more apparent by grouping similar ideas together and transitioning smoothly between them.
- Enhance arguments with more detailed evidence and explanation, ensuring they clearly support the stance taken.

In contrast, other individuals espouse the idea that other measures would be more effecive in enhancing road safety. Both sides have, of course, their own merits, I think the first view is more resonable and this essay aims to prove my claim. \n First and foremost, strict punishments force habitants to follow right regulations. In other words, punishments have a direct influence on citizens' benefits, which is a good way to improve their awarenesses. For instance, according to Vietnamese governemtn's regulation, drivers having the level of acohols in their body will be punished more than 10,000,000 vnd, which is considered as a big ammount of money. As a result, this rule has an impact on the consumption of acohols drinks as well as helps to dicrease traffice accidents significantly. \n On the other hand, other measures such as the quality of road and, of course, would be effective ways to improve road safety. There is no doubt that the quality of road also has a lot of influences on road stafety. As roof, it is proved that wet surface of the road is considered as a cause resulting in a number of traffic accidents in comparision with the good quality of road. However, I still support myself that improving people's awarenesses that strict punnishments are key factors will bring more positive results to reduce traffic accidents. \n In conclusion, it is no denied the importance of other methods, the quality of road for example is a good ways to promote road safety. On the contrary, I firmly believe that strict publishments are main factors to reduce traffic problems.","The score for this essay will be lowered by the way that you chose to discuss the topic. For starters, you have actual cut and paste phrases from the original prompt (reducing traffic accidents, road safety.) You need to show an ability to use similar terms and phrases so that you can score well in the LR and GRA sections of the rubic. The vocabulary rand grammar / sentence presentation range will be seen in how well you can rephrase the original prompt. \n Next, You have to use the proper audience representative phrases to indicate that you are not yet discussing your personal opinion. Instead, the first and second paragraphs need to show that you are reviewing the public opinions in relation to your possible personal opinion. Terms such as ""Public support for"" or ""On the contrary, some road users lean more towards..."" Before saying ""I believe that..."" This mistakes have a direct effect on your TA score. This type of discussion will be considered as giving only a minimal response to the essay. \n Remember the concluding paragraph is a summary of the discussion. Restate the prompt, deliver the 2 points of view, then close with your personal opinion. That is how the essay should be ended. In this instance, your conclusion does not totally summarize the discussion you presented.","To enhance this essay and better address the topic, consider the following points to make the necessary improvements:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay tackles the debate between the effectiveness of strict punishments for driving offenses versus other safety measures. However, it's crucial to demonstrate a broader understanding of the issue by using varied vocabulary and different ways of expressing the ideas presented in the prompt. For example, instead of repeating phrases like ""reducing traffic accidents"" or ""road safety,"" try synonyms or related phrases to show diverse language skills.

2. **Language Use:** The essay suffers from spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that hinder clarity. For instance, ""punishments"" is misspelled as ""punnishments,"" and ""effective"" as ""effecive."" Pay attention to grammar rules and spelling to improve readability and accuracy. Consider using tools or resources to proofread and refine your work.

3. **Point of View:** To improve clarity about whose perspectives are being discussed (public opinions vs. personal belief), it's beneficial to use phrases that explicitly distinguish between public sentiment and your viewpoint. Before introducing your opinion with ""I believe,"" indicate the exploration of public opinions by using phrases like ""Public support for..."" or ""Some road users believe..."". This structure not only enhances clarity but also demonstrates an ability to engage with multiple perspectives before asserting your own.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay includes arguments like the influence of strict punishments on behavior, supported by an example from Vietnamese regulations. This is a strong point. However, ensure that when discussing counterarguments or additional measures (e.g., road quality), similar clarity and specificity in examples and reasoning are maintained. Additionally, while concluding, aim to succinctly summarize both points of view presented before reiterating your personal stance, to provide a coherent and comprehensive summary of the discussion.

5. **Conclusion:** The concluding paragraph needs a more effective summary. It's essential to restate the topic briefly, recapitulate the main points of discussion (including both views), and then clearly conclude with your personal opinion. This structure will ensure that your conclusion encapsulates the essence of your argument effectively.

Overall, focusing on these aspects will not only align the essay more closely with the topic but also showcase an advanced level of language proficiency and critical thinking.

4637,https://essayforum.com/writing/writting-universities-free-high-cost-77202/,dev,"[IELTS WRITTING TASK 2] Should universities be free? High cost of education, especially in Vietnam","free educational system \n Question: \n Students should pay the full cost of their own university studies, rather than have free higher education provided by the state. \n To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion. \n Answer: \n The topic of university fee remains controversial, as some people feel that students should finance their own studies, while others argue that higher education should be supported by the government. Personally, I believe that university should be free to all students. \n Firstly, the cost of education is much higher nowadays compare to the past, and this is especially true in Vietnam. Many students have to worry about the expense for accommodation, travel, textbooks,.. once they get into universities, and the high tuition fees will only exaggerate their financial problems. Not many are able to pursue their study without getting a job or applying for a loan, even if they get scholarships. This could greatly affect their study at schools, leading to poor results. Some may have no choice but to drop out, and in several cases, decide not to enter university at all. This situation only gives advantages to students with wealthy background, thus widen the already large gap between the rich and the poor. \n Secondly, investing in education will certainly benefit society and the economy greatly. A free education system creates more opportunity for students, and when they graduate, they will no doubt have more refined skills and become valuable workers. As they receive high salaries, they will pay more in taxes and spend more money on goods and services, which in turn contribute to the domestic economy. \n In conclusion, because of the many advantages of a free educational system, I am convinced that it is something we should try to achieve.","Hoa, your personal opinion statement at the end of the paraphrased paragraph should have been based upon the ""extent"" of your disagreement with the statement provided. In order to have properly reflected the original prompt, your work should have instead indicated: \n <em>There are some who believe that university education should be free to all since it can be provided by the state. Others believe that students must pay their way through college. I strongly disagree with the latter opinion for a number of reasons that I will be presenting in this essay.</em> \n You must always make sure to reflect the proper discussion instruction at the end of your paraphrase because that will prove that you understood the instructions provided for the completion of the essay. Now, since you strongly disagree with the latter opinion, your discussion that provides 2 paragraphs in support of that stance is just perfectly placed and developed. \n I would like to caution you though against using such a specific line of reasoning, such as Vietnam, in the discussion. If you are not asked to base your discussion on personal experience or knowledge, you will do better to just use general references in the presentation so that it will not matter whether or not the examiner is familiar with the educational system as it exists in Vietnam or any particular country. \n This is a good essay that was held back by the faulty opening statement. Hopefully you will learn how to better address the prompt topic and discussion requirements of that portion of the essay writing test over your forthcoming practice sessions.","Reflecting on the essay, it's clear that the discussion around the free educational system is approached with consideration and personal conviction. The essay primarily argues in favor of free university education, presenting a viewpoint against the proposition that students should bear the full cost of their university studies. Here's an evaluation based on the mentioned aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay does respond to the given topic but could be more aligned with the question's requirements. The prompt asks for the extent of agreement or disagreement with the opinion that students should pay for their university education rather than receiving it for free from the state. A more precise approach would be to explicitly state the extent of disagreement with the statement at the beginning, for example, ""I strongly disagree with the opinion that students should pay for their university education for several reasons outlined below."" This clarifies your stance and the direction of the essay right from the start.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the essay maintains a good standard of English. However, pay attention to minor details such as punctuation, especially the use of commas (e.g., ""... accommodation, travel, textbooks,.."") – the use of "".."" should be replaced with ellipses (""..."") if aiming to indicate continuation or a trailing off. Additionally, the essay could benefit from a more varied sentence structure to enrich its readability and impact.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The point of view is clear, with a consistent argument favoring the availability of free university education for all students. This position is supported by two main arguments concerning the economic barriers to education and the societal benefits of investing in education. However, explicitly stating disagreement at the beginning, as noted, would further clarify your point of view.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: The arguments provided are relevant and support the author's position well. The essay could be improved by broadening the argument beyond specific examples (like the mention of Vietnam) unless the question asks for personal experience or knowledge. Utilizing general references would make the argument more universally applicable and understandable, regardless of the reader's familiarity with specific educational systems.

In conclusion, strengthening the introductory statement to more directly address the essay prompt, refining grammatical precision, considering sentence variety for stylistic improvement, and broadening examples to be more inclusive would enhance the overall effectiveness of the essay.

There is no denying that many talents were discovered when they show their artwork or performed in front of their classmates and teachers. For instance, Hien Thuc is one of famous female singers who has developed the talent from music courses at school. \n Another reason why I agree with the madatory arts-based subjects is that the pupils can be trained a range of skills when they focus on learning these.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay firmly supports the incorporation of arts-based subjects in school curriculums to enhance academic results. To make your stance stronger, introduce a thesis statement early in the essay, summarizing your key reasons that will be detailed later. This will provide a solid base for your arguments and guide the reader through your thought process.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are a few spelling and grammatical errors in your essay, such as ""madatory"" instead of ""mandatory"" and ""puplis"" instead of ""pupils."" Also, the word ""persuade"" seems misplaced. Perhaps you meant ""pursue"" to indicate following a career in arts? Correcting these mistakes will improve the clarity and professionalism of your essay. Additionally, varying your sentence structure could make the essay more engaging to read.

3. **Author's Point of View:** Your point of view is clearly stated, which is excellent. However, it could be enriched by adding emotional depth. For instance, instead of simply agreeing with mandatory arts education, explain why this belief is important to you on a personal level or to society at large. This will make your argument more compelling and relatable.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your arguments supporting arts education are notable, especially mentioning the development of skills and showcasing talents like Hien Thuc's. To further strengthen your essay, ensure your examples are directly linked to your main thesis, illustrating how arts education contributes to academic and personal growth. Additionally, referencing studies is beneficial, but providing specific details or sources would enhance the credibility of your argument. 

5. **Conclusion:** In your conclusion, while summarizing your position is critical, remember to retain an objective tone. Avoid making decisions for the reader or indicating a collective action. Focus on reinforcing your viewpoint and why you believe arts education is vital, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions.

Some people believe that the problem can be solved by providing more schools and teachers, while others think that the problem can be solved by providing computers and Internet access. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. \n Answer: \n People have different views about whether investing in schools and teachers or supplying computers and Internet access should be taken to shorten the distance to education for children in rural areas. Personally, I side with the view that the latter is more affordable to achieve education for students in remote areas. \n There are various reasons why people believe that schools and teachers should be the focus to resolve the problem. They may assert that the insufficient teacher distribution in rural states causes the lack of instructors who help students go through the curriculum. When a teacher have to take care more students in a class, especially in a multi-grade class, students' learning outcomes would not meet expectation due to the fact that they have less chance for asking and communicating. In addition, the modest number of schools in a certain area is a factor that could give influences on home-school distance, which is likely the most burden preventing children from entering schools. \n In spite of these arguments, I believe that being equipped with computers and stable Internet connection should be considered as demanding action to solve this issue. Children can take any material or course present in traditional format via Internet, so that they were given the resources to take charge of their own learning while teachers play a role as facilitators. This student-oriented, active learning approach might help to alleviate the burden on teachers, as well as students can keep their own pace and level. As a result, children in remote areas not only have instant access to well-prepared educational program via online platform, but also can update latest knowledge as their peers in better-staffed urban schools. \n In conclusion, although infrastructure and human resources might be the target to improve for better education in disadvantaged areas, I personally prefer the innovative in which students have computers to gain knowledge from the Internet no matter what the circumstances.","Minh, your opening paragraph is short by one sentence because you failed to indicate the instruction for the discussion in your paraphrase.

However, several areas could be enhanced for clarity, organization, and adherence to the essay prompt's requirements.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay begins by introducing the topic and the two viewpoints on solving the educational access issue. However, it would benefit from an additional sentence in the introduction. This sentence should outline how the essay will explore both sides of the argument before presenting a personal viewpoint. Instead of just mentioning the views and your stance, explicitly state that you will analyze both perspectives and then offer your opinion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay is largely well-written but contains a few errors and awkward phrases that could be simplified for clarity. For example, ""When a teacher have to take care more students in a class"" should be corrected to ""When a teacher has to care for more students in a class."" Attention to verb agreement and simplifying complex phrases will improve readability and effectiveness.

3. **Author's Point of View:** The essay's viewpoint is clear – favoring technology (computers and internet access) as the solution over building more schools and hiring more teachers. This stance is well-stated, but the transition to the personal opinion could be smoother by first discussing both views equally before presenting the personal preference.

4. **Arguments Support:** The essay provides reasons for both viewpoints, yet it predominantly focuses on the benefits of providing computers and internet access, overshadowing the discussion on more schools and teachers. For better balance, dedicate equal attention to discussing why some people prefer the traditional approach of more schools and teachers. Include specific examples or evidence to strengthen each argument.

5. **Conclusion:** The essay's conclusion should succinctly summarize the discussion, reiterating the key points made for both perspectives and the author's own stance. Avoid introducing new arguments in the conclusion. Instead, focus on closing the essay definitively by restating why your chosen solution is preferable, based on the analysis presented.

**Overall,** the essay represents a good effort to tackle a complex issue.

However, the argument about the negative impact of online gaming on children's eyesight also needs similar backing with details to strengthen the point being made.

On the topic of spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are noticeable errors throughout the essay. For instance, issues with article usage ('game' should be 'games' or 'an online game'), and the word 'is' in the opening sentence should be 'is considered'. These grammatical errors can make the essay difficult to understand in parts, so focusing on sentence structure and grammar rules will be beneficial. Using tools or resources to check grammar could be helpful in improving these aspects. 

The essay's point of view is clear, with a balanced look at both the benefits and disadvantages of online gaming for children. This is a positive aspect as it shows the ability to consider multiple perspectives. 

In terms of arguments, while the essay presents clear points, they can be made more impactful with the addition of more descriptive language and examples. Expanding on how games specifically increase creativity, beyond just referencing a study, could provide a more compelling argument. Similarly, for the negative impacts, details about how long periods in front of the screen can harm vision could enhance the reader's understanding.

The conclusion appropriately summarizes the essay's main points but could be stronger by suggesting a more detailed recommendation for parental guidance over children's gaming activities. It's important to ensure the conclusion fully addresses all aspects brought up in the essay. 

Overall, this is a solid attempt with clear potential. Concentrating on grammar and expanding on arguments with more descriptive details would greatly improve the essay. Keep practicing, and with time, writing skills will undoubtedly enhance.",3,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4641,https://essayforum.com/writing/equal-amount-money-medical-research-86495/,dev,Ielts2 - The equal amount of money to both medical research and the protection of environment,"It is said that government funding for the care of habitants' health should give preference to medical research over the protection of environment. From my opinion, I disagree with this view and would argue that people's health would be completely protected if government allocates the equal amount of money to both medical research and the protection of environment. \n To begin with, there are a number of reasons why government should spend money on medical research. Firstly, these days, there is an increase in human illnesses are caused by the infection with new virus species that people do not have not a clue about them, of which consequences could be unpredictable and unprecedented. For example, the covid-19 pandemic caused by novel coronavirus took a heavy toll on not only millions of people's health all over the world but also the global economy. Therefore, investing public money in medical research for the discovery of timely vaccines and cures for this new coronavirus disease is urgent in order for the situation not to worsen infinitely. Secondly, many dangerous diseases such as cancers, or strokes cause high death toll but there still fails to have optimal methods or effective drugs for the treatment of these illnesses. As a result, it is necessary to conduct more medical research on these diseases to improve human well-being and increase life expectancy of people. \n On the other hand, maintaining environmental sustainability should also be set the same government budget as medical research. It is evident that the environmental pollution is considered as the major culprit which poses a serious threat to people's health since a vast number of diseases of people results from living in polluted surroundings. For example, air or water pollution could lead to long-term health problems such as cancers, cardiovascular, or respiratory illness. Consequently, financing public money to the protection of environment such as developing waste treatment technology or conducting environmental awareness campaigns contributes to reducing the negative impacts of environmental pollution on people's health. \n In conclusion, I think that both medical research and the protection of environment play an equally important role in protecting citizens' health, and government should spend the equal budget on both of them.","You have 40 minutes to write a perfect version of this essay. While you may be able to write 363 words during that period of time, the one thing that you failed to do, was perfect the content. You took the quality and clarity of your writing for granted in favor of writing more words. The extra long essay did not help your presentation. \n You are writing using word fillers. Word filler sentences and phrases do not really help move your essay forward, but would definitely add to your word count. The extra large word count doesn't matter when the paragraphs are not clear and do not make sense immediately to the reader. Be concise. Clarity scores well, wordy essays never score well due to the forced errors that students end up making. \n Word filler samples: \n <em>To begin with, there are a number of reasons why government should spend money on medical research. Firstly, these days...</em> \n - Unnecessary introduction. All Task 2 essays must start with a clear topic sentence. The examiner does not care for the word fillers. If the vocabulary does not relate to the actual discussion, the extra words do not matter. It just means that you are not familiar enough with the topic to be able to write about it using relevant discussion sentences. \n Your second paragraph is a discussion deviation. Remember, you were asked a direct question, to which you disagreed with the discussion. This is not a comparative discussion essay. You are writing a direct, single opinion essay. The two discussion paragraphs should only offer information that proves your dis/agreement with the given statement. There is no middle ground. You cannot use a ""maybe"" for a response. Specially when you clearly stated a disagreement with the point of view presented. The main problem that will give this essay a failing score is the way that you created your own discussion topic, showing that you did not understand the discussion instructions for the topic provided. The argument you present runs counter to the discussion instruction you were given. This essay will not get a passing TA score because of it. Now, add the grammar and clarity issues of your paragraph to the scoring consideration and you will find that this type of writing will not get a passing score. \n Never change the discussion requirements. You are scored on your ability to discuss the essay in the required format. That is why you cannot use a ""maybe"" or ""50/50"" response in the discussion. You must always represent a clear position, based on the prompt choices, and support only that position throughout the discussion.","This essay offers a thoughtful position on an important topic. However, there are several areas where improvements could lead to a clearer, more compelling argument. Firstly, it's crucial to ensure that the essay directly responds to the given topic. The prompt requires a stance on allocating government funding between medical research and environmental protection, to which a clear and direct position must be articulated throughout the essay. Veering towards a comparative or middle-ground discussion, particularly when a definitive stance has been asked for, detracts from the essay's effectiveness. It's important to stay focused on directly supporting your chosen standpoint without introducing a comparative analysis that wasn't requested.

Secondly, clarity and conciseness are key. The essay sometimes relies on filler words and sentences that don't necessarily advance the argument, making it longer without being more effective. For example, phrases like ""To begin with, there are a number of reasons why government should spend money on medical research. Firstly, these days..."" could be more directly stated to keep the argument focused and powerful. Aim to eliminate unnecessary words and focus on constructing clear, direct sentences that contribute directly to the argument you are making.

Regarding grammar and style, there are a few errors that could be corrected for improved clarity and professionalism. For instance, “For my opinion, I disagree...” could be more correctly phrased as “In my opinion, I disagree...” Also, pay attention to subject-verb agreement and the correct use of articles. 

Your point of view does become clear as the essay progresses, which is good. However, ensuring this viewpoint is clearly stated at the beginning and consistently supported throughout would enhance your argument's impact. Each paragraph should directly contribute evidence or reasoning that supports your stance, avoiding deviations or comparisons that could dilute your main point.

The strengths of the essay include a broad understanding of the importance of both medical research and environmental protection. You provide specific examples, such as the reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, which help to ground your argument in reality. 

To improve, focus on directly answering the prompt with a clear stance, eliminating filler words for greater conciseness and clarity, and correcting minor grammatical errors. By doing so, you will create a more impactful and cohesive essay that clearly communicates your viewpoint and persuasively argues your position.

4642,https://essayforum.com/writing/food-advertising-banned-same-smoking-94154/,dev,Food advertising should be banned the same as smoking is since overeating is harmful as smoking.,"Some researchers contend that the habit of eating too much will pose a threat to peoples' health and thus, suggest that food commercials should be banned the same way as cigarettes are. This essay will disagree with the latter view, and justifications are as follows. \n To commence with, advertisements on food should not be prohibited entirely since not all food is detrimental to peoples' health. In fact, fruits and grain-based products are considered healthy food, so it seems rather unresonable to not permit their advertisements to be broadcast on mass media. On the contrary, there is no variation in terms of healthy and unhealthy in cigarette brands, and it should be blocked from citizens' view as a way to lessen the likelihood of having health problems amongst them. \n Another factor that can not be overlooked is the economy. On the one hand, it is conspicuous that the food industry has an enormous impact on a nation's economic growth. Therefore, if the sales went down due to the prohibition policy, the country would have to suffer a huge loss. On the other hand, cigarette manufacturing does not contribute to the economy that much as the food industry does, so if there is a decline in sales, the loss will be less severe. \n In conclusion, based on aforemention explainations, I suggest that it is not a good idea to ban food advertisements the same way as cigarettes one are.","It would have been nice if you could have used alternate terms for ""researchers"" since it is still close enough to the original term used (research). By using alternate words such as analysts or food scientists, you would have shown a wider and related vocabulary to the examiner, thus boosting your LR score at the very start. The prompt restatement is a bit short on the interpretation side as it does not indicate that over eating and smoking are similarly seen in terms of cause and effect. Without that link, the mention of banning certain food advertisement does not have a basis. It creates a questionable reference in the eyes of the reader. The essay cannot have an opinion because it is a mere product of the act of writing. The main questions was pointed to the writer. Do YOU agree or disagree? Therefore, a personal pronoun reference should be used in response to the given inquiry. The prompt restatement + writer's opinion is badly developed and will not receive a good preliminary score. \n The reasoning paragraphs are not developed along the key discussion line which is ""addiction"". Overeating was no longer the focus of the discussion in relation to food addiction and the need to ban certain food types, such as junk food, in advertising. Yes, the health benefits should be considered, but you have obviously misunderstood the actual discussion chain which is: \n <em>Junk food ---&gt; Habit forming ---&gt; Overeating ---&gt; Food addiction ---&gt; Health problems<br/>Cigarettes ---&gt; Habit forming ---&gt; Chain Smoking ---&gt; Smoking addiction ---&gt; Health problems<br/><br/>Solution: Ban advertising to dissuade people from falling into these 2 bad health habits<br/>Consider: Yes or no? Why? Use health reasons that relate to both junk food and cigarettes</em> \n The focus is on health, the economy does not figure in any way towards the discussion targets. A commonality that would create connected discussion considerations for a cohesive presentation is not found in the 2 paragraphs. The way the discussion considerations were not correctly addressed in this essay shows that the writer did not properly outline his thought process and possible discussion topics, as the above example shows. This is why he failed to consider the correct discussion format and discussion targets for his reasoning paragraphs. The discussion is therefore, incorrect. \n The concluding summary does not offer a proper summative discussion within the 2 sentence word format. It does not allow for a proper recapitulation of the preceding discussion. Therefore, full scoring consideration for this portion cannot be provided either.","Your essay provides a perspective on the debate regarding the appropriateness of banning food advertisements as a means to protect public health, contrasting it with the ban on cigarette ads. While you've made a clear attempt to state your disagreement with such a ban, there are several areas in your essay that can be significantly improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and argument strength. Here’s how:

1. **Topic Response and Restatement**: Your introduction does touch upon the topic but lacks a direct linkage between the effects of overeating and smoking, missing a critical comparison that the essay prompt likely intended to explore. When restating the essay prompt, aim to clearly show your understanding of the topic. You could better frame the debate by explicitly linking overeating and food advertisements to health concerns, similar to how cigarette smoking and its marketing are viewed.

2. **Vocabulary and Expression**: There's an opportunity to diversify your language right from the start. Instead of repeating terms like ""researchers,"" consider using synonyms such as ""analysts"" or ""nutrition experts"" to broaden your lexical range and demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the topic. This enhancement would not only enrich your expression but also signal a higher language proficiency to the reader.

3. **Clarity of Author’s Viewpoint**: It's essential to use personal pronouns to specify that the opinions presented are yours. Phrases like “I suggest” or “I believe” help personalize your argument, making it clear that these are your viewpoints, which is critical in response-driven essays.

4. **Argument Development**: Your arguments primarily focus on the economic impact and the broad categorization of food into healthy and unhealthy. However, the central theme of the discussion proposed in the essay topic - the cycle of addiction and its health implications for both food and cigarettes - was missed. When making your case, it's crucial to tackle the topic's core by examining the specific reasons for or against advertising bans in the context of addiction and health outcomes. Using the model of ""addiction"" as a framework could better guide your argumentation, addressing both the health and societal implications more coherently.

5. **Economic Considerations**: While mentioning economic impacts provides an additional dimension to your argument, it diverges from the primary health-centric discussion. If you choose to discuss economic aspects, it should be more tightly linked to the health implications of food and cigarette consumption and advertising, ensuring it supports rather than distracts from your main argument.

6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion needs to more effectively encapsulate the key points made throughout the essay. Try to offer a succinct summary that reaffirms your stance while reflecting on the discussions made. This is your final opportunity to underscore your position and the rationale behind it, so ensure it captures the essence of your argument comprehensively.

Improving these areas will make your essay more responsive to the topic, enhance its logical flow, and significantly boost its persuasive power.

4643,https://essayforum.com/writing/social-networking-sites-enormously-detrimental-90315/,dev,Social networking sites have enormously detrimental effects on people and the whole community,"It is widely argued that social networking sites have enormously detrimental effects not only on each person but also on the whole community. To a certain extent, I agree with this statement. However, I also believe that social media has certain positive impacts on both individuals and society. \n On the one hand, I would agree that the use of social networking sites makes people become passive and more likely to lose their communication skills in society. In other words, individuals who always keep themselves in rooms for many hours and spend most of their time surfing the webs, chatting with their friends or maybe strangers, etc. This leads to the fact that such people gradually become more silent and isolate themselves from their families. In addition, most children who have phones on their own often stay home instead of going outside to play outdoor activities, such as soccer, swimming, jogging, and so on. These children can easily become passive and if this takes long, they can get depression. \n On the other hand, I also think that mass media is means of communication which helps people contact each other more easily regardless of distance. It means that social networking sites create advantageous conditions for individuals to keep in touch with each other without concerning where they are. For example, when you have far relatives who are very difficult to meet, through social media, you can have a talk with them, see their faces and know what are they doing. This thing is very beneficial for human beings, especially overseas students who can not get together with their parents because of studying. \n In conclusion, while social media have intensively harmful to each individual and association. I believe that using social networking sites has positive effects either. If they know how to use it efficiently and reasonably, it will bring them a lot of great benefits.","This essay asks ""to what extent do you agree or disagree?""

As the TA score is partially based on the clarity of the writer's opinion, this essay will receive a failing score automatically due to the writer stating support for both, when there is clearly a single opinion requirement. \n There is true uncertainty presented on the side of the writer that will guarantee this essay will fail. The discussion format is incorrect as it does not use the single opinion format as required. This was never implied as being a comparative opinion presentation. Not a single paragraph can receive even a partial scoring based on the proper (prompt relevant) opinion of the writer because he failed to provide one at the start and throughout the essay. The essay failed because the writer misunderstood the discussion instructions.","The essay provided offers a balanced view on the impact of social networking sites on individuals and society, presenting both positive and negative aspects. However, it's important to refine and focus the essay to fully meet the requirements of the prompt and enhance its overall effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to address the topic but falls short by presenting a divided stance instead of a clear, singular opinion. For this type of essay prompt, which asks to what extent you agree or disagree, it's crucial to choose a clear position and support that position throughout the essay. To improve, decide whether the positive or negative impacts of social media are more persuasive and structure your essay around that viewpoint.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay is relatively well-written but could benefit from closer attention to grammar and style. Some sentences are overly long and could be simplified for clarity. Additionally, watch out for the correct use of plural and singular forms (e.g., ""social media"" instead of ""social networking sites"" for consistency, ""has"" instead of ""have"" when referring to ""social media"" as a singular noun). Consider breaking down complex ideas into shorter sentences. This will make your essay easier to understand, especially for readers who are also English learners.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** The main area that requires improvement is the clarity of your point of view. The essay currently straddles both sides of the argument without committing to a clear viewpoint, which is not aligned with the essay's instructions. To enhance your essay, state your opinion clearly in the introduction, and reaffirm this stance in your conclusion. This will not only meet the prompt's requirements but also provide your essay with a strong, persuasive edge.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay introduces arguments for both the positive and negative effects of social media. However, to align with the need for a singular viewpoint, select the side that you believe stronger and expand those arguments with more examples, facts, or personal observations. Each paragraph should support your main point of view, contributing to a cohesive and convincing argument.

In summary, focusing on presenting a singular, clear opinion on the impact of social networking sites and supporting this opinion with concise, well-structured arguments will significantly improve the essay.

From my personal perspective, I strongly believe that belong to sites has numerous advantages over few drawbacks. Both the aspects are demystified in ensuring paragraphs. To commence with, there is no disputing the fact that people have a tendency to have their eyes glued to the screen. With a vast array of teenagers engaging in social media, especially dating apps, would become easier for them to expand their circle of friends. Intelligent functions in certain websites do favors for updating user's profiles to find a suitable soulmate with regard to the interests such as preferences, culinary art, and pets. Tinder, the pervasive application among teenagers where 90% of its users have found their perfect match, by means of illustration. Moreover, people will have various options to figure out the compatible partner for prenuptial agreements, which is by far more convenient than the conventional way of dating. By contrast, there are a number of bad repercussions due to the existence of such applications. It is universally acknowledged that users are not able to feel real emotions during taking part in dating sites. Therefore, it is restrictive for individuals to share their feelings and genuine personalities. In addition, there is a boatload of tactics that cyber-criminals can delude users into some escalating perils. Public information can simply be stolen on account of not having reliable security infrastructures, which is a precursor to some dire consequences. To recapitulate, whether to engage in a dating site or not is an individual decision. It is true that dating app has played an integral role in gathering people closer, however, there are some drawbacks such as cheating and fraud. In my point of view, such applications have a strong influence over the current generation and have so many pros than cons.","The writer must learn to use the appropriate paragraph format for the task 2 essay presentations.

It attempts to explore both the advantages and drawbacks of this phenomenon. However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. 

Firstly, it is critical to adhere to a structured format for essay writing. The essay should be organized into separate paragraphs, each serving a specific purpose - starting with an introduction that restates the topic and presents the opinion clearly. This should be followed by paragraphs that discuss reasons supporting the opinion, and the essay should conclude with a summary that encapsulates the main points and the writer's stance. This structure helps in creating a more organized and easily understandable essay.

Secondly, the essay's argument appears to waver between supporting and critiquing the use of dating sites, which makes the author's standpoint somewhat unclear. It is essential to maintain a consistent point of view throughout the essay. If the task requires expressing an opinion on whether the subject ""does more harm than good,"" it is important to choose a definitive stance and support it throughout the essay with clear and concise reasons. This focus will help in providing a stronger argument and avoiding confusion.

Regarding language use, there are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need addressing. For instance, the phrase ""belong to sites has numerous advantages over few drawbacks"" could be rephrased for clarity, perhaps as ""using dating sites has several advantages despite some drawbacks."" Additionally, when citing percentages or facts, such as ""90% of its users have found their perfect match,"" ensure these are backed by credible sources or presented as illustrative examples rather than definitive statistics unless they are verifiable.

The essay's arguments would benefit from more precise examples and explanations. Instead of broad statements about the pros and cons of dating sites, providing specific, real-world scenarios or citing studies could strengthen the arguments. Also, the conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points made in the essay, reinforcing the author's opinion.

Lastly, it's important to address possible security concerns and emotional drawbacks of dating sites not just as a list of issues but by exploring their implications on users and society. This deepens the analysis and showcases critical thinking.

In summary, focusing on a clear and consistent stance, adhering to a structured essay format, addressing language and stylistic issues, and enhancing arguments with specific examples and explanations will significantly improve the essay's quality and effectiveness.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

There are opinions that environmental problems should be responded by global organizations while others believe that these issues had better be carried out by nations. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and try to reach a conclusion. \n There are several reasons why environmental problems should be elucidated internationally. First, global environmental organizations which have a number of countries attending will be able to have certain impacts on them. For example, the global environmental facility (GEF), which has 183 countries, brings out certain levels of limited industrial exhausted air to their participants. At the same time, these organizations also have the abilities to punish countries which have harmful actions to the environment or celebrate those which have efforts in protecting the environment. \n However, the issue of environmental problems should also be tackled by the government of each country. Each country knows its environment condition best so its government will have appropriate actions for environmental reservation. For example, due to the hazardous of air pollution in Hanoi, the Vietnamese government has drafted an environmental plan that is to reduce 20% of NO2 and SO2 from 2020 to 2025. \n In conclusion, it can be argued that solving environmental problems nationally be easy to make progress, my own opinion is that environmental issues being handled globally is crucial and effective to conserve the environment.

You were not being asked to come to a conclusion regarding the given discussion. Aside from that slight misdeclaration, you did a good job on presenting the prompt paraphrase. It is close enough to the original. \n The biggest problem of this practice essay though is that you have included actual research in the paragraph presentations as part of your reasoning. Since this pencil or ink based test does not give you access to a computer at the testing center, you should not make it a habit to use researched information in your reasoning. Use your personal opinion or information gained from public knowledge instead. \n That is not to say that you made a mistake in reasoning. It just means that your reasoning is good but in the actual setting, you will not have the opportunity to do research in response to a question. So it would be best not to practice taking the test in a manner that you won't be able to accomplish in the testing center. \n By the way, your personal opinion should be the 3rd paragraph presentation in a comparison essay. It cannot be part of the concluding statement because the personal opinion needs to be built up in the same manner as the comparison discussions. This is your chance to indicate if you support a particular idea and why. The conclusion should just summarize the discussion and close the essay. \n This is a good start but your reasoning and presentation needs some work. You are on the right track though so keep it up.

While your introduction sets the stage for this discussion, it's essential to clarify that the task is to compare these views and then express your own opinion, rather than to conclude the discussion broadly.

One of the essay's strengths is presenting both sides of the argument, showing an understanding of the global and national perspectives on addressing environmental issues. However, it would be beneficial to focus more on expressing your personal opinion as a separate and detailed part of the essay, rather than only including it in the conclusion. In a comparison essay, your viewpoint should be clearly stated in its own section where you can elaborate on why you support a particular side, using examples from common knowledge rather than specific research not accessible during a test. 

Regarding your arguments, remember that the testing environment may not allow access to external sources for research. Therefore, relying on general knowledge and personal opinions will be more practical. While your essay includes specific examples, such as the global environmental facility (GEF) and the actions of the Vietnamese government, it’s essential to develop your reasoning based on what is commonly known or personal perspective to ensure you're prepared for the exam setting.

Stylistically, your essay is generally well-structured, but paying closer attention to verb tenses and grammatical agreement could enhance clarity and readability. For instance, using terms like 'elucidated internationally' might be clarified with simpler language, such as 'solved by the international community.' Additionally, phrases such as 'environmental problems should be responded by' could be rephrased for correctness and clarity to 'environmental problems should be addressed by.'

In conclusion, your essay makes relevant points about the importance of both global and national efforts in tackling environmental issues. Improving on structuring your arguments, particularly in expressing and developing your personal opinion separately, and relying on general knowledge or personal insights rather than specific research, would make your argumentation stronger. Also, refining the language for clarity and grammatical correctness will enhance the overall effectiveness of your essay.

Profits and drawbacks of gaming","Essay: \n In recent times, the playing video games considered to bring harmless joy and a utile education tool. Meanwhile, many people assert that video games bring negative effects on players. This presents both pros and cons, however, in my opinion, its drawbacks are much more significant than the benefits. \n Firstly, one reason why playing games is advantageous is that can help to reduce stress after the rest of hardworking or study time. For example, the players can enjoy the stories, music throughout the game, or even chat with their friends. This not only help gamers forgets the work pressure but also improve player's mood, promote relaxation and ward off anxiety. Furthermore, one further justification which should not be ignored here is that this activity could be used in education as a useful training method. This means that these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking, and problem solving, all of which are useful skills in real life. \n However, I would argue that these drawbacks are outweighed by the benefits. It is important to remember that gamers are extremely competitive. In other words, the users usually want themselves to constantly get higher score, new targets, and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to win their friends or reach the best of high score table. As a result of getting lost for hours in a game, the gamers start to get not enough sleep, lack exercise, or lack time for real life relationships. \n In conclusion, although video games exerts some adverse aspects, the disadvantages can justify these. In my point of view, playing games gain the potential dangers more than the possible benefits. \n ---","While ""utile"" is a middle school level word, it is not an everyday English word that can be used to define ""useful"". I realize that the student has chosen to use an uncommon word in the hopes of impressing the examiner, and gaining a higher LR score. However, the opposite will happen when the word is used out of context, like in this case. The examiner is not looking for impressive sounding advanced English words. He is looking for everyday conversational words that easily fit in normal conversations or writing. Keep it simple. The higher LR score will come from the proper use of words, not simply from the advanced level of words used. \n The writer has offered an opinion statement that leans towards one side of the essay. As such, he is expected to fully explain his reason for supporting this idea within 2 paragraphs. As he is not asked to discuss both views and give an opinion, the actual discussion should only be with regards to his actual opinion. This is not represented as a comparative essay in the original presentation. \n That said, the only paragraph that will receive a score is the one related to the actual opinion. Then the essay will develop scoring problems as the presentation will not fall under the minimum word count. It will be deemed under developed and will be scored based on an incomplete defense or explanation of the given opinion.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the pros and cons of playing video games, asserting that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Here is feedback aimed at making this piece of writing more effective and coherent:

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay addresses the topic by presenting both sides of the argument regarding video games but ultimately concludes the disadvantages dominate. However, the structure could be improved by focusing more on the author's stance rather than equally discussing both views. Since the position leans towards the negative impacts of video games, expanding on this point with more depth would make the argument stronger and more aligned with the thesis statement.

2. **Language Use**: It's noticed that an attempt to use higher-level vocabulary, such as ""utile,"" was made. While it's beneficial to use varied vocabulary, it's crucial to employ words correctly and in their common context. The word ""utile"" is less common and might confuse readers or appear out of place. Opting for “useful” could enhance clarity without sacrificing sophistication. The aim is to communicate effectively and naturally, using language that fits the context.

3. **Clarity and Style**: While advancing the argument, some sentences come across as convoluted, making them hard to follow. This can be improved by simplifying sentence structures and ensuring that each sentence directly contributes to the point being made. Avoiding repetition and ensuring that each paragraph introduces a new idea or piece of evidence will also make the essay more engaging.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay mentions several positives and negatives of video gaming but does not delve deeply into them. To strengthen the essay, focus on a few key points and elaborate on them with specific examples, research findings, or personal observations. This depth of analysis will provide a more persuasive and informative read.

5. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are minor grammatical errors and instances of awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For example, in the opening sentence, ""the playing video games considered to bring harmless joy"" could be revised to ""playing video games is considered to bring harmless joy."" Ensuring subject-verb agreement and revising for clarity will greatly improve the readability of the essay.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion restates the thesis effectively but could be enhanced by summarizing the key points made in the essay. This recap will remind readers of the evidence and analysis provided, reinforcing the argument.

In summary, focusing on these areas will make the essay more coherent, compelling, and aligned with English proficiency standards. It's important to remember that clarity and simplicity often lead to a stronger and more persuasive argument than complex vocabulary and sentences.",3,3,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Kindly provide a copy of the complete prompt requirement so that you can be better assessed in terms of the scoring band for this task. It is a bit difficult to decide on your task accuracy and grammar range scores due to the lack of prompt requirements. While the essay seems to be properly discussed, there are some grammatical issues and task accuracy questions that I have with regards to your writing. These questions that I have can only be clarified by the prompt requirements. I want to be fair in scoring you so I will withhold giving you final scores for the 4 sections until you can provide me with the accurate prompt. I will wait for it. Thanks.","Your essay explores the movement of people from rural areas to cities and discusses both the reasons behind this migration and the potential for rural development. However, to provide more specific and helpful feedback, it's important to clarify if the initial paragraph serves as an introduction to the topic or if it directly addresses a given prompt. Knowing the exact requirements of the task would greatly assist in assessing the essay's alignment with the topic and in giving precise advice on both grammar and content.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Without the original prompt, it's not entirely clear whether the essay fully meets the task's requirements. Make sure your essay directly addresses all parts of the prompt. If the goal is to examine reasons for urban migration as well as the potential for rural development, ensure both aspects are balanced and thoroughly explored.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay contains several grammatical errors and could benefit from clearer sentence structures. For example, ""people from rural area"" should be ""people from rural areas"" to match plural context. Additionally, ""there"" should be replaced with ""their"" when indicating possession, as in ""for their home town."" Try to vary your sentence lengths and structures to improve readability and ensure your points are conveyed clearly.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your stance on urbanization and rural development is mentioned, but it could be articulated more clearly. It's beneficial to directly state your thesis in the introduction and reiterate it in the conclusion for emphasis.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While you provide examples and reasons for urban migration and the desire for rural development, these arguments can be made stronger with more detailed explanations and specific evidence. For instance, when discussing the lack of infrastructure in rural areas, offering concrete data or studies would bolster your argument. Additionally, exploring the societal and economic impact of these migrations on both urban and rural areas could provide a more comprehensive view.

To enhance your essay, consider revisiting and refining your thesis statement to more directly reflect your main arguments. Ensure that each paragraph presents a clear idea, supported by examples or evidence, and contributes to your overall position. Lastly, paying close attention to grammatical details will not only improve the readability of your essay but also the professionalism of your writing.

4648,https://essayforum.com/writing/differences-human-workers-robot-81497/,dev,Differences between human workers and robot workers,"With the continuous progress of science and technology, automated robots are being used to replace manpower in more posts. Irreplaceable advantages as robots do have, the question of whether robots can completely replace humans remains open to be debated. To begin with, robots are preciser and more logical than staff in present. Although they almost entirely depend on the employers' commands to execute, robots can only use the inherent program to run the tasks, unlike human staff who can adjust the order to avoid problems in advanced. In other words, robots cannot modify themselves when the codes goes wrong, but human workers can easily solve this question. Secondly, robots workers can remain efficient at any time, without slacking off and emotions. Human workers are different, but this shortcoming for people sometimes happens to be an advantage. A few perfect coincidences due to several minor emotional mistakes. For instance, penicillin was discovered by an accident. The final difference between human and robot is cost difference. Company ought to pay a range of costs for the staff, such as salary, transportation subsidies and insurance and housing fund. Robot workers only need to be supplied power and patched by mechanical parts, which can help the company save a large of money. Consequently, the discrepancy between human workers and robot workers are remarkably different.","Dear student, when indicating ownership of something such as employer's commands, an apostrophe S is used to indicate that a person or persons own the action or thing. The apostrophe after the S is used only when a contraction. You made these mistakes in your essay presentation. Remember the rules about the use of an apostrophe S and apply it next time. When you indicate an example in an essay, such as the story of the discovery of penicillin, tell the whole story. Since this refers to an accidental discovery, explain how it happened.Finally, the reference to the coding situation. Humans can easily adjust to the situation, they can resolve the situation, they do not solve the question because coding refers to a program that instructs a process, it is not a question. \n What I can see in this essay is that you have a very good grasp of the English language and its vocabulary. Now, there are still imperfections in your sentence structures and word presentation but these do not hinder the understanding of what you are trying to impart to your reader. As an ESL, a native English speaker can make allowances for these simple mistakes but you should try to avoid repeating the same errors in the future if you want to improve your writing skills in English.","The essay tackles the topic effectively, discussing whether robots can completely replace humans, focusing on their precision, emotional capacity, and cost difference. This examination is relevant and aligns with the prompt, presenting clear arguments.

However, there are several areas for improvement:

1. **Use of Apostrophes for Possession**: There seems to be confusion with the use of apostrophes to indicate possession (e.g., the employer's commands). An apostrophe followed by 's' is used to show that something belongs to someone. Pay attention to this rule to avoid future mistakes.

2. **Detailing Examples**: When referencing examples like the discovery of penicillin, it is crucial to provide enough detail to make your argument clear and engaging. Simply mentioning an event without explaining how it supports your argument leaves the reader wanting more information.

3. **Clear Language in Arguments**: The essay suggests that humans can 'solve a question' when coding errors occur. It's more accurate to say that humans can 'resolve issues' or 'correct errors' in coding because coding involves instructions for processes, not answering questions. This precision in language will make your arguments stronger.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Some minor errors and awkward phrasing can distract from your message. For example, ""robots are preciser and more logical than staff in present"" could be rephrased to ""currently, robots are more precise and logical than human staff."" Always proofread to catch these errors.

5. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Your stance is discernible but could be made clearer by directly stating your position at the beginning and summarizing it at the end. This reinforcement helps the reader understand and remember your argument.

6. **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary**: While your command of English and vocabulary is commendable, focusing on simplifying complex ideas and avoiding repetitive sentence structures will enhance readability and impact. 

In summary, focusing on clearer expression of ideas, careful use of grammatical structures like the apostrophe, and detailed explanation of examples will significantly improve your essays. Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep writing, and use these suggestions to guide your revisions.

Some people assume that instead of finding measures to solve this problem we should find some ways to live with it. I totally disagree with this idea. \n On the one hand, human life quality would become worse if we accept to live with climate changing. It is without controversy that natural resources are irreplaceable parts of our life notwithstanding how modern people are. For a clear example, natural energy resources such as oil, coal, sun still contribute the largest energy percentage of the whole world. Moreover, people's life expectancy almost sticks to the quality of the surrounding environment. Climate change can cause many disasters such as floods, storms, volcanoes, these fierce phenomenons can damage facilities immeasurably and even make people die. \n On the other hand, live with climate change is just a reason that people give out to hide their lack of responsibilities to the environment. To prevent climate-changing people have to obey various rules and they decline their profits. For example, to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in polluted air, factories would have to update their systems that require a huge financial resource. Therefore, companies usually ignore this method. Besides, people do not have the exact knowledge as well as behaviors to prevent the fast-changing climate. They usually blame for the busy life and their convenience that ignore the environment. For example, the way that people use private transportation is increasing dramatically this totally cause the air quality to become worse at an alarming rate. \n In conclusion, find a way to live with climate-changing is totally not a holistic measure for our life. I entirely think that humans should improve the alarming situation instead.","Why do you totally disagree? What are the reasoning topics you will be discussing?

That will be enough to help create a stronger prompt restatement + Response outline for your next paragraphs. \n As an extent / degree essay, you must use justifications for your opinion in the 2 reasoning paragraphs. Convince the reader that your opinion is the correct one by disproving 2 publicly known norms or information that you feel can be counter argued. This essay is strongest when done using counter arguments. That means, present what people believe to be correct about the topic, then present information that disproves the said opinion. Hence the ""degree"" or ""extent"" of your disagreement. You could say something like ""While it is accepted that.... is beneficial to the environment, I oppose this idea because the end result of that practice is..."" Just to give you an idea of how to create a counter argument. Yes, this is one essay where the written debate format can be used.","The essay presents a clear stance against the idea of simply learning to live with climate change, arguing for proactive measures to address the issue instead. This is a pertinent perspective, especially in the context of the global conversation on environmental preservation. However, there are areas for improvement to strengthen the argumentation and clarity of the essay, align with best practices for writing a compelling and coherent piece.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay effectively addresses the topic by arguing against the notion of adapting to climate change without attempting to mitigate it. To enhance clarity and persuasiveness, it's beneficial to briefly outline the main reasons for this disagreement at the beginning. For example, stating, ""I totally disagree with this idea for two main reasons. Firstly... Secondly..."" This approach helps to preview your argument's structure to the reader, making your points more digestible and your argument more compelling.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor grammatical and stylistic issues that affect the readability of the essay. For instance, maintaining verb tense consistency and paying attention to article use (e.g., ""climate change"" instead of ""climate changes"" and ""live with climate change"" instead of ""live with climate changing"") would improve clarity. Simplifying complex sentences and ensuring subject-verb agreement would also benefit the essay's comprehensibility. It's essential to proofread the essay to catch these errors.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The point of view is clear and maintained throughout the essay, which is a strength. However, enhancing this clarity through a more structured outline of arguments at the beginning, as previously mentioned, would further solidify your stance to the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay attempts to support the author's position with examples and reasoning. To make these arguments more effective and persuasive, consider employing a counter-argument structure. This involves presenting a commonly held belief or argument (for example, that adapting to climate change is enough) and then systematically disproving it with evidence or reasoning (e.g., outlining the long-term detrimental effects on human health and the economy). This method strengthens your position by directly addressing and dismantling opposing viewpoints.

In conclusion, focusing on these aspects will significantly improve the essay's effectiveness. Addressing each point with specific, actionable suggestions allows for a more structured, clear, and persuasive argument against merely adapting to climate change. Strengthening the structure, along with careful attention to grammar and style, will enhance the overall quality and impact of the essay.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

However, as a writing practice essay, it should be well within the word requirements of the class. Again, not knowing what I am reviewing for is proving to be a problem when it comes to advising you. The essay simple and easy enough to understand though.","This essay addresses important concerns about the impact of social media on children and teenagers, highlighting both the benefits and risks associated with their participation in network environments. The topic is well-chosen and the essay aligns with a general essay prompt about the effects of technology on youth. However, there are several key areas where improvements could be made to strengthen the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay does address the prompt by discussing the effects of social media on children and teenagers, it could be improved by providing more specific examples to support the arguments. Instead of generally stating the risks, detailing actual scenarios or studies could enhance the effectiveness of the points being made.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow of the essay. For example, ""children taking part in social media have various usefulness"" could be improved to ""children participating in social media experience various benefits."" Additionally, ""face with many risks"" should be corrected to ""face many risks."" Ensuring sentences are clear and grammatically correct is crucial. 

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay's point of view is somewhat clear; it leans towards cautioning against the dangers of social media for young users. However, this stance could be strengthened by explicitly stating the essay's position in the introduction and reiterating it in the conclusion for emphasis and clarity.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The arguments presented are relevant but lack depth and specificity. To make a stronger case, it would be beneficial to include detailed examples, statistical data, or references to research studies. This evidence could better illustrate the points made and provide a more compelling argument.

**Additional Considerations**:

- **Word Count**: Although the word count requirement is unknown for this specific task, for standardized tests like the IELTS or TOEFL, essays typically need to be at least 250 words. If this essay is intended for such a test, expanding on the arguments, providing more examples, and elaborating on the impacts of social media could help meet this requirement while also enriching the essay's content.

- **Essay Structure**: The essay would benefit from a more structured approach, including a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on one main idea, and a conclusion that summarizes the essay’s key points and reiterates the stance taken.

- **Complexity and Language Use**: For English language learners, it's important to challenge oneself to use a range of vocabulary and sentence structures. While the language in the essay is understandable, varying sentence construction and employing a wider array of vocabulary could both improve the writing quality and demonstrate language proficiency.

In conclusion, focusing on these areas for improvement can substantially enhance the essay. By providing more specific examples, correcting grammatical errors, clarifying the point of view, and structuring the essay more effectively, the argument against the excessive use of social media by children and teenagers will be much more compelling and clear.",3,3,3,4,2,2,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, I believe that the advantages of this trend are more significant despite its obvious shortcomings. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that relocating for a job comes with some disadvantages for workers. Obviously, they are likely to suffer from mental issues due to geographical barriers. Physical distance usually discourages individuals from confiding their troubles to their loved ones. Consequently, those people tend to keep suffering to themselves, which can lead to psychological diseases such as depression. Additionally, time consumption is another notable drawback to a certain extent. Since it is challenging for some to adapt to a new environment, people have to devote some time to make new friends and get used to the working spaces subsequently. \n On the other hand, moving away from their beloved people for a job can benefit employees in various ways, which I believe far outweighs its shortcomings. First and foremost, pursuing employment beyond their place of origin may offer increased prospects for superior career opportunities. Cities and metropolises are hubs of various industries, which results in advancing their career path and a promising future. As a result, it is much easier for individuals to find a suitable job. This, moreover, can help people instil a sense of independence as they need to tackle problems without parental support. Should people live far away from their family members, they are forced to put aside some money and avoid unnecessary expenses to pay bills on time. \n Conclusively, it seems to me that the merits of job relocation are more notable than the disadvantages. Thus, employees should be encouraged to work in big cities in terms of independence and better career choices.","Only the second reasoning paragraph will be given scoring considerations for this writing task. That is because only that portion supports the opinion you presented in the restatement + writer's opinion paragraph.

It is a single opinion essay reliant on your ability to prove that your point has valid supporting opinions. You did not that effectively in this essay because you used the incorrect response format. When you use the incorrect response format, you will end up losing major scoring considerations based on task accuracy and related response formatting.","The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, presenting both the disadvantages and advantages of relocating for work. However, to meet the requirements of the assignment more effectively, focus should be placed on solely supporting the chosen perspective rather than comparing both sides. This approach will help in developing a more targeted and impactful argument.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the topic by discussing the effects of moving for work. However, it resembles a comparative essay by discussing both advantages and disadvantages. Since the assignment aims to support a single point of view, it would be more effective to concentrate on arguments that solely bolster the chosen stance. This means expanding on why the advantages outweigh the disadvantages without actually detailing the disadvantages.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: Overall, the essay is well-written with few spelling or grammatical errors. However, ensuring that the writing style is consistent with the task requirements is essential. Remember to maintain focus on supporting your main argument throughout. Refining the transition between ideas can also strengthen the essay's coherence and readability.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The point of view is clear - the essay supports the idea that the benefits of relocating for work outweigh the disadvantages. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, more directly state this perspective from the beginning and continue reinforcing it throughout the essay. Avoid detouring into discussing disadvantages unless it's for the purpose of refuting them with stronger advantages.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: The essay correctly identifies substantial benefits such as improved career opportunities and development of independence. To enhance this section, incorporate more specific examples, statistics, or personal anecdotes if possible. This will make the argument more compelling and grounded. Remember, the focus should be on elaborating these benefits rather than contrasting them with the disadvantages.

However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and the overall impact of the essay.

1. **Topic Response**: The essay attempts to address water pollution but lacks focus. It seems to oscillate between general water pollution and its specific impact on Quynh Phuong beach. Choosing one aspect to concentrate on—either the broader issue of water pollution or its localized impact on the beach—would make the argument stronger and more coherent. Clearly stating the main topic in the introduction with a thesis statement would guide the essay more effectively.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay contains several spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""human"" should be ""humans,"" ""go"" should be ""goes,"" ""Moroever"" should be ""Moreover""). Additionally, punctuation and usage of conjunctions need improvement for better readability. For instance, semicolons (;) are used where commas (,) or conjunctions could connect ideas more smoothly. Simplifying sentences and carefully proofreading would greatly benefit the essay's readability and professionalism.

3. **Clarity of Author's Viewpoint**: While the essay hints at an urgent call to action against water pollution, the author's viewpoint could be articulated more robustly. Making a clear and strong statement early on about the author's position on the issue would help. For example, explicitly stating how crucial it is to address water pollution for environmental and community health sets a decisive tone for the essay.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides scenarios and consequences of water pollution (e.g., death of sea species, impact on tourism). These could be more persuasive with specific data, studies, or examples illustrating the extent of the problem and the effectiveness of proposed solutions. Adding these elements would strengthen the argument.

5. **Improvement Suggestions**:
   - **Focus and Structure**: Outline the essay before writing, clearly defining the main focus and supporting arguments. Ensure each paragraph logically leads to the next, maintaining focus on the chosen topic.
   - **Introduction and Thesis**: Begin with a clear introduction that includes a thesis statement summarizing the essay's main argument or stance.
   - **Cohesion and Coherence**: Link ideas within and across paragraphs more coherently. Use connectors and transition words to smoothly guide the reader from one point to the next, keeping the discussion unified.
   - **Evidence and Examples**: Whenever possible, include facts, statistics, or real-life examples to back up statements. This evidence can make arguments more convincing.
   - **Conclusion**: Conclude by summarizing key points and restating the importance of addressing the issue, potentially highlighting a call to action.

By focusing on these aspects, the essay can become a more powerful and engaging piece, clearly conveying the urgency of addressing water pollution and encouraging active participation in solutions.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Because of this, there are some arguments that the citizens' health is badly affected by the cities' lifestyle. I agree with this opinion. However, I strongly believe that living in big cities still has certain benefits for people's health and some perspectives of people's lives. \n Admittedly, the environment of big cities can have terrible influences on the citizen's health. Many types of vehicles are used to adapt to the needs of the movement of the citizens. It leads to air pollution since their exhaust can cause some serious diseases of the human lungs, respiratory, and heart. Besides that, the crowded population and the lack of space for outdoor activities are the reasons that make people feel cramped and overwhelmed. Some even have problems with mental health. Additionally, because of the hustle and bustle of the city, people are under pressure to make money and have less time to care for and ensure their healthy eating. For instance, they usually eat junk and unhealthy foods to save time and money which causes poisoning and obesity. \n However, living in big towns can provide people with certain ways to protect their health. The first one is people who live in cities can easily approach to modern hospital with advanced health equipments whenever they have health problems. The reality is that villagers always come to these big cities in their country to ask for disease treatments instead of in their hometown because it is more effective. Moreover, with the widespread technological development, people can be informed quickly about the health policies of governments. There are many health programs held in the big cities to help people enhance their knowledge about preventing and protecting their health. \n In summary, living in big cities has both drawbacks and benefits. Firstly, air pollution and limited space can lead to serious diseases in people's physical and mental.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay addresses the topic but needs a clearer, more consistent viewpoint. Instead of presenting both sides equally, firmly state your position in the introduction and use the body paragraphs to support that viewpoint. For instance, if you believe the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, make that clear from the start and focus your arguments to support this perspective.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are some minor grammatical errors and areas where the wording could be simplified or made clearer. For example, “approach to modern hospital with advanced health equipments” could be simplified to “access modern hospitals with advanced equipment.” Pay attention to singular and plural forms, as well as article usage (a, an, the). Additionally, try to vary your sentence structures to make your essay more engaging.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** The point of view needs to be clear and consistent throughout the essay. Decide whether you agree or disagree with the statement and ensure all your arguments align with this stance. Avoid sitting on the fence as this can make your essay seem unfocused.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While you do provide arguments for both the negative and positive aspects of city living, enhance your essay by offering more detailed examples and evidence that directly support your main opinion. For every point you make, ask yourself if it clearly backs up your stance on the issue. Also, considering focusing more on quality than quantity; a few well-explained points are often more effective than many superficial ones.

5. **Conclusion:** Summarize your main points and restate your opinion in the conclusion to reinforce your stance. This is your chance to leave a strong impression on the reader, so make sure it's clear and concise.

Remember, the strength of an essay often lies in clearly stating your opinion and supporting it with well-structured arguments. Focus on clarity, consistency, and providing specific examples to improve your writing.",3,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative
4654,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-think-increase-antisocial-behavior-89301/,dev,"""Many people think there is an increase of antisocial behavior and a lack of respect to others.""","In recent years, it has been increasingly common to see people behave impolitely and disrespectfully to each other. This trend is caused by several reasons regarding problems in one's life and education environment. This essay will help to find feasible solutions in order to mitigate these situations. \n The cause of various matters of a lack of politeness is bitterness and frustration from human's life, especially in working. Workers sometimes have work disputes with others about essential projects. It happens when there is too much pressure for people if they work overtime and get prolonged stress from their co - workers and boss. As a result, they could be able to release anger on their family by lashing them out. Another issue is that people might not be well - educated when they were young. In other words, if parents educate their kids well, they can get a certain decency of behaviour and attitude. \n There are several actions that could be taken to solve the problems. First, a calm conversation is one of the best viable ways to stay away from conflicts. It means that people could set for themselves some discussion standards or develop a rudeness filter to avoid attacking others by words uncontrollably. A second measure would be learning how to keep calm and be kind to another. In particular, there are many soft skill classes for people to control their feelings and prevent inconsiderate behaviours toward others. Last but not least, family is the first socialization environment for children so education plays a vital role in this situation. \n In conclusion, prolonged stress and lack of education are the main reason for rude behaviour. Nevertheless, there are possible measures that can be taken to deal with the problems regarding having a calm talk, learning how to express emotion and being well - educated from a family environment. \n (304 words)","In the prompt restatement, you are offering a factual statement rather than a representation of your understanding of the original discussion topic. What is provided for your interpretation is a questionable opinion from a public perspective. The repetition should follow those lines without changing the ""questionable"" aspect of the topic presentation. You could have better restated this as: \n <em>A portion of the population speculate that there is a growing trend towards unsociable conduct and impoliteness towards one another. I believe that this is caused by 2 reasons namely; ... The matter can be remedied through...</em> \n In the causes paragraph ( paragraph 2 ), you are over discussing the topic. This caused you to use 2 fully developed and related reasons and one under developed and little explored topic. Since the essay will be scored on Cohesiveness and Coherence, you should stick only 2 related discussion topics in a single paragraph. That is not impossible to do. You already did it for the first 2 reasons which are working overtime and stress. \n Kindly notice how I restated the original topic without changing the original information. I merely changed the keywords and interpreted the topic based on my understanding of the original topic. Then I used 2 sentences to create my thesis presentation covering the causes and solutions/improvements with regards to the topic.","This essay discusses the issue of people behaving impolitely and disrespectfully, attributing this tendency to stress and lack of education, and suggests solutions for it. Here are some areas for improvement and strengths identified:

1. **Understanding and Responding to the Topic**: Your introduction attempts to restate the issue at hand but slightly misses the mark. It's important to reflect the original topic with a nuanced perspective. Instead of stating it as a general fact, consider framing it as an observed trend or opinion, for instance: ""Many believe there is a growing tendency towards unsociable behavior..."" This approach encourages readers to engage more critically with the content.

2. **Content Development and Organization**: In your second paragraph, where you outline the causes of impoliteness, you've included several ideas. While it's good to offer detailed explanations, focusing on too many points can dilute the cohesiveness of your argument. Try to limit your discussion to two closely related ideas and develop those fully instead of adding more with less development. This will enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your argument.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: You have made a commendable effort to structure your essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. However, ensure each paragraph sticks to one main idea for cohesiveness. When presenting causes and solutions, it's useful to introduce them in a logical order and link them clearly to your thesis to maintain coherence throughout the essay.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling and grammatical issues throughout the essay, such as unnecessary hyphens in ""well-educated"" and ""co-workers"". Such errors, though small, can distract readers. Aim for simplicity and clarity in your writing. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to enhance the stylistic flow of your essay. 

5. **Point of View and Arguments**: Your point of view is clear, and you provided arguments supporting your viewpoint. To strengthen your essay, ensure that your arguments are well-supported with examples or further explanation. This practice will make your position more convincing.

6. **Solutions and Conclusion**: Your suggested solutions and conclusion reaffirm your thesis effectively. To improve, directly tie each proposed solution back to the causes you've identified, demonstrating a full-circle understanding of the issue and its remedies.

In summary, your essay addresses the topic with a clear viewpoint and structured arguments. By focusing on a nuanced introduction, limiting and developing key points, enhancing grammatical accuracy, and linking solutions directly to identified problems, you can significantly improve your essay's impact and coherence.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4655,https://essayforum.com/writing/importance-history-science-technology-91893/,dev,Writing IELTS Task 2: The importance of History vs Science and Technology in school,"In an accelerating pace of modernization nowadays, it is universally acknowledged that a constantly changing and competitive society is looking at the all-around education of candidates and not merely their academic credentials. However, there is a perception that History fulfills the most vital function of the syllabus, while others contend that this role should be attached to Science and Technology. From my perspective, both History, Science, and Technology are inextricably linked with each other due to several plausible reasons. \n There is no doubt that History has been offering tremendous assistance to learners regarding not only theoretical but also practical horizons. By getting exposed to the vary of wars and occurrences, undergraduates are directly engaged in the past that broadens their optimistic outlooks on today's life and arouses students' moral behaviors because of the pride and gratitude towards forefathers. For example, it is able for students to be conscious of present tranquility results from the suffering of ancestors, hence taking more responsibility for the motherland's development by achieving outstanding academic records. \n Nonetheless, as for the skeptics to this opinion, subjects like Science and Technology are more superior than History in being as the most essential factors in terms of rendering assistance to students' contemporary skills. It is gaining access to advanced facilities by attending these classes that provide students with many hard skills for the newly-created job opportunities. Taking computer, analytical, and presentation skills for instance, which recruiters expect in their employees, candidates are capable to develop these abilities unconsciously over the course. \n However, I am utterly convinced that both History, Science and Technology are not mutually excluded. While History focuses on instilling the solid academic foundation for further self-perfection into the psyche of candidates, technology-related subjects such as Science and Technology precisely show learners the way in controlling cutting-edge equipment, thus contributing to their future occupational competency. \n To recapitulate briefly, as for the aforementioned personal viewpoints, both History and subjects like Science and Technology play equally crucial roles in well-rounded education's contribution. It is high time for schools to aim at ensuring students' intellectual and social development which exerts influence on individuals' future career success.","A task 2 essay should be completed with no more than 300 words, within 30 minutes. The remaining 10 minutes should be used to perfect the presentation and correct the errors. The writer should not add any unrelated statements in the first paragraph.

Whatever you think, or whatever it is you want to say about the topic, should wait and be presented in the reasoning paragraphs. \n <quotation>There is no doubt</quotation> \n Do not use misleading terms. There is a doubt about this opinion, that is why you are writing this written debate paper.

You can imply it in the same manner that ""skeptics"" indicated the other group's opinion in the next paragraph. That was an effective method of differentiating opinions. \n Your personal opinion paragraph should be properly developed. Do not use run-on sentences and rush through your idea. You need to make that part of the essay the clearest portion, so use individual explanation sentences. Make sure your idea is clearly explained and well supported by examples and additional discussion points.","This essay successfully addresses the topic, presenting a clear stance that both History and Science and Technology play vital roles in education. However, there are several areas where this essay can be improved to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test essay, particularly one like task 2, which has specific requirements regarding structure, clarity, and word count.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay responds to the topic but could benefit from a clearer and simpler introduction. The opening paragraph should succinctly state your opinion without introducing unnecessary information. Stick to a simple structure: restate the question and then provide your opinion. This helps the reader understand your stance from the beginning.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Overall, your essay is well-written, but there are instances of complex and long sentences that could be simplified for clarity. Aim for shorter sentences that are easier to follow, especially when presenting your main arguments. Additionally, watch out for the usage of terms like ""There is no doubt,"" as this can be misleading. Opinions on educational topics are often diverse, and acknowledging this can strengthen your argument.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your personal viewpoint is evident but could be made clearer, especially in the paragraph where you discuss your own opinion. Using pronouns effectively can help distinguish between your personal views and general statements or the opinions of others. For instance, using first-person pronouns for your own opinions and third-party pronouns for others can help clarify whose perspective is being presented.

4. **Argument Clarity and Support:** Your arguments are compelling but need to be more clearly developed. Avoid run-on sentences and take the time to fully explain your position. Each idea should be expanded upon with examples or further discussion. This not only makes your essay more persuasive but also easier for the reader to follow.

Additionally, considering the constraints of a task 2 essay, aim to write your essay within the word limit and allocate time at the end to review your essay for any errors or unclear points. This review time is crucial for polishing your essay and correcting mistakes.

By focusing on a clearer introduction, simplifying language, distinctly expressing your point of view, and elaborating on your arguments with examples, your essay will become more effective and engaging.

However, to enhance the essay and better meet the objectives of English proficiency tests, there are several areas that require improvement.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay responds to the given topic but could be more directly focused on the specific question or statement provided. Ensure that the essay directly addresses the topic at the beginning and maintains this focus throughout.

2. **Language and Style**:
   - **Simplicity and Clarity**: The attempt to use advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures has made the essay difficult to understand. It's important to remember that clarity and simplicity are key. Instead of using complex vocabulary or phrases, focus on clear and straightforward language. This makes your essay more accessible to the reader and can actually improve your score.
   - **Specific Word Choice**: Some of the words and phrases used do not convey the intended meaning accurately. For example, phrases like ""parallel with significant aggregate of goods using"" and ""consigning harmful effects on habitat"" are confusing. Aim for precision in language, choosing words that exactly match what you're trying to say.
   - **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are several grammatical errors and unconventional use of punctuation (e.g., misuse of commas, ellipsis). Reviewing basic grammar rules and punctuation usage can significantly improve the essay's readability.

3. **Point of View and Arguments**:
   - The essay's point of view on environmental issues is clear but would benefit from more structured arguments. Presenting your views in a more organized manner, with distinct paragraphs for each main idea, will make your arguments stronger and more persuasive.
   - Including specific examples and evidence when arguing about the detrimental effects of human behavior on the environment or when suggesting solutions could make the position more compelling. This adds credibility to your statements and allows the reader to better understand and sympathize with your viewpoint.

4. **Coherence and Cohesion**:
   - The essay jumps from one point to another without smooth transitions, which can confuse the reader. Using linking words to connect ideas and paragraphs will help with the flow of the essay.
   - Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that indicates the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on that idea.

In summary, focusing on refining language use by favoring clarity and simplicity, structuring the essay with clear, connected ideas, and supporting arguments with specific evidence will significantly improve the essay.

While i accept that the prevalence of these modern devices may negatively affect people's communication skills, i believe that with proper use, this can benefit people in terms of personal communication. \n On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why computers and mobile phones have to take responsibility for the downfall of face-to-face communication. One reason is that the excessive use of these devices discourages real interaction. Young people nowadays tend to spend a large proportion of their time on computer screens or their cell phones rather than with their family members and friends. For example, mealtimes when all the family used to get together are becoming a thing of the past. Furthermore, the misuse of personal electronic devices may bring about less time spent practising and developing communication skills that are essential when people want to express themselves cogently and with clarity. For instance, my close friend who is addicted to playing games on his cell phone had considerable difficulty in articulating his point of view when required to give a speech in front of the class. \n On the other hand, computers and mobile phones can bring benefits to people who want to communicate face to face more effectively in many ways. First, there are numerous tutorial videos on the Internet with regard to communication skills. Therefore, people can easily access such videos via mobile devices and gain valuable insights into how to have a good conversation. For example, by putting what he had learned from videos about job interviews on YouTube, my brother successfully landed his dream job at GSK, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the prevalence of mobile devices can give young people countless opportunities to develop their language skills. As a result, they will become more confident and find it much easier to have a conversation with native speakers when studying abroad. \n For the reasons mentioned above, it is true that the usage of computers and mobile phones can have a negative impact on people's ability to communicate face to face, but i believe that these modern tools can help to develop communication skills, if they are used wisely and properly.","Dear student, this being an extent essay, you must respond to the question being asked in the manner expected. This is not a simple opinion essay. This is a measured opinion essay. Therefore, to respond by simply saying that you believe in something related to the discussion topic is incorrect.

The thesis statement / prompt response for this essay, based upon what I read in your final paragraph, it appears that you agree with the given statement. However, you are not in total agreement with the statement either. This is where the problem with your essay comes in. \n You are actually delivering a confused statement here. You cannot be both in agreement and disagreement with the given statement. You need to pick one side for the discussion and stick to it or, make it clear from the very beginning that you do not fully agree by stating that; ""I partially agree with the given statement due to a number of reasons."" Without that extent statement of partial agreement, your total essay fails to make sense as it does not properly respond to the task requirements. \n Consider defending only one side of the discussion as part of your extent statement in order to avoid confusion next time. If you think about which side you truly support more, you can indicate that you strongly, totally, or unequivocally support a particular discussion side. This makes it easier for you to write the essay because you avoid the need to do a comparison discussion which, in your case, created the confusing point of view and lack of proper extent statement at the start of the discussion. \n Don't get me wrong, you show that you understood the prompt topic but not the discussion instruction. Your discussion paragraphs also show that you are capable \n of properly thinking of supporting explanations and appropriate examples for your statements.

However, the presentation of your argument could be significantly improved by clearly aligning with the requirements of an extent essay, which requires a measured opinion.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay touches on the given topic but lacks a clear stance required for a measured opinion essay. Instead of indicating a straightforward agreement or disagreement, explicitly state your degree of agreement or disagreement from the beginning. For instance, you could say, ""I partially agree with the statement due to several reasons."" This will guide the reader through your argument more effectively.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written, but it’s important to maintain consistency in the use of pronouns. The first person 'I' should always be capitalized to maintain formality and correctness. Additionally, there are instances where more formal language could enhance the essay's tone, emphasizing its academic nature.

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:** Your essay presents a dual stance that causes some confusion. For this type of essay, you need to choose a side more clearly. If you aim to present a nuanced view, it should be clearly stated at the outset with a phrase like ""I partially agree,"" which would help clarify your position and make your argument more coherent.

4. **Arguments and Supports:** The positive aspect of the essay is your ability to provide relevant examples to support your points, showing a good understanding of the topic. Moving forward, ensure that your arguments directly support your stated stance to keep your essay focused and persuasive. Tie each argument more closely to your thesis to enhance coherence and strengthen your overall argumentation.

This essay serve to give an insight into the reasons behind this negative situation, its effects and several solutions to deal with it. \n Probably the main factor is the eating habit of children. To be precise, they usually eat junk food such as hamburgers and chip as well as drink sugary soft drinks. Those kinds of products contain large amount of sugar and fat subtances which lead to obesity. The other major cause is that children don't take part in enough physical activities.

Firstly, obesity can lead to overweight, unhealthy and unfit. Moreover, children have a higher risk of diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases and cancer. As the result, they will be a burden on hospitals in the future. \n As we see the consequences of obesity, some actions should be taken to protect children's health. Firstly, parents and schools should give children healthy food, control what they eat in order to ensure they have a healthy diet. Furthermore, computer using time of children need to be limited and replaced by sports and exercise.

Though you tried to completely address the topic, all you did was ensure that you will get a failing score instead. Always review the original prompt and make sure you never stray from the original discussion in your discussion paragraphs. Right now, your essay is long, but mostly irrelevant in terms of discussion.","The essay focuses on a highly relevant and critical topic: obesity in children, which is an important issue to discuss. There is a clear attempt to tackle the subject by outlining the causes, effects, and solutions related to childhood obesity. However, for improvement and to ensure the essay fully addresses the topic, it's crucial to concentrate on what the question directly asks. The essay should primarily focus on solutions to combat the problem of childhood obesity, as this is the core aspect of the topic question. While providing a backdrop about causes and consequences enriches the discussion, dedicating more space to tangible, actionable solutions would make the essay more aligned with the prompt's requirements.

There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, ""Recent evident indicates"" should be corrected to ""Recent evidence indicates,"" and ""This essay serve to give"" should be ""This essay serves to give."" Also, there's a consistent mistake with the pluralization of words (e.g., ""chip"" should be ""chips,"" ""fat subtances"" should be ""fat substances""). Paying close attention to such details would greatly enhance the readability and professionalism of the essay.

There's a direct approach in stating the main points: unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity as primary causes, the dire effects, and a call to action for solutions involving parents, schools, and the government. However, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into each proposed solution, providing more detailed and descriptive arguments to support the claim that these measures could effectively tackle childhood obesity.

Offering examples, statistics, or citing successful case studies where similar solutions have been implemented could provide stronger support for the author's position. Encouraging the inclusion of more specific, actionable solutions, like promoting educational programs on nutrition or government incentives for healthy food options, could also strengthen the essay.

Overall, the essay addresses a significant health concern with clear intent. With focused revisions on aligning more closely with the given prompt, correcting language inaccuracies, and deepening the analysis and support for proposed solutions, the essay has the potential to be a compelling and persuasive piece on combating childhood obesity.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

(Ielts writing task 2),"The idea of taking a gap year before attending college is becoming more and more prevalent among high school graduates. There are many benefits as well as drawbacks of this phenomenon. \n Having a year off after high school graduation is advantageous in some certain facets. Firstly, students can have time to relax after a fundamental competition and be more prepared for a completely new environment in university. Some students take this as a chance to travel and get to know more about various fields such as foreign language and culture. They are also be able to acquire useful soft skills from attending temporary courses which are needed for the future but rarely taught in high school. Secondly, due to the inadequate provision of career orientation in high school, sparing another 12 months looking for a job or signing up for a vocational course is considered a remedy for students to figure out their future path. Using this one year's time reasonably can save a lot of time for gap year takers later as it equips them to be more confident, competent and oriented towards future. \n From an opposite angle, the disadvantages of a gap year are varied. Initially, compared to the students having a year off, those who go straight to college are likely to have a permanent job earlier. They finish their academic studies one year in advance, have better opportunities to get a job with stable income. Moreover, high school seniors might lose their studying habits as well as discipline. In other words, one year spent on traveling can demotivate them from tertiary education. \n In conclusion, despite having many benefits in terms of traveling and working, taking a gap year also has certain shortcomings that people should pay heed to. \n *-----------------------------------------------------*","Dear student, the good news is that you have managed to avoid making any grammar or sentence structure errors during the writing of your essay. Expect to be scored highly in terms of your essay's LR and GRA potential. So that means you have delivered an essay that meets the indicated 2 scoring considerations to a great extent. However, with that said, I cannot say that you can score highly in terms of the TA consideration because the presentation of your discussion is under developed and choppy in presentation due to the lack of proper transition sentences or phrases at the end of the paragraphs. \n You also lack the minimum 3 sentence requirement for the opening paraphrase and concluding summary at the end. Your opening paraphrase lacks a proper paraphrase which could have been presented as: \n <em>High school graduates have shown a trend of skipping their first year of college after high school graduation. Known as a gap year, there are some concerns regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this practice. This essay will discuss the generally known facts regarding the advantage and disadvantage of this growing practice.</em> \n Then the concluding statement should have summarized these important points from the reasoning paragraphs over 5 sentences to provide a clear reminder of what the discussion topic was, what the reasons for the discussions are, what the talking points were for each paragraph, then a closing sentence that merely sums up the preceding presentation to close the essay . \n Even worse, the second paragraph is more than the maximum 5 sentence requirement due to the second discussion topic you presented at the end of the paragraph, which resulted in an underdeveloped discussion presentation for that topic. That will have a direct effect on the C&C scoring potential of your essay. \n Since you have a maximum 5 paragraph allotment for each Task 2 essay, you could have used a transition sentence at the end of the first topic for discussion to help introduce the second topic. The second topic should have been fully developed in discussion content in the next paragraph over a total of 3-5 sentences, a practice that, when you get used to doing, immediately increases your scoring potential due to your ability to clearly explain your opinions or develop public discussions. \n In truth the errors you made are what I consider to be unintentional errors since you are not familiar with the proper formatting of the Task 2 essays yet. You should learn how to better present your paragraph discussions as you develop your writing style. Try to read the other task 2 essays online and take note of the advice given to those writers, learning what their mistakes were and how to avoid those same errors on your part should help you polish your writing skills in no time.","The essay effectively addresses the topic of taking a gap year before starting college, weighing both its advantages and disadvantages. The clear structure and avoidance of grammatical or sentence structure errors show a strong command of language, which is a positive aspect.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the clarity and development of the essay. Transition sentences or phrases at the end of paragraphs are lacking, leading to a presentation that feels disjointed. Integrating these can help to create a smoother flow between paragraphs and improve the overall cohesion of the piece.

The introduction and conclusion could be strengthened. The introduction should more precisely frame the discussion by offering a clearer paraphrase of the topic, something akin to highlighting the trend among high school graduates to take a gap year and its potential benefits and drawbacks. The conclusion should extend beyond a simple reiteration of points made; it should aim to succinctly summarize the key arguments discussed and tie them back to the overall topic, ensuring it spans at least three sentences to meet minimum requirements and improve clarity.

Moreover, adherence to guidelines regarding paragraph length should be considered. The second paragraph's extension beyond a five-sentence limit due to the introduction of a second discussion topic at its end resulted in an underdeveloped presentation of that topic. This could impact the essay's coherence and cohesion score. Future essays might benefit from a more balanced distribution of topics across paragraphs, utilizing a transition sentence to deftly introduce new topics while keeping discussions focused and adequately developed within the three-to-five-sentence guideline.

Encouragement is offered to familiarize with the proper formatting of Task 2 essays.

4660,https://essayforum.com/writing/traffic-congestion-issue-causes-95333/,dev,IELTS WRITING TASK 2 - TRAFFIC CONGESTION ISSUE - CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS,"In your opinion, what are the causes and solutions to them? \n Due to a dramatic rise in population, traffic jam has been a globally debatable issue. This essay will discuss rooted causes and give possible solutions to address the problem. \n There are countless reasons leading to traffic congestion. First and foremost, residents prefer personal vehicles to public transport. Life in the city is often noisy and glamorous anh people migrating from the countryside are overwhelmed with the hectic pace and charm in urban areas. As a result, the population is rising uncontrollably, causing congested roads a high level of saturation in rush hours. High buildings and skyscrapers are being set up but there is not enough space for a large number of inhabitants. Additionally, roads and lanes are occupied by street vendors and for entertaining activities (for example: playing football on sidewalks). Streets are also venues for weddings, special events and so on. Therefore, roads are getting narrower and traffic congestion is worsening. \n To solve this dilemma, the government should impose new policies on limiting vehicles moving on the roads. Individuals should better prioritize public transport instead of owning cars only for gratification because it is essential to lessen the number of transportation to alleviate traffic jam. Companies also can allow employees to work from home or change office hours so that working time of parents will not coincide with schooling time of children. \n In conclusion, traffic jam is still one of the primary problems in our contemporary world. I strongly believe that those satisfactory answers can partly deal with the aforementioned causes.","<quotation>Due to a dramatic rise in population,</quotation> \n This is a personal opinion on your part. Therefore, you cannot use this as a part of the prompt restatement. The prompt restatement demands that you only rephrase the original information provided. You could move this personal opinion to your writer's opinion section towards the end of the paragraph though. You will receive additional points towards this statement since it helps establish a clear idea of what your discussion will be about. There will be 2 deductions for this paragraph. The incorrect positioning of your personal opinion, and the lack of proper personal opinion presentation in response to the questions provided. \n <quotation>There are countless reasons leading to traffic congestion. First and foremost,</quotation> \n Do not waste the word count and writing time on filler presentations. A filler presentation is a sentence that does not help to move your thought process or explanation along. You do not need long introductions. What you actually need are topic anchor sentences at the start of every paragraph.","The essay attempts to address the topic of traffic congestion, its causes, and possible solutions. Several aspects can be improved for a stronger argument and clearer expression:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The introduction starts with mentioning a ""dramatic rise in population"" which sounds more like a personal opinion than a direct response to the given prompt. To improve, it’s crucial to stick closely to the wording of the prompt in the introduction, reserving personal opinions for later after establishing a base with the prompt’s language. Try to rephrase the original prompt more accurately while integrating personal viewpoints more seamlessly into the discussion sections or towards the end of the introduction.

2. **Language Use:** There are a few instances where the choice of words or phrases (e.g., ""anh people migrating,"" presumably intended as ""and people migrating"") might confuse readers. Additionally, sentences should be more concise to improve clarity. For example, instead of saying ""there are countless reasons leading to traffic congestion,"" it's more direct to say ""Several factors contribute to traffic congestion.""

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay contains minor spelling and grammatical errors. It’s important to proofread to correct instances of typos or missing letters. Also, varying sentence structure could help in making the essay more engaging. Be mindful of run-on sentences and aim for precision in language to enhance readability.

4. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The essay does present a point of view, focusing on the premise that traffic congestion is a problem with identifiable causes and solutions. However, articulating this viewpoint could be stronger with more specific examples and a clearer connection of those examples to the thesis. Ensuring that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that relates back to the thesis can improve clarity.

5. **Arguments and Support:** The essay lists various causes and solutions for traffic congestion but falls a bit short in fully developing these ideas. Each cause and solution mentioned could be expanded with more details or examples for stronger support. For example, discussing how exactly public transportation can alleviate traffic and the specific policies that could encourage its use would add depth to the argument.

6. **Avoiding Filler Phrases:** It's advisable to eliminate filler words or phrases that don’t contribute directly to the argument. Starting with a strong topic sentence in each paragraph without preamble can make arguments more impactful.

In conclusion, focusing on a tighter alignment with the prompt, enhancing the clarity and specificity of arguments, and refining the language for grammatical accuracy would significantly improve the essay's effectiveness. Aim for direct, specific statements that directly engage with the prompt, and ensure each paragraph contributes meaningfully to the overall argument with clear, well-supported points.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4661,https://essayforum.com/writing/factors-define-person-social-position-well-91506/,dev,"What factors define a person? His social position, as well as the level of his wealth","Nowadays, there is a common belief that social positions, as well as the levels of wealth, can define a person with less consideration on other traditionally moral virtues. From my perspective, I do not advocate this point of view as differences between abstract and material values. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that to some extend, people can gain higher respect and build up their reputation due to social status and their own property, especially in East Asia countries where the society was featured by hierarchy. People work, receive benefits and make friends based on their social classes. It's rare to witness a rich lady get along with poor children. \n On the other hand, good ancient values are still fundamental to building up a sustainable society. A person who is honest and kind can receive love from other people. Maybe he cannot live a luxurious life, but his mind is comfortable and full of happiness. Talent without virtue can be a danger to society. For example, in Vietnam, a KOL who is famous for either negative scandals or positive popularity could earn an enormous amount of money through their social media channel and advertisement. Temporarily, that man can buy friends, summon tons of privileges at will, and be considered as an idol in another's eyes. However, without a good moral personality, he may incidentally spread negative and wrong information widely which results in damaging effects and wrong actions of the viewer. As he lost his money, his false friends returned to him as impertinently. \n In summary, wealth or social status is not the key factor to define a person who is worth being a friend or admired. Talent and virtue should be combined to define a whole human being.","<quotation>I do not advocate this point of view</quotation> \n I understand this sentiment. However, the strength of this opinion is not indicated using an emotional measurement. Therefore, the response aspect of the restatement is only partially correct. There will be an accuracy score reduction because of the lack of ""extent "" response. It bothers me that you recieved a scoring penalty for an otherwise strong presentation just because of a technicality. I urge you to review your response next time, ensure that it properly and completely meets the writing requirements. \n <quotation>On the one hand, it is undeniable</quotation> \n This response would have been more acceptable if you had presented the degree of error, as you percieve the reason to have. Remember that the purpose of an extent essay is to prove a measurement of error for the public opinion. Without that discussion, the representation becomes incorrect as a comparative response when a single opinion is expected.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing the impact of social position and wealth on how individuals are perceived versus the importance of moral virtues. Both sides of the argument are presented, showcasing an understanding of the topic. However, several areas require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to the essay requirements.

1. **Response to the Topic and Clarity of Argument**: The statement, ""I do not advocate this point of view,"" introduces your position but could be strengthened by expressing the intensity of disagreement. To fully meet the essay's requirements, consider specifying the extent to which you disagree with the common belief mentioned. This will not only enhance the clarity of your stance but also ensure your argument complies with the expected response structure, thus avoiding potential penalties for incomplete responses.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Pay close attention to spelling and grammar. For example, ""to some extend"" should be ""to some extent,"" and ""East Asia countries"" should be ""East Asian countries."" Additionally, while the essay employs a formal tone suitable for the subject, be mindful of run-on sentences and the use of colloquial expressions. Breaking down complex ideas into simpler sentences can aid in maintaining clarity and engagement.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is generally clear; however, explicitly measuring how strongly you feel about the issue could further clarify where you stand. Engaging directly with the extent to which you believe moral virtues outweigh material values could make your argument more persuasive.

4. **Support for the Author's Position**: The essay presents examples to support the argument, such as societal hierarchy in East Asian countries and the influence of a key opinion leader (KOL) in Vietnam. These examples are effective but would benefit from deeper analysis and direct linkage to how they support your main argument. Exploring the implications of these examples on society and individuals can strengthen your argument.

To improve, focus on explicitly stating the degree to which you oppose or support the prompt to ensure your response fully aligns with the assignment requirements. Enhance clarity through careful proofreading for spelling and grammatical accuracy and simplify complex ideas for better comprehension. Finally, reinforce your arguments with clear, analyzed examples that direct back to your main stance.

By addressing these aspects, the essay can achieve a stronger, clearer, and more compelling presentation of the argument, aligning more closely with the expectations for English proficiency assessments.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

When some people reject learning from the past, fortunately the others still believe that history can teach them precious lessons. \n One the one hand, I understand why many opponents of the study of history assume it has nothing to gain from doing research that what happened in the past. In their mind, Historical knowledges are rarely used in society, so we should concentrate on science or technology that can bring relevant values to the present and future. Furthermore, History, in common parlance, is the record of past events based on different facts and perspectives, it is too difficult to guarantee of the accuracy of information obtained. Therefore, if there were new discoveries about history, it would cause tremendous upheavals for human culture. \n On the other side, people who overcome conventional thinking still suppose history plays an important role in the development of mankind. It helps people have thorough insights into not only their own but also other countries 's culture and evolvement. Especially The youth need to know how their ancestors defended the nation against intruders throughout many dynasties and maintain an independent and sovereign country as currently. This would develop their patriotism and desire for peace, at the same time help young generation to avoid similar mistakes in the future. \n Finally, in my opinion, History is always an essential subject should be respected because of the values that it brings. However, the teaching of History needs to close to beneficial events in order to use in reality. \n (261 words)","Dear student, your essay became a personal opinion paper because you did not accurately represent the paraphrased statement as requiring both points of view and your opinion. Once the body paragraph is read, you immediately start with the pronoun ""I"" which is indicative of a personal opinion. Therefore, you changed the slant of the discussion from 2 points of view and your opinion to solely your opinion, creating a personal opinion essay alone. That will indicate a misunderstanding of the prompt requirements and result in a failing score for your essay. The correct format for this essay is as follows: \n 1. Paraphrased statement with discussion instructions at the end. \n 2. First point of view discussion; \n 3. Comparison discussion of the second point of view with the first point of view; \n 4. Personal opinion discussion; \n 5. Concluding paragraph. \n While you did discuss the varying points of view, the fact that you used the first person pronoun changed the point of view from public to personal. The essay prompt requires a discussion of each public point of view before your personal point of view. The thorough personal opinion is also mistakenly placed in the concluding statement. That is the improper way of writing your personal opinion. You need to write that as a paragraph that is complete and not used to simply close the essay. That is an unacceptable concluding statement because you are continuing the discussion of the topic rather than ending it in a manner that sums up the discussion for the reader and allows the reader to form his own opinion based upon the summarized information.","The essay attempts to tackle the relevance of studying history and presents two contrasting points of view before revealing the author's personal stance. However, there are several areas that can be improved to better align with the essay prompt's expectations and to enhance the overall clarity and impact of the arguments presented.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay aims to discuss the importance of learning history. Though it does touch upon contrasting viewpoints, the structure deviates from the expected format. The essay should start with a restated prompt to clearly set the stage for discussion. This is followed by exploring both points of view separately, and then your personal opinion should be a distinct, standalone section, not mixed with the conclusion. The current structure blends personal opinion too early, shifting the focus to a personal narrative rather than a balanced discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors that need attention. For example, ""One the one hand"" should be ""On the one hand,"" and ""knowledges"" should be ""knowledge"" as the latter is uncountable in English. Phrases like ""close to beneficial events"" could be clearer—perhaps ""closely related to applicable events"" conveys the intended meaning more accurately. Additionally, be mindful of article usage (""the youth"" vs. ""youth"") and consistent tense.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay does reveal your point of view, but it could be more impactful if it were presented in its own distinct section as outlined in the essay instructions. Discuss both public points of view thoroughly first, without blending in personal opinions, and then offer your personal stance in a clear, separate paragraph before the conclusion.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments provided are understandable but lack depth. For each viewpoint, include more detailed reasons, examples, or evidence to strengthen your argument. For instance, when discussing the value of learning from historical mistakes, specific historical examples could make the argument more convincing. Similarly, for skeptics who see little value in studying history, delve deeper into their concerns—perhaps examining how a focus on technology and science is perceived as more directly beneficial to society's advancement. 

Finally, the conclusion should summarize the discussions without introducing new arguments, offering a clear, concise recap that reinforces the essay’s main points and reaffirms your stance in light of the discussed viewpoints.

Improving on these aspects can make the essay more coherent, persuasive, and aligned with the expectations of a balanced discussion as required by the prompt.

1. **Response to the Topic**
   - The essay addresses the topic by exploring both sides of how the internet impacts communication. However, it lacks a clear thesis statement that summarizes the author's main point or stance. Including a specific thesis statement at the end of the introduction would provide a clearer direction for the essay and meet the expectations for a structured argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**

4. **Arguments and Support**
   - The arguments presented are relevant but need to be developed more thoroughly with specific examples and detailed explanations. Instead of broad statements, focus on providing concrete details to support your points.
   - A balanced discussion of advantages and disadvantages is attempted, but the conclusion lacks a summarization of these points and a restatement of the author’s stance. A well-crafted conclusion should restate the topic, the author's position, summarize the key arguments for both sides, and present a final statement.

Instead, they should offer other types of aid to those poor countries. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that financial aid can solve poverty. \n Firstly, I believe that financial aid can contribute to the quality of human resources and these people can contribute to the country's development such as in economics or politics. Scholarship or grant is one of a financial aid form given by developed countries. For example, UK's Chevening scholarship has been granting a number of Indonesians to study in the UK and they have been prepared to make a change in Indonesia that can support to eliminate poverty. That's why I think financial aid is beneficial. \n Secondly, money is substantially important in every aspect of our lives. We need money to buy consumption for survival. And people who commonly do not have money is those who are not able to work or get a job. By giving them money, they can use the money to help them open small businesses and buy daily needs. For instance, there are a lot of Indonesians who are in line of poverty due to extreme lack of money.

However, there is room for improvement in various areas to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. Here is a detailed analysis with suggestions for improvement:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay correctly identifies the topic and takes a clear stance on the debated issue. However, the argument that financial aid in the form of scholarships, like the UK's Chevening scholarship, is beneficial, seems to stray from the core idea of the prompt. The prompt is more focused on financial aid directly aimed at poverty alleviation in countries, rather than individual scholarships. It would be beneficial to refine the argument to focus more on economic aid provided to countries rather than educational scholarships to individuals.

2. **Clarity and Conviction**: The use of ""I think"" or similar phrases can weaken the argument, especially when making a strong statement of disagreement. Expressing a 'strong belief' or presenting the stance without qualifiers could strengthen the argument and make the position clearer to the reader. For example, instead of saying ""I think that financial aid can solve poverty,"" stating ""Financial aid can solve poverty"" offers a more definitive stance.

3. **Use of Connective Words**: The essay occasionally uses ""and"" where a more causal connection could be expressed with ""because."" This would help in forming more coherent and logically connected explanations. For instance, explaining why financial aid is beneficial because it contributes to various aspects of development would make the argument stronger.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay has minor issues but maintains readability. Attention to detail in terms of punctuation (e.g., using possessive apostrophes correctly as in ""UK's Chevening Scholarship"") and correct use of articles (e.g., ""an effective way"" instead of ""one of effective ways"") could improve the essay's overall polish.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay presents arguments to support the viewpoint that financial aid is necessary for alleviating poverty, with examples like job creation and the provision of daily needs. However, these points could be further strengthened with more detailed examples and a clearer distinction between direct financial aid to countries versus individual scholarships. It would also be beneficial to address potential counterarguments to present a more balanced view.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion reaffirms the essay’s stance but could be strengthened by summarizing the key points more distinctly to reinforce the argument made throughout the essay.

In summary, by focusing on the specific type of financial aid discussed in the prompt, presenting arguments with stronger conviction and clearer logical connections, and refining grammar and style, the essay can be significantly improved. These adjustments would make the argument more persuasive and coherent, better serving the essay's aim of advocating for financial aid as a solution to poverty.

Unlike in the past, when men were breadwinners, who decided all the things in their house, by contrast, women were mostly housewives and they had to do chores and obey their husbands. In today's society, housework is divided equally so that males and females can spend time creating their own career paths. In the family structure, recently, couples are not only boys and girls but also two girls or two boys. Moreover, many modern families choose not to have children. \n These changes have a load of effects on various parts of our society. In so doing, with the support of gender equality, women's pressure has been declining significantly. They turn out to be the well-rounded version of themselves, an independent person, as they can do whatever they want, earn their own money, etc. New family structures help young people enjoy their whole lives with their partners. They don't have to suffer from prejudice anymore. Furthermore, not having kids families makes young people reduce their pressure as they can spend time traveling, working, and so on. Nonetheless, this craze for not giving birth causes a population decrease as well as a lack of employees in the future, which is one of the problems that most developed countries try to tackle. \n By and large, these changes can bring both a wealth of positive and negative influences on many aspects of life.","While the essay meets the word count and the discussion does relate to family matters as indicated in the original prompt, the problem of the essay lies in the presentation itself. This is only a draft copy that was submitted for evaluation / grading at this point. You should never submit the paper as soon as you complete writing it. You have to review what you wrote for coherence and cohesiveness. This is where the paper actually fell apart in the scoring stage. Your presentation is too scatter brained. The discussion is choppy and lacking in actual cohesive substance between topic presentations. It is not good to write under developed ideas. Your presentation will not receive a good C+C score, which is a major scoring section that could actually help you to pass or make you fail the test. In this case, you failed.","The essay addresses the topic of changing family structures and responsibilities well, acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks of these changes. It's clear that effort has been made to present a balanced view, discussing various facets of modern family life, including changes in parental roles, acceptance of different couple compositions, and the decision not to have children. This is commendable as it demonstrates an understanding that the essay topic is multifaceted.

However, there are several areas in need of improvement to enhance the essay's overall effectiveness and coherence. Firstly, there are occasional spelling and grammar issues that need attention. For example, ""In the past years decades,"" seems to be a mix-up and should be corrected to either ""In the past years"" or ""In the past decades."" Paying close attention to spelling and grammar will help in making the essay more polished and readable.

Secondly, while the essay does explore the subject from a clear point of view, the arguments presented would benefit from deeper development and clearer connections between them. At times, the essay jumps from one point to another without fully exploring or connecting these ideas, which can make the discussion seem fragmented. Working on transitions and linking statements or paragraphs will create a more fluid and cohesive argument.

Additionally, while the essay touches on several important changes within modern families, these points could be strengthened by describing specific examples or providing more detailed explanations of how these changes affect society. For instance, when discussing the benefits of gender equality within the family, mentioning specific positive outcomes for women, men, and society as a whole could provide a clearer and more compelling argument.

In relation to the essay's structure, it would be beneficial to break down the discussion into more defined sections, with each section delving into a particular aspect of family change. This structure will not only improve the readability of the essay but also ensure that each point is adequately developed and supported.

In conclusion, the essay successfully addresses the topic by highlighting significant changes in family structures and their impacts. To improve, focus on correcting grammatical errors, enhancing the connections and transitions between points, developing arguments more thoroughly, and organizing the essay into clearer sections.

However, there are several key areas where the essay could be improved to better meet the requirements of the prompt and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

Firstly, it's important to directly address the essay prompt at the beginning of the essay. The prompt asks for a discussion on the relevance of traditional vs. popular music today, and whether traditional music should be preserved over popular music. Your essay needs a clear thesis statement that reflects an understanding of this prompt and directly answers it. You should pick a clear stance on the topic. This helps to focus your essay and make your argument more persuasive.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are minor mistakes that could be revised for a smoother read. For example, watch for the consistency in verb tenses and the correct use of articles (""a part of people’s lives"" instead of ""a part of people lives""). Additionally, consider varying sentence structure to create a more engaging and dynamic narrative flow. Phrases like ""Music plays an important role in our life"" could be more vivid and engaging.

Your essay's point of view on the importance of music is clear, and you provide several arguments to support this viewpoint. However, the arguments need to be more directly tied to the specific question of traditional versus popular music. While you mention both, there's a need to more deeply explore their individual values or why one might be preferred over the other based on your stance.

To strengthen the essay, provide clear and descriptive arguments directly related to the preservation of traditional music or the embrace of popular music. Incorporate examples, statistics, or historical information to support your arguments. For instance, if arguing for the preservation of traditional music, you could discuss its role in maintaining cultural identity or historical knowledge.

Lastly, remember to clearly express a single, definitive viewpoint regarding the choice between traditional and popular music. Ambivalence or attempting to agree with both sides does not directly answer the prompt's question and can dilute the effectiveness of your argument.

By revising your essay to incorporate a clear thesis statement at the beginning, directly addressing the prompt's question, correcting minor grammatical issues, and providing focused, well-supported arguments, you can significantly improve your essay and more effectively communicate your perspective on the value of music in society.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Informative
4667,https://essayforum.com/writing/activity-cycling-admittedly-longer-popular-91799/,dev,The activity of cycling is admittedly no longer popular. How to change this trend?,"These days, owing to the existence of high-tech means of transportation, cycling is getting fader in users' minds. Despite its being considered more environmentally friendly than other forms of transport, It currently does not gain popularity. Several reasons are answering why cycling witnessed a downward trend, also, from which some feasible solutions should be taken into account. \n In terms of sources causing cycling's low popularity, the first main cause that should be mentioned is residents' requirement for faster travelling. Indeed, by virtue of the time demanding of the workplace as well as the long-distance between destinations, people in most fields of jobs ask for more convenient and effortless vehicles such as motorbikes, cars, underground trains, etc. Additionally, some individuals find cycling too obsolete and rustic to cycle. In fact, in the present modern technology era, human beings have a tendency of being appealed in front of stylish and fancy creatures, and the vehicle is not an exception. For instance, a wide range of users opt to purchase a costly and fashionable car rather than a common and affordable bicycle. \n Based on a handful of mentioned reasons, some solutions could be brought out to tackle the current situation of cycling. Firstly, increasing the price of fuel and vehicle tax might be one of the most realistic decisions during this circumstance. Therefore, users might be wavering about whether they own a bicycle as more affordable spending. For example, because of being unable to afford the tax bill, some consumers might not know what to choose but possess a bicycle. Furthermore, the government should encourage leaders of local regions to build a notice board for bicycles for users' security. Therefore, the complaint about cycling's extent of safety might be minimized. \n In conclusion, although cycling has numerous positive impacts on human physical health as well as the environment, the activity of cycling is admittedly no longer popular in a few areas. Answering this result is due to its time consuming and not meeting the taste of users. Soon, politicians can build separate paths for cyclists and manufacture more free-fuel vehicles to respond to the needs of the community.","Good discussion with a few grammar and cohesive discussion problems for you to take note of. The errors stem mostly from your being an ESL writer. Better familiarity with the basic rules surrounding English written grammar rules should fix those problems. \n It will do you well to learn about what words are non- academic. That way, you will not mistakenly use therein your presentation. Words like etc. should be avoided, specially at the end of a sentence since it cuts the understandability and discussion flow of the sentence. Always have a solid sentence close. \n <quotation>cycling is getting fader in users' minds</quotation> \n This more of a sentence structure error due to incorrect word usage. I understand what you want to say but have to score you down because of GRA requirements. A more appropriate wording would be: \n ... is slowly fading from commuters minds.","Your essay presents an insightful discussion on the decline of cycling as a popular mode of transportation and proposes some thought-provoking solutions to this issue. To help you improve your essay, let's address some specific aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic**: You have understood the topic well and provided a clear argument on the reasons cycling is becoming less popular and offered solutions. This shows your ability to engage with the topic effectively.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few areas where your grammar and word choice could be improved to enhance clarity and make your essay more academically appropriate. For example:
   - Avoid using non-academic words and phrases such as ""etc."" at the end of sentences, as they can disrupt the flow and clarity of your argument. Instead, be more specific or conclude your thoughts more definitively.
   - The phrase ""cycling is getting fader in users' minds"" could be more accurately expressed as ""cycling is slowly fading from commuters' minds."" This correction improves the sentence structure and clarity.
   - Pay attention to capitalization and the correct use of punctuation marks. For example, ""It"" after a comma should not be capitalized unless it begins a new sentence.
   - Work on using articles (""a"", ""an"", ""the"") correctly, as missing or misused articles can make sentences difficult to understand.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is generally clear, but sometimes the flow of your essay might be hindered by grammatical inaccuracies. Strengthening your grammar will help in presenting your arguments more coherently and persuasively.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your arguments are thoughtful, but ensure each point is clearly supported by specific examples or evidence. When proposing solutions, explain how these actions could effectively increase cycling's popularity. For example, when discussing the increase in price of fuel and vehicle taxes as a deterrent, elaborate on how this could feasibly lead to a significant shift towards cycling.

To further enhance your essay, consider these additional suggestions:
- Introduce varied sentence structures to make your writing more engaging.
- Ensure there is a logical flow between paragraphs and ideas. Using transitional phrases can help bridge thoughts smoothly.
- Pay closer attention to the precision of language. Avoid vague terms when specifics would make your point stronger.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly improve the coherence, clarity, and impact of your essays.

What are the causes of this?,"Childhood obesity tends to become a serious public health challenge in many countries. This essay will look at the primary causes of this trend and suggest some possible solutions to tackle this problem. \n There are a number of reasons for the rising level of childhood obesity. The first reason is unhealthy eating habits. Children nowadays tend to consume too much fast food such as candy, snack and sugary drinks. It causes them to gain weight quickly as they are containing very high in fat and sugar but low in vitamins and minerals. Another reason is sedentary lifestyles. Children spend all of their own time watching TV, browsing the Internet or playing video games instead of going outside and doing sports. As a consequence, they are becoming increasingly obese. \n There are several actions that could be taken to mitigate the issues mentioned above. Firstly, parents need to control what their children eat and make sure that they have a healthy diet. Educating kids about the detrimental effects of an imbalanced diet is considerable. Unhealthy junk food should be banned from the school menu and fast food advertising need to be limitted. Secondly, parents should restrict the time their children using for sedentary activities and encourage them to take regular exercise, which would help them to control their weight by burning calories. Physical education would help them to avoid assembling fat. \n To sum up, there are various factors leading to the rise in childhood obesity, and measures should be taken to solve this problem.","Since the original prompt, which the person above failed to consider, does ask for the problem statement, causes of the problem, effects, and possible solutions, you actually followed the prompt requirements as indicated. This is what I mean by students who are not familiar with the essay topics should never pretend to be an authority or offer advice when it can definitely be wrong and simply mislead other students, who are also learners themselves. If one is not familiar with the topic, then one should simply refrain from giving advice as it could lead to mistaken reviews and irrelevant advice. \n As for the opening paragraph, you should have completed the restatement within 5 sentences maximum, or at least 3 sentences. You should have represented an actual reference to the reasoning topics that were to follow. So outline your discussion. Your first sentence, the actual paraphrase, still uses the original reference phrase in relation to ""many countries"". An error that will appear as memorized phrase usage in an actual test. The lack of an outlined discussion in response to the discussion instructions will also affect the first part of your scoring situation as the examiner does not have a solid reference point for your English comprehension skills. Next time, outline your response topics. \n Your cause and effect in the first reasoning paragraph is good. The problem, is that you failed to offer a solution within the same paragraph so that it could have followed the expected format of: \n - Cause of obesity \n - Reason for this cause \n - Possible solution \n - Example / justification that supports your suggested solution \n - Additional explanation / Transition sentence \n Although you tried to do that in this essay, the fact that you used 2 topics per paragraph is what forced the discussion format error on your part. Use only 1 topic per paragraph and completely develop that topic based on the above format. That will help you boost your C&C score as you properly connected the discussion requirements for the essay in one paragraph. The 2 reasoning paragraphs become well presented and properly developed in that instance. \n As for the conclusion. That is never a single sentence. You should always restate the previous discussion topic, summarize the causes, effects, and then, close with a strong repetition of your suggested solution(s). That will help you properly represent the reverse paraphrase.","This essay adequately addresses the topic by exploring the primary causes of childhood obesity and suggesting possible solutions, which is in line with the prompt's requirements. However, there is room for improvement in various aspects to enhance the essay's overall effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
Your essay aligns with the prompt by discussing the causes and proposing solutions for childhood obesity. However, the introduction could be more impactful by briefly outlining the main points that will be discussed. This not only aids in clarity but also demonstrates comprehension skills better. Aim for an introduction that contains three to five sentences, summarizing the essay's argument and mentioning the causes and solutions you plan to discuss.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
Overall, the essay is well-written, but watch out for minor grammatical errors and ensure smooth transitions between sentences. For example, consider revising phrases like ""Children spend all of their own time..."" to ""Children spend all their time..."" which is more direct and clear. Paying attention to these details will refine the essay's quality.

3. **Author’s Point of View:**
Your point of view is clear throughout the essay, as you identify the seriousness of childhood obesity and emphasize actionable solutions. Maintaining this clarity is crucial, so continue to ensure that your position on the issue is apparent from the introduction through to the conclusion.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
Your chief strengths lie in identifying causes and suggesting solutions. However, the development of your ideas could be more comprehensive. Instead of addressing multiple topics in one paragraph, focus on fully exploring one topic per paragraph. This should encompass: the cause, its reason, a proposed solution, an example or justification for your solution, and a concluding sentence that transitions to the next point. This structure would not only improve clarity but also enhance the coherence and cohesion of your essay.

5. **Conclusion:**
The conclusion should be more than a single sentence. It's an opportunity to restate your main points, summarize the discussed causes and effects, and reiterate your proposed solutions. Aim for a conclusive paragraph that encapsulates your essay's argument and leaves a lasting impression.

Remember, consistent practice and attention to these areas will not only improve this essay but also enhance your writing skills over time. You have a solid foundation; focusing on development, clarity, and structure will bring significant improvements.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

While some people believe that this will bring many problems, I personally think that this trend will provide more benefits for societies and women. \n First of all, the law and policy based on justice which is compitable for woman will massively be created. This happens as without being restricted, female are able to get involved in the political sectors. Thus, they are able to represent woman in order to make and determine some beneficial and friendly policies for woman. Another benefit is the woman contribution for country' development through some particular fields. This is as a result of female participation in the such sectors in which they are used to unable to prove their prticular skills or talents. For instance, many female contribute and enhance the productivity in education, healthcare, science. technology and even economic sectors. \n Looking at another perspective, it is true that woman participation in many sector can discourage their role in educating and supervising children at home. Thus, their children will inevitably commit the deliquent activities. However, I believe thet both male and female have the same-essential role in handling and educating the children, and balancing the role in the workplace and domestic should become responsibillities for both parents. \n In conclusion, I believe that the wide-ranged chances for female to contribute in many sectors can be good news for all individuals because not only this trend is compitable with human right in equality but also this will bring many merits for the country.","You are being asked to present 2 opinions on the given matter. You are not being asked to discuss the benefits of the topic in the essay. After presenting a prompt restatement, your final 2 sentences should have presented an outline of the discussion topic. You should have presented 2 separate sentences that indicated the opinions you would have discussed in the reasoning paragraphs. So your implementation of the discussion instructions is incorrect. This is a direct opinion essay that requires you to outline your discussion for the benefit of the examiner, who can judge your English comprehension and GRA skills at this point, and yours, as it allows you to keep a reference point for your discussion presentation. It will prevent you from discussing non-related information in the essay. \n An apostrophe is only used either with an S ('S) to represent ownership. However, an apostrophe may also be used when a word ends with an S originally, also indicating ownership. It is never used without the letter S present.

Your English presentation in this essay is beginner at best, failing to actually represent what you want to say, which was probably understandable in your native language, but not in English. These coherence and cohesiveness problems are the main reason that the essay will not achieve a passing score. I can see that you have an opinion, you just aren't explaining it clearly or properly in the presentation.","Your essay on the increased opportunities for women in modern life and its impact on society is a good topic but needs some adjustments to more accurately respond to the essay question. The essay is meant to present two different opinions on the issue, but it seems like you've focused more on the benefits rather than presenting two distinct viewpoints. This can confuse readers about the essay's objective.

Firstly, the introduction should briefly mention both sides of the argument to give a clear outline of what will be discussed. This approach will help keep your essay focused and make it easier for readers to follow your arguments. Remember, the aim is to discuss two contrasting opinions, not just the positive aspects.

Regarding language use, there are a few areas that require attention:
- Make sure to use the apostrophe correctly. For example, ""country'"" should be ""country's"" when indicating possession.
- The word ""undoubtful"" is not commonly used in this context; ""undoubtedly"" would be a better choice.
- ""Compitable"" seems to be a misspelling of ""compatible"". 
- Pay attention to the difference between ""woman"" (singular) and ""women"" (plural) and use them correctly according to the context.
- Try to avoid repetitive phrases and aim for more varied vocabulary to make your essay more engaging.

Your essay currently struggles with clarity and coherence, meaning it's sometimes hard to understand exactly what you're trying to say. To improve clarity, work on linking your ideas more smoothly and make sure each sentence contributes clearly to your argument. This will help you present your opinions in a more structured and understandable manner.

Moreover, while you present an opinion, the way it's expressed makes it challenging for readers familiar with English to fully grasp your points. Consider simplifying your sentences and focusing on one idea at a time. This will not only make your writing clearer but also ensure your thoughts are more easily understood.

Remember, the goal of this essay is not just to share your views but to communicate them effectively in English. Practice constructing sentences carefully to better convey your arguments and ideas. This will go a long way in making your essay more coherent and engaging.

Lastly, your conclusion does a good job of restating your stance, but remember to reflect back on the two viewpoints discussed in the essay. This encapsulation will strengthen your closing remarks and leave a lasting impression on your readers.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of your essays in future. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek help or use resources to improve your English writing skills.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4670,https://essayforum.com/writing/reasons-rising-wealth-inequality-problems-90463/,dev,What are the reasons for rising wealth inequality and what problems could it cause?,"In contemporary world, the wealth inequality has been a significant phenomenon, which gives rise to numerous jeopardies for the humankind. The precursors of this problem, additionally, are associated with many facts in the modern society, in which low-income members of the population are still bias treated. Therefore, through this essay, causes and drawbacks of this issue will be analysed. \n First of all, the most predominant root should be mentioned is that there is still a majority part of the labor, particularly blue-collar workers, are paid unsuitably with their sacrifices. Those employees, thus, can only afford necessary commodities but do not have any extra savings for future demands, especially for emergency medical treatments. Moreover, inflation is also responsible for the problem of wealth inequality as it put people with low incomes in jeopardy by decreasing the value of tenuous properties that they hold for saving purpose. In the Covid-19 epidemic, for instance, the prices of ample products like foods, vegetables or petroleum increases dramatically while incomes of almost employees decrease because of closing policies or the purpose of saving fees of companies. \n Consequently, this phenomenon is conducive to remarkable results which are harmful for individuals and society in whole. Firstly, it is responsible for numerous humanitarian crisis such as poverty, illiteracy and gender inequality that could demolish the civilization of the humankind in long-term. Secondly, this problem may recall the society of colonialism in which the wealth considers the power of a person or a country. The development of the globe, as result, could be interfered or even worse face with the possibility of a reduction, which correlates with the increase of criminals and anti-social behaviors. \n In conclusion, there are evidences that wealth inequality is a paramount social phenomenon that the world is dealing with. Therefore, the authorities should spend enough awareness in researching for measures of that issue as a survival target. In addition, individuals also have duties in tackling this global issue as well as establishing a better society for all.","The prompt restatement is an inaccurate, and therefore, invalid representation of the original prompt. It fails to deliver a representation suited to the provided topic, discussion reason, and format. This topic does not suit the discussion. It is irrelevant to the original presentation. \n The original prompt relates to wealth inequality sans the reasons provided in the first paragraph interpretation of the writer. Such misrepresentations alter the original topic and, as seen in this essay, tends to change the discussion instruction as well. \n The instruction falls under the writing format of cause and solution. The writer developed a discussion based on causes and disadvantages instead. The essay will recieve a failed score due to the unrelated response provided. \n Although scoring will still be provided selectively based on the cause response, it will not be enough to total a passing score due to the non-related drawbacks discussion.","The essay addresses the topic of wealth inequality and its consequences, which is a crucial subject. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to make the essay more effective and aligned with the topic's requirements. Below is detailed feedback focusing on responsiveness to the topic, spelling, grammar, stylistic issues, clarity of the author's point of view, and the arguments provided.

1. **Responsiveness to the Topic:**
The essay seems to slightly misinterpret the original prompt by emphasizing causes and negative effects of wealth inequality rather than focusing on causes and potential solutions. It's important to carefully read the prompt and ensure that the essay directly answers the questions or themes presented. To improve, reconsider the essay structure by including specific solutions to address wealth inequality alongside its causes.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow and clarity of the essay. For example, ""bias treated"" should be ""biased treatment,"" and ""majority part of the labor"" could be simplified to ""a majority of laborers."" Also, phrases like ""ampl[e] products like foods, vegetables or petroleum increases"" should be revised for both accuracy and plurality agreement (e.g., ""the prices of many products, such as food, vegetables, and petroleum, have increased dramatically""). Consider revising sentences for simplicity and correctness. Utilizing grammar checking tools or consulting grammar guides could be very beneficial.

3. **Point of View Clarity:**
The point of view is generally clear; the author believes wealth inequality is a significant problem with deep-rooted causes and severe consequences. However, the essay could strengthen its stance by being more direct in proposing solutions, making the point of view not just analytical but also prescriptive.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
The arguments made about the causes of wealth inequality, such as inadequate compensation for blue-collar workers and inflation, are compelling. However, the discussion on the consequences overshadows potential solutions. Enhancing the essay with concrete, actionable solutions after discussing causes would offer a balanced view. For instance, suggesting policies to improve wage laws or financial literacy among low-income populations could be viable solutions worth exploring.

In summary, it is commendable to tackle such a complex issue as wealth inequality. To refine the essay, focus on aligning more closely with the prompt's requirements by addressing both causes and solutions, simplifying language for clarity, correcting grammatical errors, and balancing the analysis of problems with suggestions for improvement. By making these adjustments, the essay will not only be more coherent but also provide a more comprehensive perspective on an important social issue.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

The writing effectively informs us about the transformation in the school's structure and facilities, focusing on significant developments like the sports field, car park, and science block.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the task of describing changes over time based on maps of a school's development. It successfully outlines the main transformations and additions to the facility. However, for a clearer response, it's essential to ensure all details are accurately connected to the maps discussed. Without access to the images, it's challenging to verify the precision of the description. Including specific examples or clearer transitions between each time period could enhance the response to the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few areas where attention to spelling and grammar will improve the essay. The word ""playground"" is misspelled as ""playround."" Attention to singular and plural forms is needed, especially with nouns (""sports field"" vs. ""sports fields""). Additionally, consider choosing more precise words for clarity (""previous farmland"" could be ""earlier farmland""). The essay would benefit from reviewing these rules to avoid similar mistakes.

3. **Point of View**: The essay maintains an objective point of view, suitable for a report on changes observed in maps. The transition in the final paragraph introducing the perspective of adults and students provides a personal touch, making the impact of these changes more tangible. However, ensure that this shift is clearly introduced and supported with specific details to reinforce the argument.

4. **Arguments and Position**: The essay outlines changes but could further strengthen the argument by discussing the implications of these changes more thoroughly. For instance, explaining how the reduction in sports field size affects student activities could provide a clearer position on the matter. Providing specific examples or data, even hypothetical, could deepen the analysis and make the argument more persuasive.

In summary, the essay demonstrates a good foundation in reporting changes over time based on maps. Improvements in spelling and grammar, as well as deeper exploration of the implications of these changes, will enhance the effectiveness of the essay. While the descriptive elements are strong, focussing on accuracy, clarity, and a richer analysis of the impacts of these developments will create a more compelling narrative.",3,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2,1,Informative

It is clear that there is an understanding of how exercise can improve a person's life. However, to make the essay stronger and more effective, there are several areas that can be improved.

Firstly, the organization of the essay could be enhanced. Currently, the ideas are presented in a single block of text which makes it difficult for readers to distinguish between the different points being made. It would be more effective to divide the essay into separate paragraphs, each focusing on a different aspect of how exercise benefits health. For example, one paragraph could discuss weight control, another could examine how exercise helps with specific health conditions, and a third could explore the mental health benefits. This approach would not only make the essay easier to read but would also allow for a deeper discussion of each point.

Additionally, the introduction could be expanded to better engage the reader. Providing more background information, possibly including statistics or a personal anecdote, could make the introduction more interesting and compelling. An engaging introduction sets the tone for the entire essay and motivates the reader to continue.

While the essay does have clear arguments that support the positive effects of regular exercise, these could be strengthened with more detailed examples and evidence. For instance, when mentioning the diseases that exercise can help prevent or manage, including specific studies or statistics can make the argument more convincing.

There are a few minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay that should be addressed. For example, ensuring subject-verb agreement and checking the use of articles can improve the readability of the essay. Also, paying attention to the correct spelling of words (e.g., ""consider"" instead of ""concider"") will enhance the professionalism of the writing.

Finally, the conclusion effectively summarizes the main points but could also include a more impactful final thought or call to action. Encouraging the reader to think about how they can incorporate more exercise into their own life or reflecting on the broader implications of a sedentary lifestyle could provide a strong finish to the essay.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but would benefit from improved organization, expanded introduction, clearer development of ideas with supporting evidence, correction of minor errors, and a more engaging conclusion. These changes would greatly improve the effectiveness of the essay and its ability to communicate the importance of regular exercise.",3,4,3,4,2,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Secondly, in custody prisoners are prepared to be better citizens when they are released. For example, a huge number of prisons apply the rehabilitation programme, in which prisoners receive education and learn some valuable life skills. Finally, long prison sentences can deter offenders from re-offending crimes again. Because they will realise the value of freedom, therefore, they will think again before breaking the law in the future. \n The alternatives to imprisonment would be much less effective. One option would be to apply fines as punishment for crimes. The downside of this method is that some wealthier might deliberately commit offences when they feel they can easily afford the price. Another option would be to require offenders to do community service. Although this way of punishment might be considered to be beneficial for society, but it also could be downright risky. Because we cannot trust the behaviours of not rehabilitated criminals, thus, by doing this we endanger the community. \n In conclusion, I believe that the best punishment for criminals is to imprison them, and that all other alternatives are unreliable.","Dear student, please review your summary overview. It is going to get a failing mark in an actual test because of the extreme shortness of your summary. The standard overview is composed of 3 sentences at a minimum. You have only one sentence, which is definitely in violation of the rules. The highest score you can get in terms of task accuracy would most likely be a 4. Keep in mind that you have to paraphrase the original prompt and as such, you have the opportunity to express the prompt in an original manner, within the minimum sentence requirement. Don't waste your chance to get a high score in the first part of the test. Make sure you deliver on the paraphrased prompt requirement. \n In relation to that, you have also presented the same problem with your conclusion. There is no proper paragraph development. Instead, you have a single sentence that does not properly recap the essay prompt, your discussion, and closing statement. While you have the possibility of scoring a 5 in the remaining sections of the test, the problem with your opening statement and closing statement is enough to pull down your final score. \n Review the other essays here and look at how it was developed. Don't take shortcuts. Be as thorough as you can in the opening and closing statement because any mistakes in those areas will have a grave effect on your final score.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by arguing that imprisonment is the most effective form of punishment for offenders. However, there are areas in this essay that can be improved to make your argument stronger and your writing clearer.

Firstly, it's crucial to expand both your introductory and concluding paragraphs. The opening sentence should paraphrase the original essay prompt to set the stage for your argument, using at least three sentences. This not only helps in meeting standard requirements but also gives you the chance to present your viewpoint in an original and engaging manner right from the start.

Similarly, your conclusion currently lacks development. A strong concluding paragraph should recap your discussion and reinforce your overall argument in a nuanced way, again ideally spread across at least three sentences. This will ensure you properly summarize your points and strengthen the impact of your essay’s message.

Throughout your essay, you've made clear and descriptive arguments supporting your viewpoint on the importance of prison as a form of punishment. You’ve effectively highlighted the benefits of imprisonment, such as protecting society, rehabilitating prisoners, and deterring crime through education and life skills programs. However, when discussing the alternatives to imprisonment, be cautious not to oversimplify. For example, when you mention community service as potentially ""downright risky,"" it would be beneficial to provide more evidence or explanation to support this claim.

On the grammar and language use, your essay is generally well-written, but watch out for minor errors and sentence structure. Specifically, be mindful of run-on sentences and ensure each sentence is clear and concise. For instance, consider breaking longer sentences into shorter ones to improve readability.

Also, pay attention to the consistency of your arguments. At times, the transition between ideas could be smoother. Using transitional phrases can help guide your reader through your arguments more seamlessly.

Finally, keep working on refining your essay's voice to make sure it remains clear and authoritative throughout. Your point of view is evident but enhancing your language clarity and varying your sentence structures can make your arguments even more compelling.

By focusing on these areas—expanding your introduction and conclusion, supporting your claims with clear evidence, and refining your grammar and style—your essay will become stronger and more convincing. Keep practicing and reviewing other essays to improve your writing skills even further.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

You need to shorten this response to indicate what you want to learn, one simple reason why you want to learn how to do it, and how the organization can help you achieve that. You do not really address that in your response. The point of the question is to receive a response that shows how familiar you are with the helpful programs of the organization. Be specific with your plans for improvement through their help. Right now, you could be talking about any similar organization and not this one specifically. \n 2. Use a comma between the words management and because. Then replace the word ""because"" with ""since"" to connect the two ideas leading into ""I like organizing events..."" \n 3. Your strengths and weaknesses should reflect abilities that can be useful to the organization you are looking to become a part of. What you describe here are character traits that do not necessarily translate into a strength nor a weakness. Think about what the organization objectives are and what aspects you can help strengthen in the group and what aspects you can help in but are not very skilled in accomplishing. Those are actual strengths and weaknesses. It is all about explaining how you can help enhance the experience of being a member of the organization. \n 4. Your response is not really considered a failure. What you indicated is more of an apprehension. A failure is something that you actually did which did not turn out to have a positive result. How you overcame that failure explains how you turned the negative result or experience into a positive one. You should change your response to this question to a more relevant one.","Your essay provides a good insight into your desire to improve communication skills, work effectively, and your interest in project management. Also, your honesty in sharing personal strengths, weaknesses, and experiences is commendable. However, there are some areas that could be improved to make your essay even stronger and more aligned with the objectives of the organization you're interested in. Here are some specific suggestions:

1. **Conciseness and Relevance**: It's important to provide a clear and focused response. Try to succinctly state what you want to learn, why you want to learn it, and how the organization can assist you in achieving this. This will demonstrate your familiarity with the organization's programs and how they align with your personal development goals. Consider mentioning specific features or programs of the organization that attracted you and explain how they can help you improve on your areas of interest.

2. **Grammar and Style**: When connecting ideas, ensure your grammar aids the clarity of your message. For instance, in your essay, a comma is needed to correctly join phrases for better readability, especially when shifting from explaining your future field to the reason behind your choice. Additionally, using ""since"" instead of ""because"" could create a smoother transition between your statements.

3. **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Your essay should reflect on abilities that could contribute to the organization alongside areas you wish to develop. While character traits like respectfulness and honesty are valuable, consider focusing on skills directly related to the organization's goals and how these can either be an asset or an area for improvement within the group's context. This not only shows self-awareness but also how you envision contributing to and growing within the organization.

4. **Failure and Growth**: The segment about your past experiences should ideally showcase a specific instance where things didn't go as planned and what you learned from it. Try to recount an actual event of failure rather than apprehension or regret, and describe how you turned that experience into a positive learning opportunity. This shows resilience and the ability to grow from challenges, qualities that are highly regarded in any organizational setting.

Overall, your essay has the foundation of a thoughtful and introspective reflection. By refining your focus on the specific requirements of the organization, enhancing the clarity and relevance of your strengths and experience, and fine-tuning the language for better readability, your essay can become a powerful testament to your readiness to learn, grow, and contribute to the organization meaningfully.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Letter

The Task 2 essay always has a minimum of 2 body paragraphs. That is because you are expected to use at least 2 reasons, fully explained in stand alone paragraphs, to defend your position on the given topic. Your prompt paraphrase should have been composed of 5 sentences. That is because there is a requirement to paraphrase: \n - The topic \n - POV 1 on the topic \n - POV 2 on the topic \n - Your position \n - Transition sentence \n You did not completely provide a correct paraphrase in the introduction. It is only partially correct in presentation. Your reasoning paragraph 1 contains 2 reasons. Since you were already counting out your reasons, you should have used the second reason in a separate stand alone paragraph. While your reasoning is not incorrect, it is not fully explained either. That is why you are required to separate your reasons and use topic sentences instead of numerical counts at the start of each paragraph.

""Railways"" connote a plural reference so the subject-verb agreement should be ""are"" instead of ""is"". There are other existing problems in your essay but those are negligible enough to not have a direct effect on your score. The grammar is imperfect but you remain understood throughout the presentation, which is all that counts towards a good GRA score.","The essay demonstrates a clear position on the topic, arguing that governments should prioritize funding for railway construction over road construction. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the argument.

1. **Essay Structure and Development**:
   - **Introduction**: The introduction should more accurately paraphrase the prompt, covering the given topic from multiple perspectives before stating your own position. A well-structured introduction serves as a roadmap for your essay, including a transition sentence that leads into the body paragraphs.
   - **Body Paragraphs**: It's essential to separate your reasons into individual paragraphs, each with its topic sentence. This essay combines two reasons into one paragraph, which can make the argument less clear and harder to follow. By dividing them and fully explaining each reason in its paragraph, your ideas will have more impact.
   - **Conclusion**: The essay lacks a proper conclusion. A strong conclusion summarizes your main reasons and restates your position, providing a clear end to your argument. This is crucial for making your essay feel complete and persuasive.

2. **Language Use and Conventions**:
   - **Grammar and Syntax**: Be attentive to subject-verb agreement. For example, ""railways"" should be followed by ""are"" instead of ""is"" since it is a plural noun. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to improve readability and engagement.
   - **Spelling**: Since the preference in this context is for British English, be mindful of spelling differences (e.g., ""center"" should be ""centre""). Adhering to the correct English variant can positively affect your score.
   - **Clarity and Style**: Aim for clearer expression and specificity in your writing. Some sentences are awkward or confusing, potentially making it hard for readers to follow your argument. Simplifying language and using direct statements can enhance clarity.

3. **Argumentation**:
   - The essay provides reasons supporting the focus on railways, which is good. However, expanding on these reasons with more detailed examples or evidence could strengthen the argument. Additionally, consider addressing potential counterarguments to show a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

In summary, refining the essay's structure, paying closer attention to language use, and developing arguments more fully will significantly improve the effectiveness of your writing.

However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, relevance, and adherence to English writing standards. Let's explore these areas:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The introduction mentions parents' perspectives, which deviates from the original discussion points. It's important to stick to the subject by discussing the general viewpoints without introducing unrelated parties like parents unless the essay prompt specifically asks for it. Focus on presenting a balanced view of the given perspectives without adding external opinions not requested by the prompt.

2. **Clarity of Point of View:** The essay slightly strays from directly stating your own viewpoint. When discussing differing opinions, it's crucial to clearly state your personal stance on the matter. The conclusion hints at a preference but integrating your perspective more distinctly throughout the essay will make it stronger and more coherent.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay has multiple instances of incorrect capitalization, which disrupts the reading flow and demonstrates a misunderstanding of English grammar rules related to proper nouns and sentence beginnings. For example, words like ""In"" and ""On"" are capitalized inappropriately within sentences. Addressing these issues is essential for adhering to proper English writing standards.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** Your essay presents arguments for both sides of the discussion but lacks depth in some areas. For instance, mentioning Bill Gates without elaborating on how his work experience contributed to his success leaves the argument incomplete. Providing more detailed examples and explanations would strengthen your arguments.

5. **Writing Mechanics:** It's necessary to improve your understanding of English writing basics, including the use of capital letters, punctuation, and sentence structure. Practicing these fundamentals will not only improve your grammar, spelling, and punctuation but also enhance the overall coherence and readability of your essays.  

Improving in these areas will make your essays more compelling and clearer.

Viewing from a pragmatic lens, I totally agree with the aforementioned point of view. \n In fact, intended usage is a prerequisite factor in a functional structure. Apparently, each building has its own purpose and particular design to serve them. For this reason, buckling down to the utilities is of paramount importance. Take the construction of a school as an example. When designing it, the architect will meet the requirements regarding study rooms, large parking spaces, and other necessities for people with disabilities. The benefits of this allocation will be manifested in the joy of students and teachers when attending schools as well as an improvement in educational quality. Additionally, when people decide to visit a building, they often aim at what it offers inside in lieu of the external attraction. At this point in time, the intentional utility of the assets must be prioritized. \n Although palatial structure may appear attractive to bystanders at first glance, what it fails to consider is the exorbitant decorating cost and being less utilitarian. Apparently, there is no rationale for wasting money on a building that serves no purpose, let alone decorating it. To elucidate, a functional house satisfying our needs will be more pragmatic than a colorful painted wall, as the outward attraction cannot compensate for the amenities lacking in that estate. Moreover, since trends come and go, the perception of aesthetics will change over time. For this reason, well-decorated architecture of this time will soon be outdated. To demonstrate, wood paneling was fabulous in the 1970s, and to this day, houses are rarely structured like this. In this point of fact, function is the imperative aspect in constructing buildings, as the need for convenience is eternal. \n To reiterate, how the estate works is critical for utilization, as it will dictate the usefulness of that structure.","The presentation is a bit too long at 326 words. Remember the 40 minute limitation within which the writer still has to review, rewrite, and finalize the content of the essay, Focusing unnecessarily on a long discussion wherein the primary focus of the writer is on the lexical resource score, which is not one of the primary scoring considerations creates this essay of dictionary based words, but lacking in presentation clarity. The examiner is looking for conversational use of everyday English words. He is not looking for an essay that will require him to pull out a dictionary to refer to because of the use of archaic words. The essay needs to be written in a manner that is understandable to people of all ages, not historical English vocabulary experts. While the writer does present a valid argument, his use of vocabulary lessens the impact of the presentation. He set out to impress based solely on vocabulary instead of the heavier scoring aspects of the rubic.","The essay successfully addresses the topic, presenting a clear viewpoint that prioritizes the functional utility of buildings over their aesthetic appeal. This central argument is effectively supported through concrete examples, such as the design considerations of a school to meet specific needs. This strong alignment with the topic and the development of arguments are positive aspects of the essay.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed:

1. **Brevity and Clarity:** The essay is somewhat lengthy and occasionally uses complicated words and phrases. Considering time constraints and the goal of clear communication, it's advisable to make points more concisely. Aim to express your ideas in a simpler, more direct manner that is easily understood by a broad audience. Reducing the length of the essay to focus on key arguments without losing their depth would also be beneficial.

2. **Vocabulary Usage:** While a rich vocabulary can enhance an essay, overusing complex or less common words can make the text difficult to understand. The goal is to communicate ideas effectively, which often means using familiar, everyday language. Avoid the temptation to impress solely through word choice. Instead, focus on how convincingly and clearly you can convey your ideas. This approach will make your essay more accessible and engaging to readers, including examiners who value simplicity and clarity in expression.

3. **Grammar and Style:** The essay demonstrates a good use of grammar and stylistic elements, though there are minor areas that could be improved for smoother readability. Occasionally, sentence structures are overly complex, which can hinder the flow of reading. Practicing the use of varied but not overly complex sentence structures could enhance the overall readability.

4. **Point of View:** The essay's point of view is clear and consistently maintained throughout, which is a strength. Continuing to ensure that your perspective is clearly presented and remains the focus of your writing will serve you well in future essays.

Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. \n To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion ? \n Answer: \n It is sometimes argued that annual easing up some languages will facilitate people's easier lives. While I disagree with the idea of eliminating unpopular linguistic saying, I do believe that fewer languages could improve the global economy. \n On the one hand, language is the method of human communication, used by a particular country or community and interpreting for the internal characteristics. Therefore, individual languages acquire a reputation for national linguistic culture. Through analyzing the unique semantic factors, we could find out something valuable about ancient history, tradition, character, and so on. Besides, using the same language shows our respect for our original ancestral and cement nationally empathetic citizenship. For example, Japanese companies always give priority to those who could use Japanese coherently instead of those with impressive other languages. \n On the other hand, such economic globalization varying all over the world leads to widespread popular language like English, Chinese, French... in several countries. This will motivate external trades among countries, putting the global relationship under cultivation as well as developing countries' importing modern technology from prospering ones. Moreover, we could easily widen our connections with foreign friends around the globe through social means and popular languages. Communicating in the same language makes way for each member of international organizations, known as WHO, WTO, UN and the like, to share their own opinions and work in collaboration. \n In conclusion, consensus languages are key to accomplish advanced knowledge to upgrade the living conditions.

It will be easier to explain your mistakes and correcting the errors should be self explanatory on your part. \n TA - 4 \n The response you gave is not the correct response to the question and your explanation or prompt paraphrase is unclear, confusing, and unrelated to the task. Your actual discussion is divided, using unrelated topics, which created an incoherent and non-cohesive paragraph presentation. Let me show a sample of a more pointed response to the essay: \n <em>It appears that numerous dialects become extinct as the years pass. This does not bother the population of the specific language dead nations. They believe that social interactions will become better when only a few dialects are spoken globally. I strongly oppose this belief due to a few personally observed factors.</em> \n As you can see from the sample, your restatement simply lacks clarity. Perhaps this is because you lack English language proficiency or, you are just over reaching with your vocabulary choices. Either way, you lowered your TA score because of it. \n Cohesiveness and Coherence - 3 \n Like I said, your overall work shows a lack of clarity in your explanation of reasons. You seem to be extra focused on your vocabulary usage rather than the clear expression of your explanation. By doing so, you have managed to create illogical paragraphs which do not clearly relay what you are thinking or the message you are trying to get across to the reader. There is a lack of relationship between sentences and paragraphs. You only provide reasons without properly presented explanations and supporting sentences. Several reasons do not create an understandable paragraph. A singular reason with a 5 sentence explanation will actually achieve that task. \n Lexical Resource - 3 \n Again, this relates to the lack of clarity in your essay presentation. Your word choices have made it difficult for the reader to actually understand what you are trying to say. Word choices have distorted the meaning of the paragraphs. \n GRA - 3 \n You are overusing the Oxford comma in your presentations. There is no proper mix of complex and simple sentences in your presentation. You are using ellipses (...) in an academic essay. Your sentence structures are faulty to the point that some sentences are difficult to understand. \n It is highly possible that based on your current scores, you could get anywhere between a 3 - 3.5 for this type of writing. It is still far from the 5 base score that exam takers are aiming for.","Your essay offers an interesting perspective on the topic of language extinction and its global implications. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and overall argumentation. Here is a detailed examination of these areas:

**1. Response to the Topic:**
Your essay attempts to address the issue of language extinction and its impact on global communication and economy. However, the connection to the prompt is somewhat unclear. The essay's introduction could be strengthened by directly stating whether you agree or disagree with the opinion presented in the prompt. A clearer stance would help guide your readers through your argument more effectively.

**2. Clarity and Coherence:**
Currently, the essay suffers from a lack of coherence between sentences and paragraphs. Each paragraph introduces several ideas but often fails to fully explain or connect these ideas to each other and the main argument. For a stronger essay, focus on providing a single main idea per paragraph and use multiple sentences to explain and support that idea clearly. This approach will help create a logical flow of information and make your argument more persuasive.

**3. Language Use and Vocabulary:**
While it's evident that there's an effort to use a wide range of vocabulary, sometimes the choice of words or phrases makes your argument harder to understand. It's important to balance using complex vocabulary with ensuring that your meaning is clear. Consider simplifying your language where necessary to ensure that your ideas are communicated effectively. Also, be mindful of English grammar rules, such as the proper use of commas and sentence structure, to further enhance clarity.

**4. Grammar and Style:**
The essay has instances of grammatical errors and overcomplicated sentence structures that obscure meaning. Aim for a mixture of simple and complex sentences to convey your points effectively. Avoid overusing commas and ensure each sentence is structured clearly to improve readability. Remember, clarity is key in academic writing, so it's better to convey your message in a straightforward manner than to lose meaning through overly complex sentences.

**5. Conclusion:**
Your conclusion effectively highlights the importance of balancing global communication with the preservation of linguistic diversity. To make your conclusion even stronger, reiterate your main argument and summarize how the evidence you provided supports your viewpoint. This reinforcement helps leave a lasting impression on your readers.

In summary, concentrating on these areas can substantially improve your essay. Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep writing, and you will see continuous improvement in your skills.",3,4,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, some people think that it is very hard to believe newsman or newswomen. In my personal thinking, I partly agree with this opinion by below following reasons and I will list down some characteristics which victorious reporters should have. \n On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why people should read news. These announcements can help people to broaden their knowledge by latest information which is updated quickly day by day. Furthermore, besides different topics, news also collect data and report in different countries . For example, US election can be known by all people through news, this was live reporting immediately when journalist got the result. On the other hand, some journalists in tabloid give wrong information by exaggerating the problem in these day. In addition, this information is not censored carefully. For instance, journalists try to get new details from super stars and then they write fictional stories by hot titles. \n For successful reporters, they should have honesty and passion for their job. First, journalists must face with messy information which is related to many people. Without honesty, they can change the truth before communicating in newspaper. For example, some corporations want to be famous by fake data which is given in newspaper, therefore, they can bribe reporters to do these wrong things. Secondly, journalists is hard job which needs to travel frequently and face with dangerous situation. This could depress their energy if they do not have enough enthusiasm for job. \n In conclusion, people should continue reading news, however they need to be conscious to select official newspaper. \n Moreover, honesty and passion are key qualities in order to become successful journalists.","Vo, your total approach to the essay is wrong.

However, there are a few areas that could benefit from improvement to better align with the essay prompt and to enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

Firstly, it's crucial to stay directly aligned with the essay prompt. The task was to discuss whether journalists can be trusted to report the truth. Instead, much of the essay focuses on the importance of reading the news, which diverges from the central question. To improve, ensure that each paragraph directly addresses the prompt. A more effective structure might include: restating the question, discussing the trustworthiness of journalists, listing necessary qualities for journalists, and concluding with a summary of your argument.

Regarding grammar and sentence structure, there are some issues that impact readability. For example, sentences like ""In this day and age, it is true that news can be brought a useful information in different categories such as economic, policy, and so on."" are a bit awkward. A clearer way to phrase this might be, ""In today's world, news provides useful information across various categories, including economics and politics."" Paying attention to verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure will make your writing more coherent. Additionally, try to avoid run-on sentences and ensure each sentence clearly expresses a single idea.

Your point of view is partially clear, but it could be strengthened by directly addressing the essay's prompt throughout the essay. Make sure your stance on the trustworthiness of journalists is explicit and supported by arguments and examples.

In terms of supporting your position, you've included examples and reasons, which is positive. However, the arguments could be more focused and directly relevant to the essay's question. For instance, discussing the issue of misinformation and how journalists can avoid it would directly address the question of their trustworthiness. Similarly, when listing qualities of a successful journalist, linking these qualities directly to how they build or erode trust would make your argument stronger and more cohesive.

To conclude, continuing to read broadly will enrich your understanding and ability to write about complex issues. Focusing on aligning with the essay prompt, improving grammatical accuracy, and structuring your essay to clearly support your viewpoint will greatly enhance the effectiveness of your writing. Remember, every piece of writing is an opportunity to improve and express your ideas more clearly.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

All these were more prohibitively expensive than in the country and this increases the financial pressure on them. Besides, living oversea makes students encounter differences in culture such as festivals, cuisines, lifestyles. This requires overseas students to need much time to adapt, which leads to neglect learning and low academic results. \n On the other hand, it seems to many people choosing to study abroad because of some undeniable advantages. Firstly, studying abroad provides students with opportunities to learn in top-ranked universities, where has excellent professors and modern learning equipment. This helps them to obtain specialized knowledge and an international learning environment. This makes it easier for them to get a well-paid job. Secondly, students had many opportunities to communicate with native citizens in various cultures. This improves social knowledge, English-speaking skill, and increases the likelihood of communicating. All these help students to become mature than on their peers. \n In conclusion, some citizens believe that there are many benefits to studying abroad, although this decision has come notable drawbacks.","You totally missed the point of the essay.

However, it's crucial to closely adhere to the essay prompt's requirement, which asks for a personal viewpoint on whether the benefits of studying abroad outweigh the drawbacks. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears that the essay didn't fully meet the assignment's instructions. The prompt asks for an analysis based on personal opinion, focusing on whether you believe the advantages of studying abroad surpass its disadvantages. It encourages a deeper exploration of your stance on the subject, supported by personal experiences or knowledge. Instead of comparing both sides equally, the essay should lean more towards the side you agree with, providing a clear argument for why you hold that belief.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are a few areas where the essay could benefit from improvements in spelling and grammar. For example, ""oversea"" should be ""overseas,"" and phrases like ""had to expenditure too much money"" could be more clearly expressed as ""have to spend too much money."" Additionally, varying your sentence structure could enhance the readability and engagement of your essay.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** While you present both sides of the argument—advantages and disadvantages—you do not clearly state your personal viewpoint. The essay should explicitly indicate whether you believe the benefits of studying abroad outweigh the challenges. Expressing a definitive stance will strengthen your essay by providing it with a clear direction.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your essay mentions several advantages and disadvantages to studying abroad. For a more effective argument, focus on elaborating these points with more detail, linking them to your personal perspective. Instead of listing reasons, delve into how these factors specifically influence your viewpoint. Use personal examples or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate your points more vividly.

To improve, consider selecting one side of the argument you feel more aligned with and expanding on that perspective, using your reasoning to show why the opposite view holds less weight in comparison. This structure will not only meet the essay's requirements more precisely but also provide a more compelling and focused argument.

4681,https://essayforum.com/writing/child-education-parents-social-institutions-76050/,dev,Child Education / Parents / Social Institutions,"The debate over whether children should be taught about moral lessons in a domestic or external environment has attracted international attention among both the professional and non-professional. While family upbringing, as supported by many, is an important contributor to a child's mannerism, the strong influence that schools have on the young generation cannot be ignored. In the essay, I would like to discuss both sides of the argument before presenting my own opinion. \n Those in favour of parental guidance on the proper behavioural tendency of a child propose a convincing line of reasoning. It is argued that since parents have been in close proximity of their children for a long time, they are more capable of instilling moral precepts in the young mind. Small children have a propensity to imitate behaviours of adult members in the family. Therefore, those brought up in homes where parents conduct in an appropriate manner are likely to mature into ethical citizens. Moreover, parents are in a better position to correct their children wrongful behaviours from the very beginning by imposing punishments or giving invaluable advice, thus preventing any potential unlawful acts conducted by them in the future. \n However, ideas outlined above are not supported by some who subscribe to the notion that schools should be mainly responsible for producing good members of the society. According to their point of view, children cannot forever live under parental protection and have to enter a whole new world at some point in their life. Education institutions will serve as a platform where children begin to make social contact with people from different backgrounds, through which they will develop many social skills and learn how to behave in an acceptable way. Furthermore, once entering the education system, a child must follow the regulations set by the school as well as obey his teachers' instructions. This will shape the conducting pattern in the young, supplying them with adequate necessary tools to step into the society. \n After considering both views, I am convinced that a joint effort by domestic and school education is essential for the development of desirable personality traits among the young. \n please help me with this essay.","Dear student, the opening statement which is supposed to be a paraphrasing of the original prompt is not very clear. The original prompt is related to the method by which a child can be taught to be a good member of society. Your restatement is all about the moral lessons that should be taught to a child. Teaching a moral lesson is not the same as teaching a child how to be a good member of society. A moral lesson is learned or taught after a mistake is made. Teaching a child to be a good member of society is taught on a continual basis, regardless of whether or not a mistake was made by the child. Your personal opinion must never be part of a conclusion. It should be a separate paragraph that is supported by evidence that will convince the reader of your stand on the given topic. The conclusion should only restate the prompt, the two sides discussed, and finally, a short representation of your personal opinion to close the essay. Based on these observations, the score of your essay will not be more than 4.","Your essay tackles an important debate: how children should learn to be good members of society, focusing on whether this education should come from home or school environments. This is a critical issue, and your attempt to explore both sides is commendable. However, there are specific areas where your essay could improve to make your argument clearer and more effective.

Firstly, there's some confusion in how your essay approaches the topic. You discuss moral lessons, which, although related, differ slightly from the broader concept of teaching a child how to be an integral part of society. Moral lessons often come after mistakes, implying a reactive approach, whereas educating a child to contribute positively to society is an ongoing process, proactive and comprehensive. Making this distinction clearer from the outset will help align your essay more closely with the prompt.

Regarding the structure and clarity of your argument, while you've presented insights on both parental and educational influences, integrating your viewpoint as a distinct, evidence-backed section before concluding could strengthen your essay. This delineation ensures that your analysis and opinion are both clear to the reader, enhancing the persuasive quality of your argument.

Your conclusion also needs a slight adjustment. While restating the prompt and acknowledging the discussed perspectives is essential, placing your opinion as a concise, summarizing thought can wrap up your discussion more effectively. This helps reaffirm your stance and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

On a positive note, your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the subject, and your language use is mostly clear and appropriate. However, watch out for minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could distract from your message. Phrases like ""in close proximity of"" could be simplified to ""close to"" for clarity and conciseness. Ensuring sentences flow smoothly and ideas are clearly articulated will make your argument more compelling.

Your effort to address this multifaceted topic shows promise. With careful refinement in aligning your essay more directly with the prompt, clarifying your viewpoint, and tidying up the structure and language, your work will surely engage and persuade your readers more effectively.

While the trend is justifiable to some extent, I would argue that it would do more harm than good in overall. \n The explanation behind this trend might involve a notion that job applicants who did well in educational institutions would also perform competently in workplaces. In other words, staffers possessing excellent academic records are believed to be more effective at work than those with ordinary academic performance. Given the fact that many employers tend to rush through things these days to ensure an advantageous position in the face of stiff competition, hence, they would be beneficial as more individuals with outstanding academic qualities are hired for the job. \n Although the role of academic qualities in term of staff recruitment is undeniable, this is not a sufficiently sound reason to ignore the importance of character traits and interpersonal skills when it comes to work. To be more specific, personal attributes, such as life experience and social skills, are truly essential in workplaces as they could help finding, attracting and retaining clients for businesses. Given the fact that modern market offers consumers an unlimited number of choices through technologies, hence, customer service is often what influences the choice to use a particular business. Besides, without soft skills, hard skills (academic qualities) alone are not enough to be truly effective. For example, a salesperson with excellent academic knowledge might have little success if he or she does not have the interpersonal skills needed to close deals and retain clients. \n In conclusion, while there is an understandable reason for the trend of giving emphasize academic qualities rather than personal qualities, I believe that it would be a negative development in long run.","Can, your opinion about this being a negative development should have been given in the opening paraphrase and restated in the closing summary.

A direct, simple sentence at the beginning that presents your opinion would set a clearer direction for your essay. Remember, the introduction is crucial for laying out the foundation of your argument and preparing the reader for your discussion points.

In terms of content, your essay makes a strong case for the value of social skills and personal qualities in the workplace. However, you need to ensure your arguments are clearly structured and coherently presented. There's a sentence in the second paragraph that appears incomplete and disrupts the flow of your argument. This sentence lacks clarity and does not effectively contribute to your overall discussion. To resolve this, consider restructuring it to ensure that each part of your essay seamlessly connects to the next, enhancing both clarity and coherence.

Additionally, your conclusion seems to continue the discussion rather than summarizing your main points. It's important to conclude your essay by reiterating your stance and summarizing the core arguments you've presented. This helps to provide a clear and impactful ending to your essay, reinforcing your position on the topic.

On a positive note, your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents relevant arguments to support your viewpoint.

That causes the generation gap, which is understood as the gap between different generations. It is not difficult for us to catch a generation gap between the old and the young in social life out there. Moreover, the generation gap also exists in our own home because of difficulty understanding, less communication, and differences in lifestyle. \n Many factors result in generational differences. First of all, every person has significantly different opinions. Having more experiences, parents occasionally imposed their thought on children and supposed that was the right thing. Don't let the child express their opinion, which makes a risk of high misunderstanding. \n Another serious factor is that they don't spend more family time with each other. Parents are working, children are at school and occupy with doing a huge amount of homework. At weekends, the teenager prefers hanging out with friends and getting a coffee than staying at home. According to the New York Post, American families get just 37 minutes of quality time per day, perhaps they just meet face-to-face at dinner time. \n Finally, while the young are fond of eating fast food such as KFC, Burger King, Lotte, etc, the old lean towards healthy food. Another example is that the young love to mix and match on-trend clothes, whereas the old supposed that is an exotic style, they like wearing casual clothes than becoming a slave of fashion. Age differences make them have different perspectives as well as different lifestyles. \n For these reasons, the generation gap will inevitably coexist with human life.

1. **Response to Topic**:
   Since the original prompt was not provided, it's crucial to ensure that the essay directly addresses the assigned question or topic. Essays should be carefully tailored to meet the requirements of the prompt, ensuring relevance and focus throughout.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:
   - Avoid informal language and contractions (e.g., use ""do not"" instead of ""don't""). Academic essays necessitate a formal tone.
   - The organization could be streamlined by avoiding phrases like ""First of all,"" which don't add value. Instead, directly list points as ""First,"" ""Second,"" and ""Finally,"" to maintain clarity and cohesion.
   - Work on varying vocabulary to enhance expression. Instead of repeating words like ""different,"" try synonyms such as ""various,"" ""separate,"" or ""contrasting,"" which can enrich the essay.
   - Be mindful of verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement to improve grammatical accuracy.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**:
   The point of view is generally clear, focusing on the generation gap's causes, effects, and solutions. However, clearer transitions and more explicit statements of opinion would strengthen the author's stance. Avoid ambiguity by directly stating your position and supporting it with concrete evidence and examples.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
   - The arguments presented are relevant but could be more compelling with additional support, such as statistics, research findings, or more detailed examples.
   - Enhance the argumentative structure by ensuring a logical progression from identifying the problem to analyzing its consequences, and then proposing solutions.
   - Increase the persuasiveness of the essay by including a balanced view that considers counterarguments or challenges to the presented solutions, then refute or mitigate these concerns.

A more suitable opening could have been, ""The debate on the minimum legal age for marriage, specifically if it should be at least 21, is significant. This essay will explore my disagreement with this view.""

2. **Grammar and Clarity**:
   There are several grammar issues across the essay that hinder understanding. For example, phrases like ""marriage should be occur"" should be corrected to ""marriage should occur."" Efforts to refine grammar will greatly enhance the clarity and delivery of your arguments. 

3. **Point of View**:
   The point of view starts clear with disagreement on young marriages but gets confusing with inconsistent arguments. It is vital to maintain a consistent stance throughout the essay. If the position is to disagree with marriage under 22, all arguments should uniformly support this stance.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**:
   The essay introduces arguments both for and against the stated position, which leads to confusion. Each paragraph should present a clear, well-supported reason aligned with your stance. For instance, discussing emotional instability in young marriages strengthens your viewpoint but then arguing that young people should marry because of their productivity contradicts your initial stance. Ensure each argument unambiguously supports your perspective.

5. **Simpler Language and Practice**:
   Practice writing with simpler language to build confidence and clarity in your expression. Start with topics that don't require strict adherence to essay standards, focusing on clear sentence construction and paragraph development. This approach can significantly aid in improving your comprehension and writing skills in English.

6. **Conclusion and Cohesion**:
   The conclusion should unequivocally summarize your stance without introducing new ideas. Avoid making broad statements like ""it is legal circumstance if people marriage at young age"" without clear preceding arguments. A better conclusion might reiterate your main reasons for the position taken, ensuring a cohesive end to your discussion.

Remember, the goal is to present a well-argued, coherent essay that reflects your understanding of the topic and showcases your ability to communicate effectively in English. Continuously work on your grammar, clarity of expression, and structure of argumentation to enhance your essays.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

The topic sentence, regarding what you will be writing about should be first (I'd like to talk about one of my days). Followed by what time your day starts ( I often get up), then the activity that starts your day (My mood is good when I start by studying English). The rest of the essay, about how you study and practice the English language can then follow. Remember that when you write an action paragraph, you need to outline the order in which these actions will be performed in the draft. Line then up from the first action, to the last. By doing so, you can develop a more understandable essay. If possible, avoid using English slang words (wanna) in your practice essays because you are not allowed to use slang words in academic writing. You might as well get used to it early on so that it does not become a habit for you.","Your essay presents a narrative of your daily routine, specifically focusing on your efforts to learn English. The ambition and dedication are commendable, and sharing your personal experiences offers a relatable and engaging approach. However, to elevate the quality of your essay and ensure it aligns more effectively with academic standards, there are a few areas for improvement.

Firstly, organizing your essay in a logical sequence would significantly enhance its clarity. Start with introducing the main topic or activity you plan to discuss, such as your daily routine or your process of learning English. Follow this by detailing the specific activities in the order they occur, beginning with the time you wake up and moving through your day. This structure will not only make your essay easier to follow but also more impactful.

Secondly, attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic choices is crucial. For instance, 'vocabularies' should be 'vocabulary' as it is typically an uncountable noun in English, and phrases like 'I wanna' should be replaced with 'I want to'. This shift from casual to more formal language is vital in academic writing. Remember, the precision of language reflects on the author and helps convey your points more effectively.

Regarding your point of view, it's clear you are motivated to learn English for future opportunities, which is a strong position. However, expanding on why exactly this is important to you, perhaps by describing specific job aspirations or how English proficiency can open doors, would deepen the reader's understanding of your perspective.

Lastly, while you briefly mention activities such as watching YouTube to improve your listening skills, elaborating on how these methods contribute to your learning or discussing any challenges you face could provide a fuller picture of your journey. Descriptive arguments that showcase your experiences, learnings, and outcomes from these activities can serve to support your viewpoint more robustly.

In summary, focusing on a clear, chronological structure, adhering to formal language standards, clarifying your motivation, and providing detailed support for your statements will not only address the feedback provided but also elevate the overall impact and coherence of your essay. Your dedication to learning English is evident, and refining your expression through structured, formal writing will further showcase your abilities and progress.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Narrative

In my opinion, I agree that any nation should be allowed to freely sell goods although this could contain some disadvantages. \n On the one hand, permitting unlimited commerce could bring certain drawbacks. Since governments do not establish a trade barrier, several foreign companies could export their goods without difficulty. As a result, domestic enterprises would have less opportunities to develop successfully since they could not compete with overseas brands that both have previous experience as well as financial support from mother companies behind. For example, the open car market in the UK has globally attracted various automobile exporters from other nations, causing a noticeable decline in the number of cars sold by domestic manufacturers. In addition, criminals could take advantage of the free trade policy to commit smuggling, causing viable threats to the public. \n On the other hand, governments should allow unrestricted transactions to improve the life of people. By permitting trading ability, goods would not only increase in quantity but also widely vary in model. Thus, customers would gain access to different buying options, fulfilling the unique demand of each individual. Furthermore, multiple companies would potentially lose their dominance as more imported goods are approved. Consequently, they would be forced to enhance the goods quality or otherwise reduce the price to contend for revenue, which directly benefits people purchasing items. For instance, the average cost of motorcycles in Laos has declined significantly after the government granted foreign manufacturers the selling permission, helping numeral people. \n In conclusion, I believe that any nation should be able to sell goods to others without limitation from governments despite the following disadvantages.","The writer tried to exaggerate his restatement and opinion paragraph which led to a less than accurate retelling of the orginal prompt.

The discussion topic is based on an opinion, not a controversy. This is a single opinion agree or disagree consideration. It is not an agree or disagree + advantage v. disadvantage debate. These 2 errors will ensure a failing overall score due to the confusing discussion format. \n The approach should have been based upon <em>""I agree with the previous statement based on the advantages of such a practice.""</em> or something similar. That opinionpresentation is clear and considered non-prompt deviant because the single opinion explanation has an advantage discussion basis. Both paragraphs after will explain the validity or acceptability of the writer's opinion. That is the main focus of the task.","The essay addresses a vital issue: whether governments should restrict international trade. While the essay contains valuable points, it could be improved for clarity and focus, ensuring it directly responds to the original topic.

Firstly, the introduction should clearly state the response to the given topic without adding unnecessary complexity. The essay appears to misinterpret the task by treating the topic as a controversy rather than a straightforward agree or disagree opinion piece. For a stronger start, simply stating whether agreeing or disagreeing with unrestricted international trade, and briefly mentioning the reasons, would set a more accurate and focused tone for the essay.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and style, the essay is generally well-written but occasionally suffers from awkward phrasing and could benefit from tighter, more precise language. Simplifying complex sentences and ensuring that each sentence directly contributes to the argument or explanation can enhance readability and comprehensibility.

The essay's point of view is clear in that it supports unrestricted international trade. However, the presentation of this viewpoint becomes somewhat diluted by attempting to equally discuss both sides of the argument. While the acknowledgment of opposing views can strengthen an argument, the primary focus should remain on explaining and supporting the chosen stance with clear, specific examples and rational reasoning.

Concerning arguments, the essay does present reasons in favor of the stance, such as potential benefits to consumers and the impact on pricing and quality of goods. However, these arguments can be made more compelling with more detailed examples, and by more directly linking these examples back to the essay's main argument. Also, ensuring a stronger distinction between the argument for unrestricted trade and the acknowledgment of its disadvantages could enhance the essay's persuasive power.

In summary, the essay would benefit from a clearer focus on directly responding to the task with a stated opinion on unrestricted international trade, simplifying language for clarity, and further developing the arguments with specific examples and a more direct link to the thesis. By refining these areas, the essay could more effectively communicate its viewpoint and engage the reader.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Some argue that we need to consider other factors behind a criminal activity and apply a flexible punishment rather than a fixed law. In my opinion, while giving fixed punishment will be easier for the judges to decide the punishment, the custom-law is more humanistic and tend to more wish to apply in human life. \n On the one hand, the way to apply fixed punishment for crimes is likely to make sense. For each type of crimes has the guidebook about the detail that lawbreakers will get by doing a specific activity against the law. It also will make the work of judges easier than apply customized punishment. The judges are not required to consider another thing that may strengthen one position in one case of criminals. It seems to be more efficient when judges will only refer to the lawbook that the nation has. \n On the other hand, fixed punishments are likely to have some weaknesses. Without considering the motivation and the environment where the individual crime does the wrong thing, it will lose the sense of objectivity. Furthermore, customize the law that considering other reasons why a person doing crime will make the law more humanistic and human-centered. When the judges refer to the lawbook and considering other factors behind the motive, it will make punishment fairer rather refer to the lawbook only. The benefit is not only for the crime person but also the judge because the judge will feel calmer after considering many things before deciding one case of criminals. \n In conclusion, applying a fixed law obviously will be easier for judges to decide a punishment, yet it will lose the sense of objectivity. It is better to apply a flexible law as it tends to be more humanistic and will be fairer for both the judges and the crimes. \n ---","Dear student, there is an improvement to your paraphrasing, but you still made a mistake in representing the discussion instruction.

This is a good choice of topic and relevant to the prompt. However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance your essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It's crucial to clearly present the assignment or discussion instruction within your essay. Your introduction should outline what the essay will cover, including an overview of the differing viewpoints and your own opinion. A more effective introduction might include a sentence like, ""This essay will consider both perspectives on punishment before presenting my viewpoint on why a more flexible approach is preferable.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay contains some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that can confuse readers. For example, ""the kind of law that apply to the crime person"" could be better expressed as ""the type of law that should be applied to individuals who commit crimes"". Paying attention to subject-verb agreement and sentence structure can make your arguments more coherent. Also, replacing vague terms like ""crime person"" with specific terms like ""individuals who commit crimes"" or ""offenders"" can enhance clarity.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view becomes evident towards the conclusion, where you clearly prefer flexible laws over fixed punishments. It would be beneficial to state your opinion earlier and more distinctly, then reaffirm it after discussing both sides. This approach helps readers follow your thought process throughout the essay.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While you outline reasons for and against fixed punishments, the arguments could be more detailed and supported by examples or evidence. For instance, when discussing the potential drawbacks of fixed punishments, illustrating with a hypothetical scenario or citing a real-life example could strengthen your position. Similarly, explaining how flexible laws can lead to fairer outcomes with specific examples would make your argument more persuasive.

To improve, consider revisiting the instruction for the essay prompt and make sure your essay aligns with it, particularly by giving a balanced discussion followed by your own stance. Enhance your work by focusing on English comprehension to ensure you fully understand how to construct your discussion in response to essay prompts.

What can be done?,"In modern society, there is a rising tendency of youngsters committing crimes in large cities around the world. There are several reasons for this reality and it is of great importance to implement practical solutions to tackle this issue. \n This situation stems from various causes. One of the major factors leading to the degradation in the young's moral is the environment in which they live and grow up. If children are nurtured in an unwholesome neighborhood and expose to bad individuals, their mindset and characteristics can be severely affected, hence gradually shaping their behaviors in a negative way. Another root of young people becoming criminals is the relationship among family members as well as the care from their parents. In the hustle and bustle of major cities, many parents do not have much time for their offsprings due to the heavy workload and excessive working hour. Therefore, their children are not under their supervisor and can be enticed to develop criminal actions. \n Carrying out solutions to improve the situation is an urgent task. An effective method to be applied is raising children's awareness through education. It is recommendable to have lessons about social issues and adjust the young's behaviors, thus providing them with adequate knowledge to realize what are detrimental and illegal to do as well as preventing themselves from becoming wrongdoers. In addition, it is necessary for parents to arrange their work and spend more time with their children. Since parents are the closest people to their offsprings, having time listening to their thought and giving advice to them is a practical way to protect them from committing crimes. \n In conclusion, the reality of young people increasingly becoming criminals can be explained by some factors. However, as long as the causes are identified, the society and their family need to take steps to alleviate this situation.","The paraphrasing attempt of the writer is definitely successful. It stayed focused on the topic without adding or removing information and shows that the vocabulary knowledge is intermediate enough to warrant a good LR score. However, the task accuracy was limited in consideration since there were no clear responses to the 2 questions posed. The summary response is really an important score boost in that section. \n I do not understand why the writer felt the need to use 2 topic sentences at the start of the first reasoning paragraph. Redundancies lower the scores because the writer is deemed to be using sentence fillers to meet the word requirement. The paragraph is well explained and will benefit from the cohesive reasoning presentation. \n Word usage in the essay is relatively acceptable as it does not confuse the reader. That is not to say the sentences are perfect though. Far from it, but the writer manages to write coherent sentences, which is the point of the explanatory paragraphs. \n The conclusion summary is close enough to a good reverse paraphrase. It would have helped if the causes and solutions were summarized in the paragraph as well. Not to worry though. Even though it is 3 words short of the minimum 40 word requirement for the paragraph, it still works.","This essay responds well to the topic, focusing on the reasons why young people in big cities may commit crimes and offering potential solutions. The attempt to paraphrase the prompt and consistently stay on topic reflects a solid understanding and command of vocabulary, indicating a good level of language proficiency. However, clarity in addressing specific questions within the topic could be improved to enhance the essay's directness and effectiveness.

One area for improvement is the organization of ideas. The introduction could be streamlined for clarity. Avoid using multiple topic sentences that convey similar ideas, as this can come across as redundancy rather than reinforcement of the point. Ensuring each paragraph begins with a clear, unique topic sentence will enhance the coherence and strength of the arguments presented.

The essay does well in forming coherent sentences, which significantly contributes to the overall readability and comprehension of the essay. Despite this, some grammatical, spelling, and stylistic issues were noted that, when addressed, could elevate the quality of writing. Paying closer attention to the choice of words and sentence structure will help in refining the essay’s overall presentation and effectiveness.

The conclusion succinctly wraps up the essay, but incorporating a brief summary of both the causes and solutions discussed could offer a more comprehensive closing. Although it narrowly meets the word count requirements, aiming for a slightly longer conclusion would ensure all essential elements are thoroughly covered.

In the essay, the point of view is clear, presenting a logical flow from identifying the problem to suggesting solutions. However, offering more descriptive arguments and concrete examples to support the claims will strengthen the position laid out. Furthermore, ensuring that each proposed solution directly addresses the causes mentioned would make the argument more compelling.

To improve, focus on refining the structure of your essay by clearly distinguishing your main points, enhancing the specificity of your arguments with examples, and diligently proofreading to resolve any linguistic errors.

Yet we can be less wasteful in the way we use these things by reusing, reducing, recycling and also through authorities' policies. \n Governments could certainly take more effort to curb deforestation by introducing a series of rules and laws to govern it. This might force companies and residents to lessen the usage of trees. For example, they could impose green taxes on companies where they consume a large amount of wood in their production. In addition, cutting must be replaced by planting young trees to replace the older ones that were cut. In this way, enterprises would be encouraged to use materials which are more environmentally sustainable. \n Individuals should also take responsibility for their impact. We can reuse bags instead of throwing the bag away after using only once and take the bag with us on our next shopping trip. Besides, when it really has enough life, we can bring the bag to a recycling center as paper is so easy to recycle. Last but not least, reducing might be also an effective action. For instance, reading online news articles instead of newspaper, as the advantage of technology, and using cloth napkins instead of paper ones. \n In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in eliminating logging trees.

This demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and addresses the question well.

However, there are areas where improvements can be made to enhance the structure, clarity, and overall effectiveness of the essay. First, it is crucial to meet the essay structure requirements, such as having a minimum of three sentences per paragraph. This helps in building well-structured arguments and improves the readability of the essay. Some paragraphs may benefit from further development or division to avoid run-on sentences, which occur when two or more independent clauses are incorrectly joined without appropriate punctuation or conjunction. Remember, each sentence should focus on a single idea to maintain clarity.

Regarding stylistic choices, reducing the repetition of key phrases from the prompt or question not only avoids redundancy but also showcases your vocabulary range. Instead of repeating phrases like ""all over the world,"" variations such as ""worldwide"" can enhance the lexical resourcefulness of the essay. This demonstrates your ability to use a wide range of vocabulary to express ideas precisely.

There are minor errors in spelling and grammar, as well as opportunities to refine the essay’s styling for better clarity and impact. For example, the expression ""connived at the felling of trees"" might be clearer as ""overlooked the cutting down of trees."" Choosing more direct and simple language can help make your arguments more accessible and persuasive to the reader.

The essay does well in presenting a clear point of view, arguing that both governments and individuals have roles to play in addressing deforestation. To strengthen this further, it would be beneficial to include more specific examples and detailed arguments supporting the proposed solutions. For instance, when discussing the recycling of bags, a more in-depth explanation of how this action contributes to reducing tree consumption could be illustrated. This not only supports your viewpoint but also engages the reader with a more compelling argument.

Lastly, ensuring that each paragraph introduces and concludes its main idea can help in making your essay more cohesive and coherent. The conclusion ties the essay together well, reiterating the necessity for both governmental and individual action, which is good. However, elaborating on how these actions interlink and contribute to the bigger picture of solving environmental issues might provide a stronger closing statement.

In summary, focusing on improving sentence structure, avoiding run-on sentences, expanding vocabulary, and providing more detailed examples will greatly enhance the quality of the essay. Keep up the good work on addressing the topic and presenting clear viewpoints; with some adjustments for clarity and structure, your essay can become an even more effective piece of writing.",3,3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

Ensure that you fully understand the essay prompt and address it directly throughout your piece. If the prompt specifically asks for the advantages and disadvantages, make sure to address both sides evenly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While your essay has a clear structure, paying closer attention to the choice of words and sentence construction will help in making your argument more robust. For instance, using the word “harsh” instead of “hard” to describe conditions can offer a more accurate description. Simplify your expressions for clarity and ease of understanding. Instead of using phrases like “so as to”, “in order to”, or “thanks to the proliferation of”, direct expressions like “to”, or simply explaining the cause and effect can make your essay more straightforward and easier to follow.

3. **Point of View**: Your position in favor of continuing vigorous sports is evident. However, ensuring that each paragraph consistently supports this view without deviation will strengthen your argument. Use each paragraph to introduce a new point that backs up your stance clearly and directly.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: Your arguments regarding the utility of vigorous sports in survival and the role of protective equipment in reducing risks are compelling. However, these arguments can be made stronger with more detailed examples and by explicitly connecting these examples back to your main point. Ensure each argument is fully explored with clear, descriptive language that illustrates your point vividly. Incorporating more descriptive adjectives and avoiding vague terms can enhance the impact of your arguments. For example, when discussing protective equipment, you could specify how modern technology has made participation in sports like skydiving and skiing safer.

Avoid over-discussing by sticking to the required number of points or paragraphs. This will help maintain clarity and focus throughout your essay.

3. **Sentence Structure:** Aim for a balance in sentence types. Currently, the essay contains many long, complex sentences that may confuse the reader or obscure your points. Shorter, clearer sentences, mixed with a few carefully constructed longer ones, can make your essay more accessible and easier to understand. Each sentence should convey a single idea or piece of information, contributing directly to your argument.

4. **Clarity in the Conclusion:** The role of telecommunications in addressing food waste, as mentioned in your conclusion, seems unclear and disconnected from the rest of your essay. Ensure that your conclusion succinctly summarizes your main points and suggests clear, relevant solutions. Avoid introducing new information or ideas in the conclusion that are not discussed in the body of the essay.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are several instances of missing spaces after commas and missing articles before nouns (e.g., ""the government""). Additionally, some words are misspelled or incorrectly used. Proofreading for such errors can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.

6. **Support for Arguments:** While you have outlined reasons for food wastage and proposed solutions, these could be further strengthened by adding specific examples or statistics. Demonstrating how these solutions have worked elsewhere or citing research can make your argument more persuasive.

By addressing these areas, your essay will be more focused, coherent, and effective in communicating your viewpoint. Remember, the clarity of your argument and adherence to the essay structure are key to a successful essay.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative
4693,https://essayforum.com/writing/question-advantage-disadvantage-working-home-91743/,dev,Question about the advantage and disadvantage of working from home.,"Nowadays, because of the adverse consequences of the Covid-19 pandemics, telecommuting becomes more popular than ever before. In my opinion, there are several benefits but also potential drawbacks. In this essay, I will weigh up both the upside and downside of working at home. \n As people work at their homes, there are some pros that can be mentioned. First of all, working at home means people could eliminate their commute, which allows maximum use of time. Furthermore, people need to manage time responsibly and rationally to fulfil the work requirement, therefore, it will stimulate autonomy and independence in jobs. There is also a chance for people telecommuting that they can have more time to gather family. \n On the other hand, the house is where people find comfort and satisfaction. With the freedom to move around and take breaks whenever the mood arises so that it is difficult to focus on job tasks being done. Opposed to that, it is stress and pressure that the workplace's atmosphere brings, which will motivate people to work harder and productive. People who telecommute are more likely to isolate themselves due to the majority of time spent working independently. Beyond, staying at home for a long time leading to the electrical and water time usage significantly rise results in an increase in the cost of living. \n In summary, although working at home can save time and be more convenient, it also has the existing limitations. Thus, people need to take measures to mitigate these negative aspects.","<quotation>because of the adverse consequences of the Covid-19 pandemics</quotation> \n Do not make reference to current events in your restatement. The original topic is not connected to this presentation so this topic inclusion will lower the task score. The prompt restatement must be brief and refer only to a rewording of the original topic, without added information coming from the writer. \n <quotation>In my opinion</quotation> \n Your opinion is not deemed necessary in this discussion. In fact, you are not even prodded to provide it by the discussion guideline. This essay is a general comparison rather than single opinion essay. You misunderstoodthe writing instruction for this prompt. \n The first reasoning paragraph is good but, could use a better discussion presentation. More supporting information would help bring a solid advantage discussion to the front. \n The second reasoning statement is badly explained. There are too many topics presented in the paragraph, none of which are properly developed to create a convincing like of thought. The coherence and cohesiveness is faulty and will pull down the overall score. The conclusion is an acceptable presentation.","The essay provides a balanced view on the topic of telecommuting, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance the clarity, relevance, and coherence of the discussion.

1. **Topic Relevance**: The introduction of the essay links the increase in telecommuting to the Covid-19 pandemic. While current events can indeed impact trends in telecommuting, it is essential to focus directly on the topic provided without adding external contexts unless specifically requested. Stick closely to the prompt and avoid incorporating additional information that might divert attention from the main discussion.

2. **Presentation of Opinion**: The instruction for the essay did not require a personal opinion but rather a balanced discussion of telecommuting's pros and cons. The phrase ""In my opinion"" suggests a personal viewpoint which may not be appropriate for this type of essay. It's essential to carefully read the instructions and understand whether a personal opinion is asked for or if a neutral, balanced discussion is preferred.

3. **Development of Arguments**: The first paragraph discussing the benefits of telecommuting is on the right track but lacks depth. To strengthen your essay, consider adding more detailed examples or statistics to support your points. This approach will make your arguments more convincing and solid.

4. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph addressing the drawbacks of telecommuting tries to cover too much ground without fully developing each point. This results in a lack of clear, convincing lines of thought, making the essay difficult to follow. To improve, focus on a few key points and discuss them in depth instead of briefly mentioning several different drawbacks. This focused approach will help maintain clarity and coherence throughout the essay.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While there are no significant errors, paying attention to sentence structure and punctuation will improve readability. Avoid long, complex sentences that may confuse the reader and instead use clear, concise language.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion summarizes the essay's main points well. However, it could be strengthened by briefly suggesting solutions or ways to balance the pros and cons of telecommuting, making the conclusion not only reflective but also forward-thinking.

To sum up, focusing on directly addressing the topic, developing your points more fully, ensuring clarity and coherence, and adhering to the essay instructions will significantly improve your writing. Keep these points in mind for your next essay, and you will see progress in your ability to clearly and effectively communicate your ideas.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4694,https://essayforum.com/writing/waste-time-read-news-newspapers-watch-86219/,dev,Is it a waste of time to read news in newspapers and watch television news programs?,"Collecting news has long become an indispensable part of many people's lives, yet some argue that there is no point in checking the newspapers or watching television for news since it has little relevance to daily life. Personally, I do not concur with this view since I believe that news is of paramount importance to people's lives as it equips them with the information needed for decision-making and offers them profound insights into their own life and the world around them. \n The first and foremost rationale for the vital role of news is that it informs people with the current state of affairs that can assist them to make wise decisions in their life. As an instance, news of the economic climate gives businessmen the basis to develop suitable strategies for their enterprises. A rise in oil prices, to be specific, can result in the escalating prices of myriad other materials and products, thereby raising the cost of production in plants. Another compelling example is the dissemination of health-related information. During the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, people need to rely on the news in the newspaper and on TV to keep themselves updated with the numbers of cases, preventative measurements as well as lockdown policies from the government so that they can come up with the best plans to protect themselves and their families. \n The second purpose that news can serve is to give people a better understanding of the collective world and their individual self. The news programs which feature war or hunger in Third world countries provide people in well-off states with a comprehensive view of what is actually happening on Earth, besides the luxuries of life they enjoy. Some people may propose an opposition that knowledge on those topics has little to no use in their life. However, I believe that these types of news can teach people to be grateful for what they have and thus motivate them to lead a more worthwhile life. Many people will also be encouraged to join hands in alleviating the suffering of their fellow human beings in less-developed or war-torn countries. Together, they can make the world a better place to live for everyone.","You do klnow that you only have 40 minutes to write this essay right? You cannot write these many words within 40 minutes. Please use a timer when you practice, that way you will know if you are running overtime and you will be able to identify why. The standard word length is 275-290 words, focused on clarity and quality. The examiner doesn't care about how many English words and sentences you know. What he wants to know is how well you can express yourself, quickly and clearly, within the 5 sentence limitation of every paragraph. Keep it short, score better. \n Focus on developing individual discussion ideas. You are over discussing by presenting several reasons in one paragraph. None of which are properly explained nor supported with explanations and reasons. So the examiner will definitely call your writing under developed, confusing, and lacking in proper representation of ideas. You will not score well in the C&C section. \n Let us not forget, the examiner will also immediately see that you failed to respond to the task requirement. The requirement is a response to the question: to what extent do you agree or disagree? A simple ""I do not concur"" does not respond to the question that requires a measured response. You need to represent the gravity of your dis/agreement with the statement with an emotional response. You may review the other essays here on a similar topic and using a similar instruction to learn how to better approach this type of essay discussion. \n These are the two reasons that your essay will be held back from achieving a decent band score.

It is the quality of the essay presentation, the adherence to the scoring rubic that will help you pass the test.","The essay demonstrates a clear engagement with the topic, asserting the importance of news in people's lives for making informed decisions and gaining a broader perspective of the world. However, there are several ways in which its effectiveness could be improved to better meet exam requirements and enhance clarity and impact.

Firstly, it's crucial to manage the length and structure of the essay within the typical constraints of an English proficiency test. While comprehensive discussion is valuable, a more concise approach that adheres to word limits (ideally 275-290 words) and paragraph structure is essential. Aim for five sentences per paragraph as a guideline to ensure each idea is clearly stated and elaborated upon without becoming overly verbose. This practice will help in expressing ideas quickly and clearly, which is a key assessment criterion.

In terms of content development, the essay tends to introduce multiple reasons in one paragraph without fully exploring or supporting these points. For an improved score in the coherence and cohesion section of the assessment, focus on developing one main idea per paragraph. This approach allows for deeper exploration and better-supported arguments, creating a more developed and compelling narrative. Remember, clarity and depth of discussion are more valued than the breadth of topics covered.

Additionally, the essay could better address the task requirement by explicitly stating the extent of agreement or disagreement with the given statement. Rather than a simple statement of position, consider articulating the strength of your agreement or disagreement, potentially incorporating an emotional or personal response to create a more nuanced and persuasive argument. This will directly respond to the prompt's demand for a measured response and demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic.

Finally, remember that the quality of the argument and adherence to essay structure are more important than the length of the essay. A well-organized, focused, and insightful essay that meets the task's requirements is the goal. In summary, aim for concise and cohesive argument development, clear expression of your position regarding the task statement, and adherence to structure guidelines to improve both the impact and the score potential of future essays.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4695,https://essayforum.com/writing/better-students-attending-online-classes-86472/,dev,What's better for students; to attending online classes or studying at traditional schools?,"In the future, students may have the choice of studying at the home by useful technology such as computers or television or of studying at traditional schools. Which would you prefer? Use reasons and specific details to explain your choice? \n Whether it would be better for students to attend online classes from their homes or whether they should continue going to traditional schools, given that they have the choice to pick, it is a debatable issue that has sparked a great deal of controversy. Nobody can deny that computer technology has offered a range of advantages in education. However, I am an avid adherent of traditional education for the following reasons. \n To begin with, going to school provides a wide range of benefits to a student. First and foremost, school has always been described as the micrography of society. School is the first means of socialization, as a child has to face a new environment that might trigger difficulties and of course, it might contribute to the pupil's maturity. For instance, students have to meet other peers every day. They have to find ways in order to establish friendly relationships and get along with people that they might not like. Therefore, through this process, children develop their temperament and this is a process that cannot be accomplished with the convenience of home and in front of a screen. \n Furthermore, it seems to me that the process of learning is more efficient through attending traditional schools than watching online lectures. It is commonly accepted that the role of the teacher is vital for the transmission of knowledge. To be precise, it has been proven that the learning process is mostly an emotional procedure. As a result, the connection between the students and the teacher affects the educational outcomes significantly. This is another critical factor that cannot be provided by online schooling. \n To sum up, although online learning may offer conveniences that seem attractive, I firmly believe that the future impact of that will be detrimental to students' formation.","I always tell my students to never write more than 1 essay per day for their home exercise. The reason behind the one essay task per day is because each and every essay that you write will contain several errors that need to be corrected. There may even be times when the student repeats the same error over several successive tasks. Learning time is wasted that way. Rather than correcting the mistakes of the student and leading them towards the correct writing path, the student ends up frustrated and angry because the essays that he wrote successively just do not meet the passing mark. In your case, you successively wrote essays and had several mistakes in each one. Rather than having a learning lesson from each mistake, you will be overwhelmed by your mistakes and find it difficult to overcome the errors you made. So from this point on, I want you to write only 1 essay task per day. Wait for the review, learn from the lessons you will be given, and apply it to your succeeding essays. Take is one essay at a time if you really want to learn how to write these essays properly. \n Your first sentence in the paraphrase section is just one confusing run on sentence. You actually managed to convey a mixed message statement instead of simply putting the original topic across to the examiner. Always go for clarity. So one idea per sentence. That way you can properly structure the sentence for clarity and comprehension value. Hence: \n <em>It is believed that the future of education lies in modern learning gadgets. Students will soon be using laptops, smart screens, for home lessons. This is a far cry from the conventional academic learning style at conventional teaching institutions. Personally, I would prefer to attend regular classes at standard academies. Mostly because there are more learning benefits to attending formal lessons. These formal lessons also provide more of a well rounded educational experience. Let me explain further below.</em> \n Now, while your response will be considered and scored by the examiner, I would like to point something out to you with regards to the information requirement for this essay. Use reasons and specific details for your choice. The examiner would like to be assured that you are informed of the current educational trends as it applies to students. Therefore, you should be discussing this essay from the current school from home situation of the worldwide student population. All the students are benefiting from studying at home. You should show that you are also abreast of the current events, specifically, about how Covic-19 has changed the educational landscape. \n Never use words that connote uncertainty in your statements. Either you believe that traditional schooling will contribute to a student's maturity or you don't. There is no maybe in the discussion. Show strong support for the point of view that you have chose. If you are uncertain about a particular reason, do not include it in the discussion as it will weaken your essay and show indecision on your part. That will affect your TA score. \n The concluding paraphrase is incomplete. You need to restate the original discussion points again, this time with your reasons, and opinion so that you can properly summarize the essay presentation. I know, it is repetitive. However, the examiner needs to see that you are not just writing using memorized words and phrases. The reverse summary allows you to do exactly that by giving you a chance to prove that you really understood the original prompt and you truly believe your discussion reasons.","Your essay on whether students should prefer online learning or traditional schooling presents a thoughtful position. However, there are areas for improvement to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay addresses the question by arguing in favor of traditional schooling over online education. This shows you understood the prompt but remember to directly address all parts of the question. Bringing in current contexts, like changes in education due to COVID-19, could enhance the relevance of your argument.

2. **Clarity and Structure:** Your introduction was somewhat confusing due to the lengthy sentence that tried to encapsulate too many ideas at once. Aim for simplicity and clarity. Breaking down complex thoughts into shorter sentences can help. For example, clearly stating your preference and briefly mentioning your reasons can make your introduction more effective.

3. **Specific Details and Arguments:** You provided reasons supporting traditional education, such as socialization and the teacher-student relationship, which are strong points. However, make sure to support your arguments with more specific details or examples, possibly linking back to how these factors are relevant today. Avoid statements that show uncertainty; your stance should be clear and confidently stated.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** While your essay is generally well-written, pay attention to minor errors and the consistency of your argumentative style. Also, remember that the essay's voice should be formal and avoid colloquial expressions.

5. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion summarizes your stance but misses the opportunity to restate your reasoning and reinforce your position effectively. A strong conclusion not only restates the main points but also leaves the reader with something to think about, connecting back to the question.

6. **General Recommendations:** To improve, consider writing one essay per day and carefully reviewing feedback before moving on to the next task. This methodical approach allows you to learn from each essay and continuously improve. 

Improving in these areas could make your essay clearer, more persuasive, and more aligned with the expectations of English proficiency tests.

While the attempt to cover both causes and solutions is commendable, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

First, focusing on response to the topic, the essay partially meets the requirements by attempting to discuss reasons and solutions. However, it lacks a clear thesis statement, which is essential for guiding the reader through the essay’s purpose and structure. It is recommended to start with a stronger introduction that clearly states the main argument and what the essay will discuss.

Concerning spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are multiple errors present that impact readability and coherence. For example, the phrase ""remarked rising all"" uses ""remarked"" incorrectly. When selecting words, it's crucial to ensure they fit the context both in meaning and usage. To improve, practice constructing simple sentences and focus on using vocabulary correctly. Reading English texts and consulting a dictionary can aid in understanding word usage and sentence structure.

The essay also encounters issues with clarity regarding the author's point of view and argumentation. Although an attempt is made to present causes and solutions, these are somewhat general and lack specific examples or explanations to support the arguments fully. For stronger arguments, include detailed examples and more in-depth explanations of why these issues occur and how the suggested solutions could be effective.

To enhance coherence and cohesion, organize the essay into clear paragraphs, each addressing a particular aspect of the issue. Begin with an introduction that outlines the essay, followed by separate paragraphs for reasons, solutions, and a concluding summary that reinforces the main point.

In summary, while the essay takes on an important topic, focusing on clearer thesis statement, precise vocabulary use, and structured argumentation will significantly improve the quality of writing. Practicing writing simple, clear sentences and gradually building up to more complex structures can help overcome many of the identified issues.

There are some reasons leading to this problem, and fortunately there are also appropriate measures to fix the situation. \n To start with, difference between generations is the primary cause of the gap deviding families. For example, parents easily get confused, and struggle to understand their children's thoughts. Spontaneously, children also feel like their parents are incomprehensible, and keep breaking their privacy and freedom. This is how generation gap looks like, and leaving it unsolved can result in various kinds of nagative knock-on effects. Secondly, the lack of communitcation is one of the most serious culprits which is need to be fixed. It is obvious that every organization existing without sharing and communicating will be collapsed including families. Therefore, the shotage of talking and listening between members in a house can help the gap grow bigger and bigger from day to day. \n From my perspective, the solutions should come from both sides, or all family members together. On one hand, parents should be friends with their children in order to listen what are their problems and struggles. This is an ideal method to narrow the generation gap, and aslo to get to understand their children more deeply. On the other hand, children should try to put themselves in their parents' shoes so as to recognize difficulties and hardship parents are facing.

The effort to address both causes and solutions reflects an understanding of the topic. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and correctness.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay adequately addresses the topic by identifying issues and proposing solutions. However, the introduction could more directly state the specific aspects of the family gap you will discuss. Avoid making broad claims not directly supported or elaborated upon in your essay, such as ""Regardless of many efforts have been made,"" to keep the focus on your central argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are a few errors that need attention. For instance, ""communication"" is misspelled as ""communitcation"", and there's an instance of starting a sentence with ""And"", which should be avoided in formal writing. Remember to proofread to correct these errors, ensuring your essay's professionalism and readability are maintained.

3. **The Essay Author’s Point of View**: Your viewpoint is clear — you believe that both parents and children should work together to bridge the generational gap. This is a strong stance; however, presenting it with examples or more detailed explanation could further strengthen it. It's beneficial to elaborate on how mutual understanding can be achieved in practical steps.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: You provide arguments that generational differences and lack of communication contribute to the family gap, which are relevant. Nevertheless, these arguments could be enriched by including specific examples or citing research/studies to make them more compelling. Also, when proposing solutions, detailing how families can implement these measures (e.g., scheduled family meetings, counseling) would provide a clearer action plan.

To improve your essay:
- Ensure your introduction aligns closely with the points you plan to discuss, avoiding any misleading statements.
- Correct spelling and grammar errors, and adhere to formal academic writing conventions, including how you start sentences.
- Deepen your arguments with examples or evidence, making your viewpoint and proposed solutions more persuasive and practical.

The score that I assume you could get is based upon the improperly represented paraphrased statement. While the context of your interpretation is sound, you used the word ""And"" to start a sentence. Since ""And"" is used as a term to join a group of related words in a sentence, it cannot be used to start a new sentence. The reason behind that is that there are no other words to join at the start of a sentence, therefore the word should not be used in that position in any paragraph. It can only be used in the middle of a sentence. The rest of the essay delivers simple explanations and English sentences that prove your ability to understand and discuss the prompt requirements.

The position that happiness isn't solely tied to material wealth but also includes aspects like family, health, and societal relationships, is presented clearly. This foundational understanding demonstrates a good grasp of the essay topic.

However, there are several areas where this essay could be strengthened:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay adequately responds to the topic by discussing the nature of happiness and its various sources. To improve, consider offering a more structured argument. Introduce your main idea in the opening paragraph, then use subsequent paragraphs to explore each factor contributing to happiness, supported by examples or more in-depth explanations.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are noticeable issues with grammar and sentence structure throughout the essay that hinder clarity. For example, using ""And"" to start a sentence is not recommended in formal writing because it serves as a connecting word within sentences rather than at the beginning. Also, pay attention to subject-verb agreement (""Every people have had"" should be ""Every person has""). Enhancing sentence development will not only improve grammatical accuracy but also the overall flow of the essay. Consider reviewing basic grammar rules and practicing sentence construction for a stronger presentation.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** Your perspective on happiness being influenced by various factors beyond material wealth is clear. However, sharper, more concise sentences could enhance the expression of this viewpoint. Aim for directness in your language to avoid confusion.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support:** While the essay mentions several factors that contribute to happiness, these points often lack detailed support or examples. For instance, when mentioning the societal pressure in Korea regarding physical appearance, delve deeper into how this impacts individuals’ perceptions of happiness.  Moreover, bringing up the value of gratitude, family, and social relationships is positive, but providing specific scenarios or evidence would make these arguments more compelling and relatable.

To make your essay more dynamic and engaging, consider introducing a personal anecdote or citing a study that aligns with your points. This strategy not only bolsters your argument but also makes your writing more appealing to readers.

4699,https://essayforum.com/writing/sports-social-activities-great-influence-study-79191/,dev,Sports and social activities great influence on study should be noted and supported by goverment,"There have appeared endless discussions over educational contents at college. Some educators suggest that it is of great necessity for colleges to place activities outside the classroom and understanding derived from studying in equal status. Personally, I completely approve of this suggestion. \n First of all, what takes my priority is study efficiency. It is widely known that taking part in social activities means that students are able to first-hand expose to numerous situations requiring academic knowledge to resolve. This brings them golden opportunities to practice and apply what they have acquired at schools to real life. Students are certain to build a robust background which is composed of both empirical experience and theories. As a result, they will make much progress in their academic performance. More notably, learners can temporarily set their study aside while joining extracurricular activities. They are likely to release stress and refresh themselves. Because of this, it is possible for them to go back to study with higher productivity. This leads to significant advancement in their study effectiveness. With no doubt, the best way for schools to enhance quality in education is to ponder activities outside the class as important as classes and libraries. \n In the second place, skills development is what cannot be left out when considering the essence. It is well noted that due to following sports and social activities, students are engaged in more work in lieu of only fully concentrating on textbooks and assignments. Thus, becoming busier is inevitable for them. Only by more effectively scheduling timetable, are students capable of balancing numerous duties. To this end, their time management skill will be definitely practiced and ameliorated. More importantly, participating in extracurricular activities require learners to communicate and work with others. These new friends are different from each other in many aspects such as personality, background and age. Accordingly, learners have to learn how to communicate in harmony with them. If this occurs, then there is likelihood for learners to considerably promote communications skill. Without doubt, it is advisable for colleges to equip their students with various valuable skills. \n In a word, the increase in study efficiency and improvement in personal skills of students are convincing reasons for my approval of the suggestion. It is highly recommended that educators should take my writing into great consideration to make appropriate decisions on educational contents at colleges and universities.","Do, I understand that you are most likely self studying for the IELTS test and as such, you are not getting proper instructions regarding the best ways to develop, write, and present your essay. You also are not cognizant of the time constraint when writing these essays. Summed up, you are not conscious of the fact that the essay that you turned is impossible to write in an actual test setting. \n While there is no maximum word count on the essay, you need to be conscious of the time allotted for the essay task. You only have 40 minutes with which to accomplish the following in the testing center: \n 1. Read and understand the prompt \n 2. Outline your discussion \n 3. Develop a draft essay \n 4. Review the content \n 5. Correct the content \n 6. Proofread the essay \n 7. Correct all grammar, punctuation, and sentence development mistakes. \n The mere outlining of the discussion and development of the draft essay could take as much as 20 minutes already on your part. That means you only have 20 minutes left to finish the rest of the checklist activities before turning in the essay. Due to the number of movements required in the finalization of the essay content, it is always best that you write between 250-300 words only. Bear in mind that you are not being scored on your vocabulary but rather, on our ability to properly use the English language in a manner that makes sure you are understood by the reader. Keep it simple and focus on being understood rather than trying to use ""big"" words like ""empirical"" and ""ameliorated"" out of context. \n Now, while there is no upper word limit on the essay, there is a paragraph and sentence maximum which assures that you will not go over the top with your word presentations. Based on the 3-5 sentence limitation on the required 5 paragraphs for the Task 2 essay, you are always assured that you will be writing between 250-300 words. Manageable enough to edit in terms of the provided time limit. Stick to these limitations in order to maximize your scoring potential. You need to make yourself understood within a controlled number of sentences, without relying on run on sentences that separate different discussions using a comma. You will definitely lose points for that. \n Since this is an opinion essay, you should use the first person pronoun in order to strengthen your statements. The fact that you support these reasons adds to the idea that you understand what the prompt is about and how to discuss it properly. By the way, this is not an ""emotional"" opinion essay so there is no need to use the term ""strongly"". That is better used in the ""emotional"" opinion presentation. In connection with this, please do not use connecting words such as ""because"" to start a sentence because there is no thought process to connect to it. See the previous sentence that I wrote for an example as to the proper use of the word ""because"" in a sentence. \n Your concluding statement is incorrect. You are not supposed to insist upon your opinion at the end of this essay. Also, academic experts in the field will not be reading your essay. Therefore, your opinion is not going to reach their ears or eyes. Use the concluding paragraph for what is originally meant for. That is, the restatement of the prompt, the discussion points you presented within 3 body paragraphs, then a repeat of your opinion. That is all that is required. \n There are considerable mistakes in this essay that are reflected by my above observations. As such, I will not do an in-depth, detailed review of every mistake that you made here. I don't want you to lose confidence. I want you to think positive and believe that your next essay can be better and should be better if you apply the advice you received here. I look forward to assessing your next essay.","Your essay shows dedication and a strong understanding of the importance of extracurricular activities alongside academic work in colleges. However, there are several areas in which your essay could be improved to adhere more closely to English proficiency test standards, specifically with regard to effectiveness in conveying your ideas within a tighter framework. Let’s delve into these aspects.

1. **Essay Response to the Topic**: Your essay aligns well with the topic, demonstrating a clear stance on the importance of balancing academic studies with extracurricular activities in college education. You’ve successfully communicated your viewpoint, utilizing examples to support your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, your essay is well-written, but there are minor errors and some word choices that could be optimized. Remember, clarity and simplicity are paramount; using overly complex vocabulary (""empirical"", ""ameliorated"") can sometimes cloud your message rather than clarify it. Consider choosing words that accurately convey your meaning without necessitating frequent dictionary consultations for your readers. Additionally, be mindful of sentence structure to avoid run-on sentences, ensuring clarity and coherence throughout your essay.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Your point of view is clear and consistently maintained throughout the essay. Your firm stance on the topic and the reasoning behind your opinion are evident, which strengthens your argument. To enhance this further, consistently use the first person pronoun where appropriate to solidify the presentation of your opinion as your own.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author’s Position**: Your defense of the importance of integrating extracurricular activities with academic study is compelling, yet there could be a tighter organization. Aim for conciseness in your arguments to improve readability and impact. Each point you make is valuable; however, refining how you present these ideas could bolster their effectiveness. 

**Additional Feedback for Improvement**: 

- **Essay Length and Time Management**: Be aware of the time constraints typical of English proficiency tests. Writing an essay within these limits means being concise and efficient with your words. Aim for essays that are about 250-300 words, focusing on quality over quantity. This length allows you to express your ideas clearly and succinctly while having time to review and edit your work.

- **Concluding Statement**: Your conclusion should succinctly encapsulate your argument, summarizing the key points discussed rather than introducing new ideas or insisting upon your viewpoint. Remember, the conclusion serves to remind the reader of your stance and the evidence you provided, closing your argument effectively.

- **Usage of Connectives**: While connective words like “because” are instrumental in linking ideas, their placement within a sentence matters. They should not start sentences but rather join clauses within sentences to aid the flow of arguments.

By addressing these areas, your essays will not only adhere more closely to test requirements but will also be clearer and more engaging to read. You have a good understanding of the subject matter; refining how you present your arguments will enhance your writing significantly. Keep practicing, focusing on these areas, and your essays will undoubtedly improve.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative
4700,https://essayforum.com/writing/government-invest-money-science-education-79528/,dev,Government should invest more money in science education rather than other subjects,"It is said that government funding for education should give preference to science-based subjects over others, in an attempt to help boost a countries future development and progress. Despite of the advantages of other disciplines to national progress, personally I strongly believe that science is the primary contributor. \n On the one hand, it cannot be denied that the study of many other subjects of education can also attribute to a countries progress. For instance, the arts allow societies and individuals to express themselves creatively through mediums such as music, film and other art forms. It can help to improve the quality of people's lives and fill the lifetime with human well-being. \n On the other hand, I content that science should be allocated more financial resources by the authorities for several reasons. Firstly, science is the origin of development in all fields. For example, in the research of history, science is the main tool to gain a better understanding of humanity. Secondly, the scientific and technological development of each country reflects the position of the whole nation. There are a great deal of prosperous countries in the world that have great scientific advances. Furthermore, science makes an important contribution to the survival and improvement of human beings. As a result, almost products which everyone is consuming are outcome of the study of scientific researches. In the other aspect, people are trying to find out the best measure for environment protection through science. \n In conclusion, the authorities should give all disciplines financial support to help towards a countries overall development. It is better that science should be obtained more concerns.","Hoa, you opening paraphrase is not an accurate restatement of the original prompt. Your discussion instruction line is also inaccurate as you are being asked for an opinion regarding agreement or disagreement with the statement. You responded with a discussion regarding which should be given the most responsibility instead. An inaccurate prompt restatement that gets a less than passing score will ensure that the rest of your essay gets low scores as well due to your discussing a different topic from the one stated for discussion. Aside from that, you discussed 2 points of view in this essay when the required point of view discussion is clearly indicated as needing to come from only one point of view. This is not a comparison point of view discussion. It is a singular point of view essay. These problems with your prompt deviation are what will cause this essay to get a less than stellar score had this been an actual test.","The essay presents a discussion on whether government funding for education should prioritize science-based subjects to enhance a country's development. The author argues in favor of more funding for science, presenting multiple reasons for this preference. However, there are several areas for improvement and points to consider to strengthen the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay partially addresses the prompt by discussing the significance of funding science-based subjects. However, it diverges from the specific requirement of stating a clear opinion on whether science subjects should be prioritized over others for government funding. Instead of focusing on comparing science with other disciplines mainly in terms of funding allocation, it would be more effective to directly address the prompt by clearly stating whether science subjects should be prioritized and why.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies that need attention. The incorrect use of ""countries"" instead of ""countries'"" or ""a country's"" to indicate possession is repeated. Phrases like ""Despite of the advantages"" should be corrected to ""Despite the advantages."" Additionally, simplifying complex sentences and avoiding repetition could enhance readability and coherence.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay initially seems to argue for more funding for science but concludes by suggesting that all disciplines should receive financial support, with a slight preference for science. This mixed message might confuse readers. It's crucial to maintain a consistent stance throughout the essay to clearly convey the author's point of view.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position**: The author provides several arguments in favor of science, emphasizing its role in development, technological advancement, and solutions for environmental protection. However, these arguments could be further strengthened by providing more concrete examples, data, or studies to support the claims. Additionally, since the essay diverges into discussing the benefits of other subjects like the arts, it dilutes the focus from science-based subjects. A more focused discussion on why science specifically deserves more funding, in line with the essay's thesis, would be beneficial.

To improve the essay, the author should directly address the prompt, focusing clearly on the justification for prioritizing funding for science-based subjects. Paying attention to grammatical accuracy and maintaining a consistent stance will enhance the essay's effectiveness. Strengthening arguments with concrete examples or evidence will also support the author's position more convincingly.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

While some may suggest teaching only the literature of the country, the suggestion is groundless, and should not be implemented. \n Learning about other literature from other countries has considerable advantages. First, it offers opportunities for students to discover new cultures. The pupil would find it easy to learn a new language by comprehending other cultures, which is very necessary nowadays. Second, it's a chance to meet learners around the world or make more friends. That indicates they can broaden their knowledge of the beliefs, values, and consumptions of others that are considered to be the element that builds culture. \n Furthermore, if graduated children understand other traditions, they will have more employment opportunities. Thanks to globalization, they can work not only in their country's company but also in multinational companies. They would have decent jobs with high salaries which could improve their standard of living. In addition, once they have knowledge of the literature of other countries, they may be given opportunities to teach other people about their literature. These activities may help to improve this country's literature surface. \n To sum up, there are many advantages to teaching students about the literature of other countries, so students should be taught both country literature and other countries.","The first thing I noticed about this essay is that it does not follow the standard IELTS prompt for this topic which is: \n <em>It is more important for students to study history and literature than it is for them to study science and mathematics. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</em> \n So I am not sure how to approach the review for this discussion. It does not follow the original prompt requirement and you failed to provide the prompt that you are using for this essay so reviewing your essay based on content and discussion approach will be useless. \n I also noticed that you did not meet the minimum 250 word requirement. You only wrote 229 words, which means the corresponding points deductions for being under the word count will result in a severely low score for this essay discussion. Again, since I do not know what the prompt topic and discussion requirement is, I cannot hazard a guess as to how you could have improved your response to meet the word count. \n Based on these reasons, it should be obvious that your essay, when all the errors for the remaining scoring rubic are taken into consideration, will not meet the minimum 5 band score. Yes, I can make that conclusion even without knowing the main prompt requirements as the word count is an integral part of the scoring consideration and poses a heavy percentage of deductions when the minimum count is not met.","Your essay discusses the importance and benefits of teaching both the literature of a student's own country and international literature to children. This is a valuable topic; however, the response does not align with a typical essay prompt for English proficiency tests, such as the one provided in the human feedback. For future essays, it’s crucial to adhere closely to the given prompt to ensure that your essay is relevant and addresses the requested topic directly.

Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. **Relevance to the Prompt:**
   It appears that the essay does not directly answer a provided prompt. In proficiency tests, understanding and responding to the prompt accurately is crucial. Make sure to read the prompt carefully and craft your essay to directly respond to it. Consider what the prompt is asking for and how best to address it within your essay.

2. **Essay Length:**
   The essay does not meet the minimum word requirement of 250 words for many English proficiency tests. This could significantly affect the score. Expanding your essay by providing more detailed examples, adding additional reasons, or further explaining your points can help meet the word count and enrich your essay.

3. **Clear Argument and Support:**
   Your essay makes some clear arguments in favor of teaching international literature alongside national literature. You mention the benefits like understanding new cultures, enhancing employment opportunities, and improving standards of living. These are strong points, but they could be further strengthened with specific examples or studies that support these claims.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   While there are no glaring spelling mistakes, pay careful attention to grammatical structures and stylistic choices. Ensure that your sentences flow well and your ideas are clearly articulated. Sometimes, re-reading your essay or having someone else review it can highlight areas that might be confusing or could be improved.

5. **Point of View Clarity:**
   Your point of view is clear; you are in favor of teaching international literature. It’s beneficial to maintain this clarity throughout the essay. Remember, a well-structured argument helps keep the reader engaged and makes your essay more persuasive.

6. **Descriptive Arguments:**
   Your arguments are generally clear but could benefit from more description and depth. For instance, when discussing the opportunity to learn about new cultures, you could include an example of how this has positively impacted students or societies.

I partially agree that some people would make a purchase because of advertisements, but there are still some people make decisions depending on their real needs. \n Advertising is a good way to promote a new product and it has some influences on people's buying behaviour. In most of the dramas, some products are always shown in the specific plot and also the main roles introduce the function of products in order to catch the audience's attention. Such kind of marketing method is called product placement, which can persuade people to make orders. Smartphone, for example, is usually used to demonstrate its new function in dramas, so audiences easily get a good impression on it. The possibility for people to buy the products is therefore increasing. \n However, most people make purchases because of their real needs. While advertising could leave a good impression of products to people, they would think about the necessity of buying goods according to their income. Costumers would be impossible to buy products that they can not affordable on the ground that it may lead them to overdrafts. Some people, for an instance, who are indulged in buying designer labels, are not able to pat bill all a time. Once the new products hit them, they make orders without considering how much their income is. Therefore, they gradually have to pay lots of bills but could not pay it all in time.

As 2 separate words you are saying ""I am able but not able"" at the same time. However, the meaning of ""cannot"", one word, clearly means ""unable to"".

The argument is structured around two main points: the impact of advertising and the predominance of personal necessity and affordability in decision-making. However, to enhance this essay further and aim for a higher score, attention to specific details is essential.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay aptly responds to the topic, discussing the dual influence of advertising and real needs on purchasing decisions. The introductory and concluding sentences encapsulate this viewpoint clearly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:
   - The word ""cannot"" should be used instead of ""can not"" to effectively convey the meaning of being unable to do something.
   - Review how you phrase specific ideas for clarity and accuracy, for instance, ""customers would find it impossible to buy products they cannot afford on the grounds that it may lead them to overdrafts."" This adjustment avoids confusion and enhances the essay's readability.
   - Correct instances where grammar detracts from the clarity of your arguments, such as changing ""for an instance"" to ""for instance,"" and ""who are indulged in buying"" to ""who indulge in buying.""
   - Pay attention to phrasing for a more formal tone, e.g., ""to pay bills all the time"" instead of ""to pat bill all a time.""
   
3. **Clarity of Point of View**:
   Your point of view is relatively clear throughout the essay. However, reinforcing your standpoint in the conclusion by summarizing key arguments succinctly could strengthen the essay's overall impact. Remind the reader of why these points support your view effectively.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
   Your examples, such as the use of smartphones in dramas (product placement), effectively illustrate how advertising can influence purchasing decisions. Enhancing this argument could involve citing more diverse examples or incorporating statistical or research findings to solidify your points. Additionally, when discussing the importance of real needs and affordability, providing broader examples could offer a more comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Each paragraph should contain a minimum of three sentences to ensure the thorough development of ideas.
   - Uniform reference representations are important. Be consistent in referring to ""customers"" and ""products"" in plural forms to maintain clarity.
   - The conclusion would benefit from not only restating the essay's main view but also briefly reminding the reader of the supporting arguments presented.

From a personal viewpoint, I have to totally with the former. \n First and further, mothers have a closer relationship to their offspring because mothers get attached to the child from the birth. Kids spend most of their childhood with mothers. Therefore, a child is impacted more by his mom. In addition, a mother is the only person taking all sorts of care of the child, such as feeding, bathing and taking care of him when he is sick. Moreover, when a child grows up and goes to school, mother looks after kid's study, homework, project both at school and at home. Mother pays attention to every small things in everywhere relating to her child. \n Another interesting point is that women usually spend more time with their children than men because, in many countries, they are usually less engaged in working. Men play a crucial role of breadwinner and they cannot spend much time with children as women do. Thus, it makes mom-kid bond stronger. Apart from that, mother is the person who children usually confine in, share emotion, problems and ask for advices first.

Here's some constructive feedback to help improve your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's essential to ensure that your essay directly addresses the topic. Your opening could be clearer about what the essay agrees or disagrees with. It seems like you're responding to a debate on whether mothers or fathers have a more important role in parenting, but a direct reference to a specific statement or question you're addressing would make your position clearer right from the start.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are some minor grammar issues throughout your essay. For example, the phrase ""I have to totally with the former"" appears to be missing a word (agree). Consistency in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and pluralization would also enhance the clarity and professionalism of your writing. Moreover, try to simplify and clarify your sentences to make them more accessible to all readers, considering your audience might also include English language learners.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your viewpoint, favoring the mother's role in child-rearing, comes through clearly. However, enhancing the introductory paragraph to include the subject you agree with would prevent any confusion and set a strong foundation for your arguments.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: Your arguments are vivid and supportive of your position, but they could be more impactful if presented more concisely. The essay would benefit from condensing some points to adhere to a more structured paragraph length, aiming for balance across all sections. For example, your second paragraph is quite long and could be split or condensed to maintain a smooth flow and ensure each paragraph focuses on one main idea.

5. **Paragraph Structure**: Aim to create paragraphs that are not too long or too short. The ideal paragraph in this context should have around 3-5 sentences. This structure helps in maintaining the reader's attention and ensuring that your ideas are presented neatly and are easy to follow. Adjusting the length of your paragraphs accordingly can help improve the overall cohesiveness and clarity of your essay.

Remembering to present complete paragraphs is crucial for maintaining coherence. Each paragraph should introduce an idea, elaborate on it, and then link it to your overall argument without abrupt jumps or breaks in logic.

Lastly, ensuring that your essay directly addresses the prompt or question you're responding to will significantly improve how your argument is received and understood. If possible, explicitly stating the prompt you're addressing at the beginning of your essay can provide clearer guidance for your audience.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay addresses the importance of learning English well, focusing on its utility in education, employment, travel, information access, and social life. However, it is crucial to stay focused on explaining these benefits without diverging into comparisons with other languages, as such comparisons can detract from the essay's main point.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay could benefit from a more structured format. Dividing the content into clear paragraphs will help in organizing thoughts and making the essay easier to follow. Attention to grammar and punctuation, particularly with the use of connectors such as ""Firstly,"" ""Second,"" and ""Thirdly,"" will also enhance readability. Correct punctuation and careful use of conjunctions will avoid confusion. For instance, when talking about English not being the most spoken language, the phrase could be simplified to be more direct and relevant to the topic. Additionally, capitalization and formatting for emphasis need to be consistent and follow standard guidelines.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** The essay author's viewpoint is evident; learning English is portrayed as advantageous for multiple aspects of life. It would be even clearer if each point made about the benefits of learning English were elaborated with more specific examples or personal experiences, making the arguments more persuasive and relatable.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** While the essay lists several advantages of learning English, these points could be strengthened by providing more detail or examples. For instance, discussing how English proficiency can open specific job opportunities or citing examples of cultural discoveries made possible through understanding English would make the argument more compelling. Additionally, exploring how English facilitates access to global knowledge and cultural exchange in more depth would provide a stronger foundation for the essay's claims.

Personally, I believe that the benefits of this trend outweigh its drawbacks. \n In my opinion, the only disadvantage of storing information on the internet is that it increases the screen time, resulting in impact badly on our eye health. However, this problem can be solved by using the anti-bluelight glasses or we can use the anti-bluelight screen protector for our devices when we use the advanced technology such as smartphones, tablets, computers and so on to get the knowledge online and those things can be easily bought in every regions. \n By contrast, using the internet to store knowledge has many advantages. Firstly, qualified information on the internet is convenient to access as we can just stay at home to reach the knowledge online by some clicks or taps on our fingers; meanwhile, we have to buy books when the knowledge is stored in them that we may go to bookstores to buy them or shop them online, but the books may be damaged in the delivery journey. For instance, I bought a photobook on the Amazon website delivered from the United States. When I received it, the border and corners of the photobook were completely spoiled by external causes when it was being delivered. In addition, the quality of knowledge can be maintained all the time while the word in books can be faded in the long run. \n In conclusion, I think storing knowledge on the internet has more advantages than the disadvantages that it brings.","Excellent work in making it very clear to the examiner that you are stating your personal opinion throughout the essay. By using the correct pronouns, you will certainly increase your scores across all considerations, specially in the C+C and GRA sections. However, you should not have discussed the disadvantage in the essay. The idea is to prove that your opinion (advantage) is the correct one. So the discussion format should have been: \n Sentence 1: Perceived disadvantage \n Sentence 2: Reason it is seen as a disadvantage \n Sentence 3: Why it is an advantage \n Sentence 4: Give a supporting example \n Sentence 5: (optional) Additional connected supporting explanation \n You cannot prove that your idea should be listened to and believed by the examiner when you are trying to prove and disprove both sides. The job of the writer is to ensure that he always disproves the side opposing his own opinion. High scores are sure to follow if the writer can accomplish that.","This essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the given topic and presents a clear stance by emphasizing the benefits of storing knowledge on the internet. This clarity of personal opinion throughout the essay is a strong point, showing a good grasp of how to articulate and defend a viewpoint, which is crucial for scoring well in sections that evaluate coherence, cohesion, and grammatical range and accuracy.

However, the structure of the argument could be improved to make the essay's position more persuasive. Currently, the essay mentions a disadvantage but does not effectively argue against it to strengthen the author's main point. Instead of presenting a drawback and leaving it unchallenged, consider rephrasing it to show why this perceived disadvantage is, in fact, an advantage. This approach would strengthen the argument by directly addressing and refuting possible criticisms of the opinion expressed. A suggested structure for future essays could include: stating the perceived disadvantage, explaining why it is considered a disadvantage, arguing why it is actually an advantage, supporting this claim with an example, and, if necessary, adding an additional explanation that further supports the advantage. 

Additionally, there are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For example, ""resulting in impact badly on our eye health"" could be rephrased to ""resulting in a negative impact on our eye health."" Such adjustments will improve the readability and professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, while the use of personal experience provides a relatable example, the essay could benefit from incorporating more varied and detailed supporting evidence. This would make the arguments more compelling and comprehensive.

In conclusion, focusing on refuting opposing viewpoints, refining language use, and enhancing the support for the argument will significantly improve the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the essay. These changes will not only make the argument stronger but also help in achieving higher scores in assessments.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,3,Argumentative

Although I agree there are many drawbacks living in a foreign country, I believe it is possible to prevent and solve the problem and I will not see it in a negative way. \n There are many difficulties that foreigners encounter, such as loneliness, language barrier, and cultural differences. From my personal experience living in Mexico as a foreigner for two years, I had experienced all the challenges. For example, most Latin people are not always punctual or honest. Foreigners usually feel offended and upset when they do not keep their promises. The culture shock sometimes made me feel worse homesick and more struggle when I tried to communicate the problem with an unfamiliar language. \n However, I would still argue it is beneficial for both foreigners and the society. The experience could help not only foreigners but also local people widen their knowledge base and become more flexible in the future. Take myself, for example, I have learned to observe people from their actions instead of their words. I also become less judgemental while facing new problems because I know it is important to be humble and respectful all the time. This attitude can also help to eliminate misunderstanding and reduce potential social problems. \n In conclusion, I agree living in a foreign country is never easy but I believe it will not lead to serious problems by knowing how to adjust mindset whether being a foreigner or accepting foreigners in our hometown.","Wen, you immediately failed this task. Although you did write more than the required number of words, you are not discussing the prompt from the angle by which was indicated in the original instructions. You have misunderstood what the topic for discussion is. \n Actual topic: Living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language can cause serious social problems, as well as practical problems. \n Actual Subject: Having to speak a foreign language while living in a foreign country. \n Your Topic: Many people believe that living abroad results in social problems. \n Your Subject: Living abroad causes social problems. \n By separating the two areas for the subject of this essay, you can clearly see how you made the mistake. Your subject is different from the actual subject. The next set of errors that you made have to do with the discussion instruction: \n Original instruction: To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? \n Your Response: I believe it is possible to prevent and solve the problem and I will not see it in a negative way. \n You totally changed the discussion instruction from an extent essay to a positive/negative opinion discussion.

You failed to properly represent the original prompt discussion topic and requirements in your response and that is why this essay did not deliver the correct response.","Your essay attempts to discuss the impact of living abroad on individuals, focusing on social problems such as loneliness, language barriers, and cultural differences. However, there are several areas for improvement to better align with the essay prompt and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   - The essay was expected to specifically address the challenges of speaking a foreign language in a new country and how this could lead to both social and practical problems. Instead, your essay broadly discusses living abroad and its associated social challenges. Refocusing on the language aspect as the core issue could help align your essay more closely with the prompt. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
   - Overall, your essay is readable, but it would be beneficial to review grammar and punctuation to ensure clarity. For example, segments like ""I will not see it in a negative way"" could be clarified and strengthened to directly state your position, such as “I see it in a positive light because…”. Also, be mindful of generalizations, as in ""most Latin people are not always punctual or honest,"" which can be seen as stereotypical. Aim for more neutral language that focuses on your personal experience without generalizing about cultures.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
   - Your perspective is somewhat clear in that you acknowledge challenges but choose to view the living abroad experience positively. However, explicitly stating your degree of agreement or disagreement with the essay prompt, as per the task instructions, would enhance clarity. Phrases like “I slightly agree, but…” or “I mostly disagree because…” can help articulate your stance more effectively.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Essay Author's Position:**
   - While your experiences provide personal insight, they need to be more directly related to the issue of speaking a foreign language and its consequences. Consider including examples and arguments that directly address how language barriers contribute to social and practical problems, and how overcoming these barriers can mitigate these issues. Moreover, discussion regarding solutions or adjustments to these language challenges would strengthen your argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.

In conclusion, to improve this essay, focus more directly on the specific challenges of speaking a foreign language in a foreign country, as indicated in the prompt. Clarify your position on this issue, refine your examples to directly support your argument, and enhance the clarity and grammatical accuracy of your writing. Remember, specificity and direct engagement with the prompt are key to a successful essay.",3,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4707,https://essayforum.com/writing/dangers-putting-pressure-kids-87818/,dev,The Dangers of Putting Too Much Pressure on Kids,"Nowadays parents put too much pressure on their children to succeed. There are several reasons for these issues. One reason for this is development. We live in a tough competitive world now. As a result, all jobs require higher competencies and knowledge. If children do not struggle, it will be difficult for them to find a job in the future. Therefore, parents often force their children to study everything to improve their competencies. Another reason comes from love. Parents always want their children to have a better life. They think that being a successful person will bring a lot of opportunities for children. Besides, parents also hope that their children will complete their dreams which they couldn't achieve when they were young. Last but not least, parents often compare their kids to others. They do not want their kids to be worse than other children. If their kids can reach their goals, parents can be proud of them and tell their children's achievements to other parents. However, if parents put too much pressure on their children to succeed, it will be harmful to children's mental and physical growth. In conclusion, parents should put themselves in their kid's shoes to fully understand how difficult it is to give parents pleasure.","Let's start with the basics. You are writing an academic essay whose minimum word count is 250-290 words. Writing less than those number of words will not be beneficial to your final score. Deductions will be applied for the missing word count. Next, you need to properly format the paragraphs. You have to present anywhere from 4-5 paragraphs, depending upon the original prompt instructions. You can never compress the discussion into one paragraph due to the sentence topic requirements and discussion presentation format. You have to present 3-5 sentences in each paragraph. The sentences need to be complete in terms of: \n - Topic sentence \n - Explanation \n - Supporting discussions \n You have not really addressed the topic in a properly developed paragraph. You have to review the formatting requirements for a task 2 essay. You can use the other essays available here as an example of how you properly address this academic essay writing task.","This essay addresses an important topic: the impact of parental pressure on children's success. The essay successfully identifies and explains several reasons why parents might pressure their children, including the competitive nature of the job market, parental love and aspirations, and comparisons with other children. These points show an understanding of the topic and provide a clear view of the essay author's stance on the matter. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to elevate the essay's effectiveness and adherence to academic standards.

Firstly, it's crucial to meet the word count requirements for academic essays, which typically range from 250 to 290 words. Falling short of this range could negatively affect the overall score. Expanding on the arguments presented could help meet this requirement while offering deeper insights into the topic.

Proper paragraph formatting is also essential in academic writing. Splitting the essay into 4-5 paragraphs, each with 3-5 sentences, would enhance readability and organization. These paragraphs should include a topic sentence, followed by explanations and supporting discussions, to fully develop the essay's main points. The current structure, with the content compressed into a single paragraph, lacks this organization, making it difficult to distinguish between the introduction, body, and conclusion.

In terms of language use, while the essay is largely free from major spelling and grammar errors, attention to stylistic aspects could improve its flow and clarity. Phrases such as ""one reason for this is development"" could be rephrased for precision, for example, ""one reason for this pressure is the highly competitive environment of today's world.""

Lastly, making the conclusion stronger by not only restating the problems but also suggesting concrete solutions or a balanced viewpoint could offer a more rounded perspective. While the essay briefly suggests empathy from parents, expanding this idea could provide a more compelling conclusion.

Improving on these areas—expanding the content to meet word count requirements, properly formatting paragraphs, refining language use, and strengthening the conclusion—will greatly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the essay.",4,4,4,4,2,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4708,https://essayforum.com/writing/pros-cons-private-healthcare-system-86134/,dev,IELTS Writing task 2: Pros and cons of private healthcare system,"Essay: \n It is commonly believed that the extravagant price of health care has been attributed to the involvement of private enterprises, despite it being a fundamental need of every resident. The principle advantage of private health hospitals is that they offer better facilities than state-own institutions, while the main disadvantage is their high treatment cost making ordinary people impossible to access the healthcare services they need. This essay agrees that its demerit outweigh the merit. \n To begin with, providing high-grade equipment and labour force are the principle advantage of private medical care. This is because a private company makes enormous profits from the treatment fee of its patients, which is relatively higher than that in public hospitals. Consequently, a big proportion of this profit is invested back in equipping more advanced medical machines and facilities, as well as hiring and training top-notch specialists to serve its clients. For instance, in 2018, MedCare company allocated almost 55% of its profit to purchase MRI machines and building new treatment rooms for its patients. \n However, the main disadvantage of the private healthcare system is the high price itself. To be more specific, only the affluent have enough money to pay for the examination and operation which are conducted in private hospitals, while a person with low salaries may struggle to pay for medical bills. For example, a survey in 2019 indicates that an ordinary office worker would need up to one year to compensate for the money spent on one visit to a private hospital for general health examination. As a result, such poor people would not have equal access to the services in profit-making hospitals, despite receiving medical treatment is a basic necessity. \n In conclusion, although profit-oriented hospitals may offer equipments with higher quality than government-owned clinics, their high medical costs still outweigh this merit. If the private sector offers a supportive policy to lower the treatment fee, more people would have equal access to its state-of-the-art facilities which it provides.","You misunderstood the prompt requirement. This essay is not instructed to be written as an A/D essay. This essay asks an opinion question that you have to respond to: \n <em>Do the advantages of private health care outweigh its disadvantages?</em> Pick one side to defend in the essay. Why should you pick only one side to discuss when the question asks ""do the advantages... its advantages?"" The answer to that question lies in the discussion instruction itself. Had the prompt asked you to accomplish the following: <em>""Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give a personal opinion""</em> , then you should have definitely done the A/D format discussion. Since the question asked you to pick one side, then this is a single opinion essay, not a comparison essay. So your TA approach is all wrong for the essay and will definitely pull you back from achieving a 5 band score. \n Since you gave a direct response to the question, which shows you have a given opinion on the topic, the examiner will score your essay based only on the part that you wrote, which supports the stance you provided in the paraphrase. Therefore, your essay will fall under the minimum 250 word count and suffer points deductions for that. You have to learn to decipher what kind of essay you have to write in response to the given instruction or discussion recommendation. There are several ways of discussing this topic, but only one approach to the discussion question. That is the singular opinion approach. \n Based on the error in your approach, I will refrain from scoring this essay. It will not achieve a satisfactory band score. I would rather score your next essay, which I hope, will show a better understanding and approach to the given discussion topic.","The essay provided has strengths and areas for improvement that need to be addressed to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness in addressing the essay's prompt. Here’s detailed feedback focusing on the aspects suggested:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay's content needs to align more closely with the specific requirements of the prompt. The prompt asks for an opinion on whether the advantages of private health care outweigh its disadvantages. Instead of discussing both sides equally and then giving an opinion (as done in an advantages/disadvantages essay), the task requires you to argue strongly for one side throughout the essay. This means focusing your arguments and examples to support solely the stance you choose, making your case as compelling as possible.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
There are minor spelling and grammatical issues, as well as areas where word choice could be improved for clarity and impact. For example, using ""principle advantage"" should be corrected to ""principal advantage,"" as you're referring to the main advantage, not a rule or law. Enhancing the precision of language and correcting these errors will make your arguments more persuasive and your writing more professional.

3. **Clarity of the Essay Author's Point of View:**
While your essay states a clear opinion that the disadvantages of private health care outweigh its advantages, the structure of your argument doesn’t fully support this view consistently throughout the essay. To strengthen your position, focus your paragraphs on supporting your main opinion from the start, ensuring that each argument directly backs up your stance rather than equally discussing both sides.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:**
Your essay includes descriptive examples and arguments, such as the mention of MedCare company allocating profits for new equipment. However, to enhance your essay, ensure that all examples and arguments directly support your stance. Each paragraph should clearly contribute to making your case stronger. For instance, when discussing disadvantages, elaborating more on how these outweigh the benefits in a variety of contexts (beyond cost) could offer a more comprehensive view supporting your opinion.

**Additional Recommendations:**
To further improve your essay, consider these suggestions:
- Ensure your introduction clearly states your opinion so the reader knows your stance from the beginning.
- Develop your paragraphs with more specific examples that directly relate to your main argument.
- Consider the balance of your essay to favor the opinion you're supporting, rather than giving equal weight to both sides.
- Conclude your essay by summarizing how your arguments support your stance, reinforcing the strength of your opinion.

Remember, focusing on these areas for improvement will help in making your essay more aligned with the prompt's requirements and improve the overall clarity and persuasiveness of your argument.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

It gives the reader the idea that you are actually responding properly to the prompt requirement because you delivered an almost grammatically accurate representation of the original topic for discussion and the method by which you have to discuss it. As i rad your essay, I noticed that you used the name of a fast food restaurant that is exclusive to your area of the world. I suggest that you do not do that in your succeeding essays. As the examiner may or may not be familiar with certain things based upon your home country, it is always best for you to use more popular and international examples that most people might be familiar with. For example, aside from KFC, you could have used McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King, among others as examples of fast food restaurants. As for your conclusion, it could have been better written if you did not say ""By way of conclusion"" and instead said ""In conclusion"" instead. Also, a better wrap up of the essay is necessary since you are required to properly restate the discussion, reasons, and personal opinions yet again. Your conclusion did not accurately do that and also, came up very short in the minimum 3 sentence requirement for these essays.","Your essay makes a clear connection to the assigned topic, starting with a strong opening statement that sets the stage for the discussion about the impact of fast food on lifestyle and tradition. This shows you've understood the prompt and are ready to explore it in your essay. However, there are several areas for improvement to make your essay even better.

1. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some spelling and grammar mistakes throughout your essay. For example, ""when compare to the others in the past"" should be ""when compared to others in the past,"" and ""it brings many problems with we cannot guess"" should be ""it brings many problems we cannot guess."" Pay attention to your verb tenses and the structure of your sentences to make your essay clearer and more professional. Trying to simplify your sentences might help avoid these errors.

2. **Clarity and Descriptiveness**: Your arguments are generally clear, but they could be more descriptive and detailed. For instance, when discussing the health impacts of fast food, providing specific examples or statistics could strengthen your argument. Instead of saying ""it contains a great deal of fat,"" you could specify the types of unhealthy ingredients commonly found in fast foods and their direct effects on health.

3. **Use of Examples**: While it's great that you included examples of fast food establishments, try to use examples that are universally known. This makes your essay relatable to a wider audience. Instead of regional brands, mention global chains like McDonald's or Burger King. This small change can make your essay more accessible to people unfamiliar with specific regional brands.

4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion could be improved by avoiding phrasing like ""By the way of conclusion"" and opting for ""In conclusion"" to start your final thoughts. Additionally, make sure your conclusion does a better job of summarizing your main points and reiterating your personal stance on the issue. A conclusion should neatly wrap up your essay, restate the main discussion points, and reaffirm your viewpoint clearly and succinctly. Aim for at least three sentences to ensure your concluding thoughts are fully developed.

5. **Point of View**: Your point of view is clear, as you express concerns about the cultural implications of fast food popularity. However, delving deeper into your personal experiences or observations might add a unique and compelling layer to your viewpoint.

Overall, your essay tackles an important issue and provides a foundation for a thoughtful discussion. By focusing on these areas for improvement, your essay can become more engaging, persuasive, and polished.

There's the Tasmanian Devil, Wombat, Kangaroo, Platypus, Koala, there are so many I could ramble on for days. Our languages are so unique we casually throw around the phrase ""Dead Horse"" (ketchup) on a picnic. We also shortened the British ""Good day to you, madam!"" to ""G'day mate! Let's put a shrimp on the barbie."" Australia is also a very multicultural place. around 28.2% of Australia's population were born overseas, according Australian Bureau Of Statistics.

This is fun to read and it does take the reader on the journey of what it means to be an Aussie. However, I find that there are some points in the presentation where additional information is required before the information that you present.

So why not identify where you came from so that when you say you may not be a typical Aussie Bogan, the reader knows what you are talking about. That's the only part that I actually find a bit hard to understand in your writing due to what I feel, is a missing reference to connect the two statements.","This essay is a vibrant and engaging effort to address the topic of Australian stereotypes and identity. It successfully captures the essence of being Australian through personal insights and vivid examples. Here are some points for improvement and clarification to enhance the essay further:

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay effectively addresses the topic by challenging stereotypes and celebrating Australian uniqueness, culture, and biodiversity. It is clear that the intention is to break down clichés and share a more personal and inclusive view of Australian identity.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
    - Be mindful of using informal language and colloquial terms. While they add personality, ensure they are accessible to all readers.
    - Pay attention to the use of the word ""us"" at the beginning; ""Us, Australians are much more than you think"" should be ""We Australians are much more than you think.""
    - There is a slight inconsistency in the term ""multiculturalism,"" which appears as ""multicultralism"" in one instance. Ensure all words are spelled correctly for clarity.
    - The phrase, ""around 28.2% of Australia's population were born overseas, according to Australian Bureau Of Statistics,"" could be more smoothly integrated into the sentence for better flow.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
    - The personal viewpoint is strong and engaging, creating a sense of authenticity. However, expanding on the contrast between personal experiences and the stereotypes could add depth. For example, mentioning if the author's background deviates from the so-called ""typical Aussie"" would clarify the perspective and make the argument against stereotypes more powerful.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
    - The essay provides compelling examples to support the notion of Australian uniqueness, from distinctive wildlife to linguistic expressions and multiculturalism. An addition to enhance the essay could include more personal anecdotes or specific examples that highlight how multiculturalism has enriched the author's own sense of being Australian.
    - The connection between the statistical reference to Australia's diverse population and the author's individual identity could be made more explicit. Explaining how this diversity relates to the author's personal experience or broadening the concept of what it means to be ""typically Australian"" would strengthen the argument.

In summary, this essay is engaging and offers a strong personal perspective on the richness of the Australian identity beyond stereotypes. Clarifying the connection between personal background and the broader multicultural context, along with refining grammar and stylistic details, will make the arguments more robust and the narrative more coherent.",3,4,4,4,1,1,2,4,3,1,Narrative

4712,https://essayforum.com/writing/university-education-attendance-classes-94601/,dev,IELTS Task 2 - University education and attendance to the classes question - optional or mandatory?,"It is commonly believed that it is a must for university students to attend classes. Some, however, argue that students should have the right to choose whether go to class or not. As far as I am concerned, university students should be required to go to classes since it would help students gain life experience from professors' lectures and build teamwork skills. \n The students who skip classes have their reasons. The main one is they prefer self-learning time. They have said that attending class and learning knowledge they've already known is a pain. \n Although I could understand why some students don't go to class, I still insist that universities should strictly require students to attend class. \n In the first place, experienced professors could lecture their students on a wide range of knowledge outside the book so students could prepare for their future careers. \n In the second place, attending classes could also help students interact with other students to exchange information and gain confidence in public relations. \n In conclusion, there is a tremendous benefit from attending classes in university so students can have knowledge for life and learn from other students in class.","Since this is a task 2 essay, it should have at least 250 words written into it. You only wrote 192 words, The result of the non compliant word count is an immediate failing score. The reason for that is 2 fold: \n 1. Perdentage point deductions will be applied based upon the lacking word count leading up to 250 words. Based on the heavy lack of word count, the starting score for this essay will already be in the failed category. \n 2. The overall essay will be scored based upon the premise that the overall discussion is not fully developed. This is a reason that leads back to the shortness of the essay in terms of word count. \n These 2 reasons alone will be more than enough for you to fail the test. It is improtant that you write at least 250 words for the task 2 essay going forward to avoid the auto failing score.","The essay presents a clear stance on the importance of mandatory class attendance in universities, which directly addresses the topic question. This is a strength as it leaves the reader with no doubt about the position held on the subject.

However, there are a few areas where improvements could significantly enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Length of the Essay:** The essay is currently under the required word count for a standard task 2 essay. It contains 192 words, while at least 250 words are needed to meet exam criteria. Not reaching this minimum word count could lead to an automatic failing score for two main reasons: a) there will be deductions for each word below the 250-word threshold, and b) a shorter essay is likely to be seen as underdeveloped in terms of argumentation and content. To avoid these issues, aim to expand your discussion, perhaps by including more examples, adding a counterargument section, or elaborating further on the benefits of class attendance.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally clear, but there are minor errors and some awkward phrasing (""is a must"" could be revised to ""is necessary,"" ""they prefer self-learning time"" could be simplified to ""they prefer self-study""). Paying attention to sentence structure and word choice could make the arguments more persuasive and easier to follow.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The essay does a good job of making the author's stance clear. However, reinforcing this stance with more concrete evidence or examples could make the arguments more compelling. 

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** While the essay mentions important benefits of attending classes, such as gaining life experience and building teamwork skills, these points could be strengthened with more detailed explanations or specific examples. For instance, describing a particular scenario where class attendance directly contributed to a student's understanding of a complex topic, or providing real-life examples of teamwork skills developed through classroom interaction, would make the arguments more vivid and convincing.

In summary, the essay addresses the question and presents a clear viewpoint, which is commendable. To improve, consider extending the length to fully meet task requirements, refining language use for clarity and impact, and enriching the content with detailed support for claims made. This approach will not only meet the exam criteria but also make the essay more engaging and persuasive to the reader.",3,4,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, I completely agree with the opinion is that there is that there should be no restrictions given to artisans by the government. \n Artists who produce different kinds of artworks should be given the chance to do so as a part of their human rights. It is a fact that these kind of people have various and unique ways of presenting their opinions through their works of art that should be given the chance to be heard or displayed. Some arts enthusiasts consider these pieces of work as their motivation as well as their inspiration to continue pursuing their passion. One of the significant examples is that many creative artists used to be pioneers in producing artworks supporting for transgender people, but these were stigmatized and criticized by some countries policies. It is proved that artists should be free with their works for the advancement of the human being. \n Another reason worth considering is that it is a fact that these creations play a pivotal role in enriching culture and enabling the advancement of society. If artists used to abide country policies and please authorities with mass production, there would be no presence of nowadays masterpieces. However, the diversity of art comes from breaking the conventional political views or regional, bringing an open-mind and intellectual enlightenment. There are many tragedies and massacres due to undermining the dissemination of literature school, back to the time of Qing Dynasty. \n However, some advocates argue with opinion that government should have legislation on artist works because of their violence and deprivation. This can have negavtive impact on immature children, in other words it can lead to the destruction of a generation. \n In conclusion, the creative artists are indispensable in our society although some artists have tended to draw against the creed, and religion. In my opinion, the stricter rules and regulation are imposed to prevent artists from expressing themselves, the more monotonous in art people will see.","The prompt restatement iss acceptable. However, the extent Uspouse clarity was affected by the improper sentence structure: \n <quotation>I completely agree with the opinion </quotation> \n This is a redundancy that shows the writer is not looking out for less C + C deductions. It actually shows a lack of care for thought clarity in the presentation. The writer could have had a strong base score if not for that sentence formation error. \n In the first reasoning paragraph. The writer presents a valid opinion that would have been made more valid by a solid reference to say, the author's own experience or public knowledge , represented by the mention of a specific country.

As that opposes the actual opinion, it will be disregarded in the scoring process. As a single . essay, this must contain no more than 4 paragraphs. Both reasoning paragraphs must strengthen the opinion focus of the essay. If not for the unnecessary 3rd (opposing) reason, this would have been a positively solid scoring presentation.","The essay presents an interesting perspective on whether authorities should intervene in an artist’s creative process. The stance that artists should have complete freedom is clear throughout the essay. However, there are several areas in need of improvement to make the argument more compelling and the essay more coherent.

Firstly, it is essential to address the repetition and redundancy found in the introduction, particularly in the sentence, ""I completely agree with the opinion is that there is that there should be no restrictions given to artisans by the government."" Simplifying this sentence to ""I believe that artists should not face any restrictions from the government"" would make the point clearer and more direct. This revision not only enhances clarity but also demonstrates care in thought presentation.

The points made to support the thesis could be bolstered with specific examples or references. For instance, mentioning a country that censored transgender-related artworks could provide a solid base of evidence supporting the argument that artists’ freedom leads to societal advancement. It could also help to include references to specific artists or artworks recognized globally, as these details can strengthen the argument by showing the impact of unrestricted creativity on culture and society.

The essay might benefit from a more focused structure. Each paragraph should directly support the central thesis. The inclusion of an opposing viewpoint in the third paragraph is unnecessary for this type of essay, as the task is to argue a specific viewpoint. While acknowledging counterarguments can strengthen an essay, in this case, it distracted from the main argument without adding substantial value to your position.

Lastly, it is also important to review the essay for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Words like ""negavtive"" should be corrected to ""negative,"" and phrases like ""due to undermining the dissemination of literature school"" could be clarified for better understanding. Attention to such details can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of the essay.

In conclusion, the essay has a solid foundation with a clear point of view. Improving specificity with examples, refining sentence structure for clarity, and ensuring the essay directly supports the chosen stance will make your argument more powerful and persuasive. Simplifying the language will also make the essay more accessible, especially for those still mastering English.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, this is totally a benefit growth for the following reasons. \n There are several reasons to explain why this is such a useful improvement for us in the modern world. Initially, working or study at home will help to prevent us from the terrible air pollution which is one of the hottest issues worldwide. Because of the overpopulation, the means of transport has currently appeared more and more on the roads which will lead to air pollution on account of carbon dioxide that vehicles emitted. Due to this, stay at your own home to work or study will be a great idea to not only stop the congestion but also protect us from air pollution. In Viet Nam, the company called ""Vingroup"" has encouraged employees working at home to decrease the number of vehicles on the streets to protect the environment and stop the congestion happen as much as possible. Among them, 90% of people agree with this encouragement as technology prices have become much reasonable in addition to the convenience when they work. \n Furthermore, working or studying at home also helps us work and study more conveniently, in addition, to stay away from the crowds. Due to the congestion, people always get stuck when driving at rush hour which will make them late from work and study. On account of that, working or studying at home will be much more comfortable as they do not need to worry about being on time. Besides, it also prevents us from crowds to protect our health especially when we now have to face with COVID-19 pandemic. In the USA, 80% of residents are lean towards working and studying at home due to the convenience, technology prices, and also the pandemic that certainly affects their lives a lot. \n To sum up, adults and teenagers in this day and age prefer to work and study at home owing to the reasonable prices of technology. In my opinion, this is an absolutely positive change not only to protect us from air pollution, epidemic and make us more convenient with work, study but also help us to get on well with this modern worldwide today.","The writer could be considered an intermediate level English learner. The sentence presentations are mostly clear, logical, and relevant to the topic. The writer shows an analytical ability that is required of higher education students in the English speaking countries. Though not fluent yet, the writer manages to deliver almost properly structured sentences with a proper simple and complex sentence mix. \n The writer tends to use filler sentences though. This lessens the impact of the paragraph because an empty introduction to the topic is used. A sample sentence filler is, \n <quotation>There are several reasons to explain why this is such a useful improvement for us in the modern world.</quotation> \n Such statements are more useful as a part of the thesis presentation sentence, prior to the discussion topic listing. For example: \n <em>There are several reasons to explain why this is such a useful improvement for us in the modern world. These reasons include...</em>","In evaluating the essay on the topic of the growing trend of working and studying from home, it's clear that it addresses the topic directly and presents a cohesive argument in favor of this trend. The essay effectively highlights the benefits, such as reduced air pollution, convenience, and protection from diseases like COVID-19, which are strongly relevant in supporting the thesis.

However, there are areas for improvement to make the essay stronger and more impactful.

1. **Topic Response:** The essay aligns well with the given topic. It might benefit from a more nuanced introduction that directly states the reasons behind the trend of working and studying from home, rather than leading with a filler statement. Directly listing the reasons in the introduction can make the argument more engaging from the start.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are several spelling and grammar issues that need attention. Minor mistakes can detract from the overall professionalism and readability of the essay. For instance, “study at home” should be “studying at home” for correct verb tense consistency. Additionally, focusing on simpler sentences can help in avoiding confusion. Paying attention to prepositions (e.g., “In Viet Nam” should be “In Vietnam”) and the correct use of articles (""the"" epidemic, not ""epidemic"") will also enhance the essay's clarity.

3. **Clarity of Author's Viewpoint:** The author’s viewpoint is clear but could be made stronger by avoiding general filler sentences. Instead of stating there are many reasons why this trend is beneficial, specify these reasons early on to build a stronger, more focused argument.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** While the essay makes good use of statistics and examples, such as the initiatives by Vingroup in Vietnam and the preferences of the US residents, it could delve deeper into these examples. More detail on how technology enables working and studying from home and how it specifically addresses issues like pollution and health can provide a stronger base for the arguments made. 

5. **Engagement and Impact:** To enhance the essay's impact, try to introduce more dynamic language and concrete examples. Instead of general statements about air pollution and convenience, provide specific instances or data that highlight these benefits. Additionally, ending the essay with a powerful conclusion that not only summarizes the key points but also offers a vision for the future could leave a lasting impression on the reader.

In summary, focusing on direct and relevant introductions, improving grammar and style, clarifying and strengthening the argument with specific examples, and crafting impactful conclusions can significantly enhance the essay’s effectiveness.

Some people tend to think that GM foods might be a solution to this situation. There is some research has \n been conducted which point out the pros and cons of consuming GM foods. By reading various research I agree that GM foods can solve famine. Two reasons for that is the use of pesticides in agriculture and GM technology produce more crop yield compared to the normal way. \n Firstly, GM foods don't need to use pesticides to increase the supply they pull out. Using pesticides is not strange at all in our farming routine. There is several articles indicate that the disadvantage of pesticide on human's health is more than the benefit they brought to the world. For example, pesticides consist of various chemicals considered to be harmful to the consumer's health which sometimes lead to cancer. GM foods are considered to be healthier than non-organic kind. Genetically Modified supplies are likely to produce equal or even higher crops than the usual agricultural ways. \n The solution for supplying a huge population is simply think as the more the population grows the consumption of supplies are increase too. To be able to do that the amount of foods has to be enlarged also. GM foods are the optimal method suitable for this. Not only GM foods are healthier than other products, but they can produce a lot more crops also.

While the student appears to have understood the topic, he did not: \n - Present an accurate restatement \n - Provide a response according to the stated discussion manner \n Failure to provide these have resulted in a non- passing presentation.

It further argues that genetically modified (GM) foods could provide a solution to famine by eliminating the need for pesticides in agriculture and producing higher crop yields. The following points offer constructive feedback aimed at improving this essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay aims to address the discussion on whether GM foods are an effective solution to famine. However, it misses following the specified structure for discussion, which includes stating the extent of agreement or disagreement and basing the discussion on personal experience, knowledge, or public information. To strengthen the essay, it's crucial to directly address these requirements by explicitly stating your position (agree or disagree) and supporting your arguments with personal, knowledgeable, or publicly available examples or information.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: There are noticeable errors that disrupt the flow and coherence of the essay. For example, the use of multiple punctuation marks (""...."") and the abbreviation ""Etc."" detracts from the academic tone expected in such essays. Replacing ""...."" with a single period and avoiding casual abbreviations like ""Etc."" can improve readability and formality. Additionally, ensure sentences are complete and clearly convey your thoughts without creating confusion.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your viewpoint that GM foods can solve the issue of famine comes across, but it would benefit from a more structured and assertive presentation. Starting with a clear thesis statement that outlines your stance and the main reasons behind it would help readers understand your perspective from the beginning.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While you mention important points, such as the reduction of pesticide use and higher crop yields with GM foods, these arguments need more development and support. Including specific studies, statistics, or examples can strengthen your claims. Rather than stating general benefits, elaborate on how these advantages directly address famine's challenges. Discussing potential concerns and counterarguments related to GM foods and providing reasoning or evidence to refute them could also offer a more balanced viewpoint.

5. **Academic Writing Practices**: To improve the academic tone, avoid informal expressions and ensure proper punctuation and grammar use. Practice structuring your essay with clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each body paragraph should focus on one main idea and provide evidence or examples to support it.

In conclusion, focusing on structurally aligning your essay with the discussion requirements, improving grammatical accuracy, and providing clearer arguments with supportive evidence can significantly enhance your essay.

4716,https://essayforum.com/writing/railways-roads-consider-traffic-systems-76583/,dev,Railways vs roads - I consider both traffic systems equally important to our societies.,"Some people believe that governments should invest more money in railways rather than road systems. Personally, I disagree with this point of view because I consider both traffic systems equally important to our societies. \n On the one hand, I agree with the idea that states need to build well-functioned railways. Such public traffic system can help to cope with traffic problems, such as traffic congestion and car accidents. In Taiwan, for instance, our local governments have planned to spend lots of fiscal budget building railways. This policy certainly solve the problem of traffic jam, which had bothered local residents seriously. Another benefit of railway is that it is more eco-friendly. Trains powered by electricity do not generate harmful emissions and excessive carbon dioxide.as a result, railways can also help to protect our environment. \n Nevertheless, there are still some difficulties which can not be dealt with by trains. Firstly, railways must be built in areas with huge population, or they would not be financially efficient. Secondly, some regions, such as mountainous countrysides, are not appropriate to develop such public transport but more suitable to rely on roads. For instance, construction companies could find it hard to build railways on the hills. Finally, railway stations are located in fixed places but each individual person might have his or her destination. Even we take trains reaching the station nearby our destination, we still need to travel to there by cars or vehicles depending on roads. \n In conclusion, railways are so essential that governments should develop them, but I believe that we would have a more convenient society with well-developed roads.","Dear student, let's get one thing straight here. When you are given an opinion essay to write, specially one that specifically asks for the extent of your agreement or disagreement with a topic, such as in this case, you must signify that in the opening statement. You must choose only one point of view to discuss because of the descriptive instruction ""OR"" in the original prompt. The inclusion of the word ""OR"" means that you will discuss only the side that you support, not both sides. \n The way that you discussed this essay clearly shows that you do not understand the instructions provided and will cause an automatic failure of this essay in the actual test process. Your essay response does not accurately represent the requirements you were provided with and therefore, cannot be considered for grading past the first portion of the scoring criteria. You cannot be graded on the remaining sections when you have already failed to properly understand the English instructions for the discussion essay.

The correct approach to this essay would have been: \n There are some people who support the idea that the government should spend more money on the development of railway systems. Others believe that the government money would be better spent on developing road ways. In my opinion, I agree that the government should spend more money on developing the roads to a certain extent. \n Use 2 paragraphs to defend your stance then conclude the essay by saying; ""In conclusion, I would like to reiterate there is a requirement for the building of more roads as opposed to railways. This is supported by the fact that... In the end...""","Reviewing the essay, it's essential to address some critical aspects to help improve and align it more closely with the expectations for English proficiency tests, including response adherence to the topic, grammatical precision, clarity of the author's viewpoint, and the strength of supporting arguments.

1. **Adherence to the Essay Topic**: The essay topic requires choosing a side in the debate between investing in railways or road systems. It appears there's a misunderstanding of the prompt's expectations. Instead of presenting a balanced view on the importance of both systems, the essay should focus on arguing for one side. A clear stance should be stated from the beginning and maintained throughout the essay. For instance, if the argument is in favor of road development over railways, this position should guide the structure and content of the entire essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay needs attention regarding grammar and style. There are instances of missing articles like ""a"" before public traffic system and pluralization issues (e.g., ""solve"" should be ""solves""). Sentences like ""as a result, railways can also help to protect our environment"" should start with a capital letter. Additionally, consider using connectors and transition words to improve the flow between ideas.

3. **Clarity of the Essay Author's Point of View**: The essay's point of view is somewhat unclear due to the initial claim of disagreement with the prioritization of one system over the other, which contradicts the instruction to pick a side. To make the argument clearer, decide on one viewpoint and use the essay to support that choice fully.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position**: The essay includes arguments for both road development and railways, which dilutes the author's stance. Once a clear position is decided upon, every argument should support that view. For instance, if arguing for roads over railways, focus on the adaptability of road systems to various geographic conditions and their necessity for individual travel that railways cannot fulfill. Use specific examples and logically structured arguments to strengthen this point of view.

Improvements to the essay should start with a clear thesis statement in the introduction, indicating the chosen stance. Following paragraphs should each introduce a supporting argument, backed by examples or facts, leading to a conclusive summary reiterating the chosen position. Additionally, enhancing grammar and style will greatly improve the essay's readability and effectiveness in conveying the intended message.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,2,3,1,Argumentative

And about these countries, there have been a controversial debate between some people who insist that such countries have more advantages than disadvantages and others who believe that they will undergo more disadvantages than advantages. I agree with the former opinion for the following reasons in spite of some drawbacks. \n Those who are worried about drawbacks of relatively smaller number of older people in some countries argue that disadvantages from this situation are significantly harmful. Since older people learned how to live in the smart ways earlier than young adults, the lack of older people means the absence of opportunities to get precious knowhow of life from older people. As a result, it would cause more frequent possible mistakes all over the country. Furthermore young adults would have difficulty preserving their traditions without the enough number of older people to help them learn about traditions. Because tradition is spiritual directions leading a country, without it, people would suffer from predicament where they lose their identity. \n Despite those disadvantages, it seems to me that many young adults could bring profound changes to improve their country more than older people. First of all, younger people have the strength from the physical respect. That is they can contribute to the nation by offering their physical labor which older people are relatively hard to provide. For example, if some countries need reconstruction of social infrastructures because of natural disaster, younger people would be considerably important human resources to succeed in reconstruction quickly. Additionally young people are easier to absorb new knowledges and values compared to older people, a country dominated by younger people can deal with the recent global changes more efficiently. Therefore the advantages should be considered more importantly than the disadvantages when the number of young generation is larger than that of old generation. \n To sum up, even though lack of old generation would result in some disadvantages, in my opinion, having the larger number of young generation in a country has more advantages.","Lipo, writing 350 words without proof reading and editing the content of your essay before submission tells me that one of two things occurred while you were writing this essay: \n 1. You did not use a timer and decided to simply keep writing in the hopes that you will create a high scoring discussion essay. \n 2. You used a timer but ran out of time to proof read, edit, and revise due to the number of words that you wrote. \n While I do not care which of the two situations resulted in your writing 350 words, I do care that you showed a carelessness in writing about this topic. The biggest mistake that the test taker can make is to focus solely on writing for the sake of writing. The reviewer doesn't care about the number of English words you know about. He only cares that you can make yourself understood in written English. That is why the minimum word requirement of 250 was created. If you want to show off your vocabulary skills, don't write more than 275 - 300 words so that you will have to perfect the essay through the review process. Use a timer and make sure you complete your draft with at least 10-15 minutes to spare for editing time. \n You created good arguments for each discussion point. However, you overthought the reasoning aspect. Stick to one topic per paragraph so that you do not write too many words that cut into your all too important editing time. All of your reasoning paragraphs are sound, but comes across as under discussed because the second reasoning that you present is not fully threshed out for the reader to consider. Just stick to writing no more than 5 sentences based on a single topic. That is the best way to approach the writing of this type of essay. \n Now, since you are not being asked for a personal opinion in this essay, you should not make any first person references in the discussion such as ""In my opinion"". Instead, you should say something like ""All things considered"" or ""weighing the advantages and disadvantages, it appears that..."" or something similar. Never make a personal representation unless specifically asked to do so in the essay. \n In academic writing the word ""Because"" is not used to start a sentence as this is a connecting word. It can only be used in the middle of a sentence or after a comma. Do not use that word to start an academic discussion. You can only use ""because"" in any area within a written presentation if you are writing a casual or informal essay that does not follow strict academic and professional writing rules.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of having a larger number of young adults compared to older people in some countries. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the clarity and impact of the arguments presented.

Firstly, it's important to focus on keeping the essay concise and to the point. Writing more words than necessary can detract from the essay's effectiveness, and it's crucial to leave enough time for proofreading and editing. Aim for a word count that allows you to express your ideas clearly without exceeding the limit significantly. This approach ensures that you can perfect your essay through the review process.

Regarding the structure and content of the essay, try to stick to one main idea per paragraph. This will help in making your arguments clearer and more focused. Overcomplicating the reasoning or including multiple topics in a single paragraph can lead to underdeveloped ideas. Aiming for about five sentences based on a single topic per paragraph is a wise strategy for this type of essay.

In terms of expressing opinions, it's advised to maintain an objective tone unless the prompt specifically asks for a personal viewpoint. Phrases such as ""All things considered"" or ""weighing the advantages and disadvantages"" help maintain this tone and offer a balanced view without appearing subjective.

It's also crucial to pay attention to academic writing conventions. For instance, avoid starting sentences with the word ""Because,"" as it is traditionally used as a connecting word within sentences rather than at the beginning. This adherence to academic standards will lend your essay greater credibility and readability.

Moreover, there are spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. Ensuring correct punctuation, usage of articles, and verb tenses will enhance the overall quality of the essay. Engaging in proofreading and editing before submission is vital to identify and rectify these errors.

In summary, focusing on concise and clear argumentation, adhering to academic writing norms, and dedicating time to editing and proofreading will significantly improve the essay.

Considering different roles old friends and new friends play in our life, I tend to believe both of these abilities are contributory factors to a happy life. \n On the one hand, a few friends you have known for a long time are more likely to ensure the feeling of security, leading to a satisfactory life everyday. In our professional life, it is not uncommon we would encounter a series of moments when we feel frustrated about, namely, criticisms from our supervisors or office politics. Under those situations, the first thing we all want to do is call our closest friends out, have a talk to vent our anger and even cry over their shoulders, especially when we are far away from our hometown seeking for fortune in metropolis(metropolises). Anyone, no matter how high level his or her position is in one company, should have a small number of these friends, otherwise, we would easily get depressed. Unlike new friends, these bunch of friends are the ones we would always trust and feel secure to share. Therefore, it is evident that the ability to maintain friendship with our old friends means a lot to happiness. \n On the other hand, being able to make new friends easily is also important because new friends serve as refreshing elements in having a happy life. Hanging out with old friends is the time to catch up on with each other while knowing new friends is more like exploring an unknown place. Striking up conversation with strangers is an opportunity for us to step out of our comfort zone and to be exposed to unfamiliar environment full of surprises, which would definitely enrich our life. Only keeping the same group of friends is just like having the same dish everyday, which is, doubtlessly, very boring. New friends are like the new dishes you have never tried, serving to counteract the boredom in your life. For example, I usually would take part in one activity at the weekends. Everytime I exchange my contact information and social networking accounts with anyone I do not know I feel rather excited, because that means I may come across something new and curious. Like last Sunday, I just met a girl who managed to travel around the world while doing well in her job. Having talked with her, I learned so much that I could not know from books or any of my old friends. Her experience opens the door to a new world for me. \n In sum, for a happy life, I think we should both have the ability to keep friendship with old friends and have the ability to make new friends easily.","Dear student, Natasha, the question offers you the option to choose one of two responses. You either write a response that agrees with the argument presented or you write an essay that disagrees with the statement. You cannot write an essay that balances a ""maybe"" response because there is no ""maybe"" option in the essay. You cannot agree partially with both sides. That is not part of the equation. Choose only one of the two responses with which you develop your response. The reason that you need to pick one side of essay to respond to is because you are given the choice of ""OR"" in the statement. \n This essay, due to your lack of decision making in response to the question will most likely be considered a level 2 piece of writing. The reason for this is that you are using inappropriate explanations to support your response to the task. \n Don't get me wrong, this is an acceptable essay in terms of how you wrote it. The only problem, is that you did not appropriately respond to the task with a solid and convincing line of reasoning. You chose to not make a decision instead, which was the reason that your scoring was affected. When given a choice, make a decision. Pick one side to defend and stick to it in your reasoning presentation :-)","The essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the roles that old and new friends play in contributing to a person's happiness. However, it's important to focus on specific feedback to help improve the essay further.

1- **Response to the Topic**: The essay's approach to addressing the topic needs reconsideration. The prompt seems to offer a choice between two positions, suggesting that a clear stance—either agreeing or disagreeing with a specific viewpoint—is required. The essay, however, attempts to find a middle ground by arguing that both abilities (maintaining old friendships and easily making new ones) are important for a happy life. To meet the essay requirements more effectively, a definitive stance should be chosen and argued convincingly throughout the essay. 

2- **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay exhibits a good command of language, but there are some areas that could be improved. For example, ""befriending with strangers"" should be simplified to ""befriending strangers,"" and ""metropolis"" should be pluralized as ""metropolises"" to fit the context. Additionally, using more varied sentence structures could enhance the readability and flow of the essay.

3- **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: While the author's intention to value both old and new friendships is apparent, the essay does not fully commit to a single, clear point of view as directed by the essay prompt. Choosing a definitive position would not only align with the instructions but also provide a clearer framework for argumentation.

4- **Arguments Supporting the Position**: The essay includes descriptive arguments to support the idea that both maintaining old friendships and forming new ones are important. To improve, once a clear stance is chosen in line with the prompt's requirements, the arguments should be refined to specifically bolster that perspective. For instance, if arguing in favor of maintaining old friendships, examples and reasoning should focus predominantly on the unique benefits that longstanding relationships offer, rather than evenly discussing both sides.

**Overall Improvement Suggestions**:

- Revisit the essay prompt and select one position to argue for. This clarity of purpose will guide the entire essay.
- Work on refining the essay's grammar and stylistic choices for greater coherence and readability.
- Ensure that examples and arguments directly support the chosen position, making the essay more persuasive.

Remember, focusing on these aspects can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your essay and ensure it directly responds to the task at hand. Addressing these points will not only align your essay more closely with the requirements but also clarify and strengthen your arguments.",4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,4,1,Argumentative

Why is this the case?,"While the internet has revolutionized information access, newspapers continue to exert a profound influence on people's ideas. This essay will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon and argue that the influence of newspapers is a positive situation, shaping people's thoughts ethically and appropriately \n It is undeniable that the cause of this phenomenon lies in the meticulous and thorough process of censorship before publication. The published information must be strictly scrutinized from sources and the author's standpoints. Any information from unreliable sources should be discarded, and the author's opinion expressed in the news should be aligned with national social norms and beliefs. These causes lead to people's trust in newspapers, which influence people's thoughts. \n Additionally, Newspapers employ skilled writers who display impactful narratives and present arguments with logical structure. They use persuasive language, statistics, and expertise to support their claims, making their articles compelling. Therefore, their piece of news is a powerful tool for attracting a broader readership and imposing their perception. \n Some people argue that the influence of newspapers impedes people's critical thinking skills as people trust them and always receive the information without discerning its appropriateness. However, this statement is not valid. The authors' perception conveyed in the news shapes people's beliefs and guides readers to think appropriately and ethically. Their opinions are representative of their social beliefs. Therefore, they can be viewed as a favorable situation. \n In conclusion, newspapers continue to play a vital role in shaping people's ideas through rigorous verification processes, persuasive writing, and trustworthiness. While the digital age has brought about new information sources, newspapers remain indispensable as a reliable and ethical source of information. As the world continues to evolve, newspapers will continue to adapt and innovate, ensuring their continued influence on people's thoughts.","<quotation>This essay will explore the reasons</quotation> \n This does not respond directly to the writing prompt guide so your writer's opinion is incomplete.

This additional paragraph could result in your failing the test.","Your essay provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of newspapers in shaping people's ideas, despite the rise of the internet. However, to improve your essay and make it more compelling, there are several areas where revisions could be beneficial. 

Firstly, your introduction should directly address the prompt. When stating your thesis, make sure to briefly summarize the reasons or arguments that will be discussed in your essay. This approach ensures that your reasoning is complete and prevents any potential deduction of points for lacking a comprehensive thesis statement.

Regarding your claim that ""It is undeniable,"" it's important to recognize that every argument or perspective can be challenged. Hence, instead of making absolute statements, consider presenting your claim as a widely supported opinion or cite some evidence. This would make your argument more credible and balanced. You could say, ""Many believe,"" or ""Evidence suggests,"" to introduce your points.

You've included additional justification in your essay; however, focusing on providing a clear and concise argument is crucial. In exams, where time is limited, it's essential to stick to the required structure - usually one that consists of an introduction, a couple of reasons or arguments with explanations, and a conclusion. Expanding further in a limited word count or time frame might hinder your ability to thoroughly discuss your points, potentially impacting your score. Aim for clarity and depth in your main arguments rather than breadth.

Your essay's strengths lie in its clear point of view and the presentation of arguments supporting your position. The acknowledgment of the rigorous verification process in newspapers and the skilled writing they employ are compelling reasons supporting the trust and influence newspapers have. 

However, consider providing more evidence or examples to support your arguments. This will help refine your essay's persuasive quality. For instance, specific instances where newspapers have positively influenced public opinion or examples of newspapers adapting innovative practices could enhance your argument.

In your conclusion, you effectively summarize your essay's main points. Remember to also revisit the thesis and emphasize how your essay has supported it. This reinforces the structure and coherence of your essay.

Finally, pay attention to spelling, grammar, and style. Avoid overly complex sentences, and ensure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Aim for precision in your language to effectively communicate your ideas.

In summary, your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. By refining your thesis statement, supporting your arguments with evidence, maintaining a balanced view, and focusing on clear and concise writing, you can strengthen your essay significantly.

Some people argue that foreign tourists should be charged more for visiting these attractions. For my perspective, I cannot agree with this notion which, though, based on many plausible reasons. The forthcoming paragraph will show my explanations. \n Overcharging in specific areas will possibly decrease the number of tourist arrivals to those places and even of the whole region and country. The reason is because people always want to make value of their money and don't want to pay extra for a place rather than the others, unless they have other reasons such as working, meeting someone, etc. In fact, cheap historical and cultural places like Hoi An or Hue are beating early-popular but expensive place like Cairo or Paris. As a consequence, less money will be earned from tourism services. Therefore, less money is spent on preserving and upgrading those places. \n In a macro view, this change will downgrade regional and national image, which also leads to the falling of tourism. Obviously, people mostly decide the destination of their holidays or trips based on the places' reputation. They want to spend money lucratively through not going to places that have unreasonable prices. That means the higher the price, the less the profits. The 40% increase of visiting fee in AFA historical relic site in 2020 has bursted the rage of the public and has been removed just several days afterwards. \n To sum up, tourists being excessively charged in historical and cultural attraction is inappropriate and not economically beneficial. However, it is important to set flexible prices depending on particular situations for the sake of both tourists and service providers.","The prompt restatement section is acceptable enough. However, the lack of a properly referenced writer's opinion, using a clear thesis statement, negates your ability to clearly explain, in short form, the reasons for your opinion.

You cannot use a vague idea reference as its basis.. Points will be deducted for that. \n Try to avoid the usage of ""etc."" in a formal essay setting. That is not commonly used when writing academic papers as it denotes a lack of properly presented additional ideas. It is not important to make the reader believe that you have more to say. It is important that the reader understands the importance of the ideas you have presented in the paragraph. \n The example provided was good, but had grammar errors in the presentation. You need to have shown a proper grasp of the time frame reference of the English language. Clearly show that you know how to use English past, present, and future tenses.","This essay successfully addresses the topic by discussing whether foreign tourists should be charged more for visiting historical and cultural attractions. However, there are several areas that could be improved to strengthen the argument and clarity of the essay.

First, while the introduction hints at the author’s viewpoint, it lacks a clear thesis statement. A thesis statement is crucial as it informs the reader of the stance taken and the reasons behind this perspective. To improve, consider adding a sentence that directly states your opinion and briefly outlines the reasons supporting it. This will greatly enhance the reader’s understanding and set a clear direction for the essay.

Secondly, the usage of informal phrases such as ""etc."" should be avoided in formal essays. Instead, aim to fully elaborate your thoughts and provide specific examples or explanations. This practice demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic and reinforces the arguments made.

Additionally, while attempting to provide evidence to support your argument, the presentation of examples suffers from grammatical inaccuracies. Pay attention to the correct usage of verb tenses to accurately reflect the time frame being discussed. For instance, when mentioning events or situations that have already occurred or were specific to a certain period, ensure your verbs accurately reflect past action. This attention to grammatical detail lends credibility to your essay and showcases a strong command of English.

The example of the AFA historical relic site’s fee increase is relevant and could be a strong argument, but the explanation around it needs to be clearer and grammatically correct. Clarify the sequence of events and the reactions to make your point stronger.

In conclusion, while your essay presents a valuable viewpoint, focusing on creating a clear thesis statement, avoiding informal language, and ensuring grammatical accuracy will significantly improve your argument’s effectiveness and the overall quality of your essay. These adjustments will make your position more compelling and easier for the reader to understand and follow.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Therefore, there is no need to write such an academically formal concluding paragraph. The best point to have closed this essay would have been in the paragraph before the concluding paragraph that you wrote. It is important that you understand the kind of essay that you are being required to write before you write it because you need to make sure that your writing skills reflect the proper requirements of the essay type. \n Admittedly, your English grammar skills are nowhere near academically acceptable due to the numerous flaws that were pointed out previously. However, if you had managed to write the essay in the expected manner, then you would have at least, presented the proper format for the essay. For the opening statement, you did not need to create such a flowery introductory statement. Simply stating the expected discussion would have been enough. Remember, you are writing under a time constraint. This is not the time for creative writing presentations. A direct to the point narrative essay would be best in order to help you complete all 3 sections of the test within the allotted time.","This essay presents a personal narrative that shares a journey of taking risks and the rewards that come with perseverance and hard work. It's important to align your writing with the specific type of essay you're asked to write. In this case, the narrative form allows for a more personal and less formally academic tone, particularly in the conclusion. The essay would have benefitted from ending with the narrative climax—the moment of achievement—rather than adding an academically formal conclusion.

Regarding structure and content, the essay successfully addresses the topic by illustrating through personal experience the value of risk-taking and hard work. This personal story clearly supports the assertion that taking risks is essential to achieving success, making the point of view of the essay author clear. However, focusing more on specific examples and emotions associated with these moments can enhance the descriptive nature of the narrative, making the argument more compelling.

The introduction of the essay could be more straightforward. Aim for clear, direct opening statements that introduce your narrative without unnecessary embellishments. Remember, clarity is key, especially under time constraints.

There are several areas where the essay can improve linguistically. It is vital to work on grammar, spelling, and stylistic issues to ensure your essay is academically acceptable. Some common mistakes include incorrect verb tenses, improper word choices, and a lack of comma usage, which can hinder the clear expression of ideas. Additionally, maintaining consistent tense throughout the narrative can help improve readability and coherence.

For example, attention to detail like changing ""It is hard to believe that the successful people have not taken any risk at any point of their lives"" to ""It is hard to believe that successful people have not taken any risks at any point in their lives"" makes your writing more precise and grammatically correct. Furthermore, ensuring proper and varied sentence structure can significantly enhance the flow of your essay.

Another key area for enhancement is the use of transitions and connectors to ensure a smooth flow of ideas, making your narrative more coherent and engaging. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to maintain the reader's interest throughout.

4722,https://essayforum.com/writing/money-true-indicator-success-business-93911/,dev,Is money a true indicator of the success of a business?,"Success can be defined in various ways. Some people suppose that money is the only yardstick for labeling a business as successful. I agree with this viewpoint to a certain extent; however, I believe there are many other criteria to be considered when evaluating an organization's prosperity. \n On the one hand, the revenue a company can generate is the most noticeable sign of its success. The majority of people tend to be under the assumption that the most flourishing companies are the most lucrative ones. In other words, the ultimate objective of almost every enterprise is to maximize profits, which implies that financial gain is the benchmark for determining whether a business is thriving or not. Take Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon as an example. They are included on the list of the world's most successful global brands, as measured by the amount of money they earn. In addition, companies, especially start-ups, can not reap success if they fail to make profits. Large corporations typically offer capital injection for new firms based on their financial outcomes. As a result, a start-up without revenue growth may not receive financial support and eventually struggle to survive in the competition. \n On the other hand, I contend that besides financial metrics, customer satisfaction and societal contributions are also vital parameters to gauge a firm's triumph. The company's ability to provide goods and services that meet the demand of every purchaser will create an extensive client base, together with brand loyalty. This ensures enterprises' long-term success and consolidates their position in the market. According to billionaire Richard Branson - the founder and chairman of the Virgin Group, true success should be measured by the customers' level of happiness so that the achievements would be long-lasting and valuable. Moreover, numerous non-profit organizations focus on eradicating global issues such as poverty, pollution or healthcare problems to improve the community. Their success is judged by the positive impacts they have on the individuals and society as a whole, rather than their earnings. \n In conclusion, although money is an important criterion to mark the success of a business, consumer fulfillment and beneficial influences on society are also the deciding factors.","There are specific questions being asked as a part of the writer's opinion presentation. While the writer did his best to deliver the correct restatement + personal opinion, the relevant paragraph failed to deliver because of 2 problems: \n 1. He provided a prompt deviant discussion point by indicating \n <quotation>I agree with this viewpoint to a certain extent</quotation> \n which is not a part of the discussion consideration for this prompt. This is actually a totally different prompt discussion instruction so it should not be referred to in this paragraph at all. It created heavy deductions due to an irrelevant response and unclear opinion presentation. \n 2. He failed to give direct topic responses to the 2 questions which would have comprised his opinion response. As such, the writer did not fulfill the clear writer's opinion presentation requirement for the paragraph. \n These errors will result in a non-passing preliminary assessment score for the paragraph. \n The discussion format is also improper as the essay base questions are not based on related discussion points. Therefore, a comparative reference referring to \n <quotation>On the one hand</quotation> \n and \n <quotation>On the other hand</quotation> \n cannot be used. These are not the correct transition phrases to use in this case because the requirement is more along the lines of a transition sentence, due to the differing discussion focus of the questions. Though based on a single topic, the discussion targets are different and unrelated. \n When considering the basis of the first question, the paragraph that the writer developed in reference to it is not totally convincing because the premise is based on big business rather than the SME's. A big business is already financially stable and therefore, cannot be considered the correct basis for this discussion. It is already a financial success. The presentation in that paragraph is not really applicable as presented. \n The second reasoning paragraph is more aligned with the question it is responding to. So this is the paragraph that can receive full scoring considerations. The problem is that the first reasoning paragraph will pull back the scoring consideration due to the incomplete and mostly improper discussion presentation. \n There is a misplaced apostrophe usage in this essay. It was used to indicate the plural form of a the word customers, which was unnecessary because the plural form does not use an apostrophe in its indicative form. An apostrophe S would have represented an ownership discussion point. That said, it is important to note that the correct word construction would have been the plural form, without any apostrophe usage. \n A concluding summary was necessary in this essay. The writer tried to provide one but he did not use the correct 40 word, 2 sentence minimum format for the paragraph so it cannot receive full TA considerations in terms of response format either.","The essay addresses the topic of how to define the success of a business, arguing that while revenue is significant, other criteria like customer satisfaction and societal contributions also play crucial roles. This approach recognizes different facets of success, which is a strength of the essay. However, to make the essay more effective and aligned with English proficiency testing standards, there are several areas for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Relevance**: The introduction implies a conditional agreement with the idea that money is the sole indicator of success, stating ""I agree with this viewpoint to a certain extent"". This can mislead as the essay's prompt does not specifically call for a partial agreement but rather a discussion on the broader understanding of business success. It's essential to directly state your perspective clearly and stick closely to the prompt's requirements to avoid any ambiguity or irrelevance.

2. **Argument Development**: The essay uses a comparative structure (""On the one hand... On the other hand..."") that might not be the best choice here. While comparing different viewpoints can be effective, each point made must directly respond to the essay question. Ensure that each paragraph's main idea is clearly linked to the essay's thesis to maintain focus and coherence. Specifically, discussions on big businesses like Apple or Amazon may not fully address the breadth of the question which could include smaller enterprises. An approach that considers a variety of business sizes could provide a more comprehensive argument.

3. **Use of Examples**: The essay benefits from referencing figures like Richard Branson and organizations to illustrate points on customer satisfaction and societal impact. This effectively supports the argument that success is multifaceted. Continuing to use specific, relevant examples will bolster arguments and engage the reader.

4. **Technical Accuracy**: Be cautious with grammar and punctuation. Specifically, the essay misuses an apostrophe in making a plural (e.g., ""customers'"" instead of ""customers""). Remember, apostrophes are used for possession (e.g., ""the customer's feedback"") or contractions, but not for making words plural. 

5. **Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph attempts to summarize and reaffirm the essay's main points. However, it could be enhanced by clearly restating the thesis and main arguments in a concise manner, ensuring it adheres to the format requirements, possibly following a more structured word and sentence guideline if specified in the test instructions.

In summary, the essay engages well with a complex view of business success, but improvements in clarity, relevance to the prompt, argument development, technical accuracy, and a more structured conclusion could enhance its effectiveness and coherence. Focusing on these areas can make the argument more persuasive and ensure it fully meets English proficiency testing standards.",3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

In many cases, instead of complete lots of paperwork, users could quickly get an account for bank or for Email. By providing personal information online, people save time doing these registrations. For instance, users who want an account for twitter could do it via online on smartphone any where and anytime they want. Beside, one social media account could sign up for multiple things. Such as, Instagram link to Facebook. Users can administrative their accounts by provide their phone number or email address to get verified. This feature is useful when some invader trying to illegal invasion one's online accounts during an emergency. \n On the other hand, there are several problems if one's personal information online is leaked.

This is the discussion question that requires the personal opinion of the writer in the form of a thesis statement. This was not responded to in the opinion statement of the writer in the first paragraph. Additionally, the prompt / topic restatement was also altered by the writer, thus creating a totally different discussion presentation for the essay. Such a serious prompt deviation will automatically result in a failing score due to the inability of the writer to properly understand the original prompt, lack of an ability to restate the topic, and a failure to deliver an appropriately formatted discussion opinion at the end. \n The reasoning paragraphs do not provide the correct response either. The focus of the reasoning must be on proving either an advantage or disadvantage. This is still a single opinion essay, rather than a comparative analysis. Why? The discussion instruction asks a single question, it does not ask the writer to do a comparative discussion by saying ""Compare the advantages and disadvantages"". Rather it asks ""Is it an advantage or a disadvantage?"". The word ""or"" referring to an option to choose one or the other, but never both sides. \n Overall, the essay does not meet the necessary requirements for a passing score even though the writer did his best to present what would have been a fantastic comparative presentation. It is unfortunate that the essay did not require a comparative discussion. If it had been so, then the writer would have passed, instead of failed the test.","The essay is aimed at discussing the safety and privacy concerns related to the use of online platforms, such as social media and banking.

Instead, it strays into a general discussion on the risks and conveniences of online accounts without asserting a clear stance on the comparative weight of these pros and cons as related to social media specifically. 

First, it is crucial for the essay to begin with a clear thesis statement that reflects an understanding of the question and presents a distinct viewpoint. This thesis should guide the remainder of the essay, with each paragraph specifically supporting the chosen stance. In this case, the essay should have focused exclusively on either the advantages or disadvantages of social media, taking care to directly respond to the question posed.

Regarding content and structure, the essay does attempt to discuss relevant points about the ease of setting up online accounts and the potential risks of personal information being compromised. However, these arguments need to be more clearly aligned with a singular perspective on social media's benefits or drawbacks, offering specific examples and reasoning to support the thesis.

Several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues also detract from the essay's clarity and effectiveness. For example, there are misspellings (""sceptical"" should be ""skeptical"", ""bored"" should be ""bothered"") and grammatical errors (""a lot of people sceptical it security"" should be ""a lot of people are skeptical about its security"", ""for me, I think"" is redundant). Additionally, phrases could be more concise, and the overall essay structure can be improved for better flow and coherence.

To improve, the essay should:
1. Start with a precise thesis statement that clearly answers the question.
2. Organize paragraphs around clear, focused arguments that directly support the thesis.
3. Use specific examples to bolster claims.
4. Address spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues to enhance readability and effectiveness.

Also, human would lack oxygen to survive as well as food and medicine supply for daily activities. Consequently, life on this plant would not even exist. \n On the other hand, the impact of various environmental problems including global warming leads to greater degradation. Human activities like deforestation or over-abusing of non-renewable resources lead to changes in climate that result in extreme weather events for instance ice melting, ozone layer depletion, and so on. Moreover, rising the Earth's average temperature is one of the causes of the loss of some specific species. For example, an increase in water temperature is turning coral reefs into deserts. Marine species have to face up to habitat destruction as a result. Hence, the loss of animals and plants is just a small part of the big picture. \n In conclusion I think a reduction in biodiversity is a major concern to human but that people become aware of other more important issues like rising temperature might be a solution on a whole. In a long term, more environment preserving approaches should be introduced and implemented with the help from both authorities and citizens.","The paraphrased introduction is incorrect. There are two points of view prior to your personal opinion to be discussed. Your presentation totally omits informing the reader of the proper discussion requirements based on the original information in the paraphrase. Therefore, your TA will have point deductions for only being partially applicable in its understanding and presentation of the discussion instructions. \n Your discussion paragraphs do not differentiate between POV 1, POV 2, and your personal point of view. The discussion paragraphs makes it appear that you are presenting a personal opinion overall. Topic sentences that represent each point of view at the start will help resolve that error. \n The essay does not have a proper concluding summary either. You cannot discuss a personal opinion in closing as that is supposed to be one of the 3 discussion paragraphs of the required 5 paragraph presentation. The 5th paragraph is the concluding summary.","Your essay addresses an important topic regarding environmental degradation, offering perspectives on both biodiversity loss and global warming, before presenting a personal viewpoint. This structure demonstrates an attempt to cover various aspects of a complex issue, which is commendable. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, structure, and argumentation strength.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to address the topic by discussing the importance of biodiversity and the pressing issue of global warming. However, the introduction doesn’t accurately set up the essay structure or clearly delineate between the different points of view that will be discussed. Clarifying the scope of discussion in the introduction, by specifically stating the key points that will be covered, would make the essay more effective and aligned with the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally well-written but could benefit from careful proofreading to correct minor grammatical errors and enhance readability. For instance, “living organisms and nature together create an ideal environment” might be better expressed as “living organisms and nature together create an ideal environment.” Additionally, using varied sentence structures can make the argument more engaging.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** The essay's point of view gets somewhat mingled with the general discussion, making it challenging to distinguish the author's personal stance from the overview of the issue. To address this, explicitly introduce each section—whether discussing a general point of view or personal perspective—with clear topic sentences. This distinction will help clarify your position and strengthen the overall argumentation.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay presents reasons for the significance of both biodiversity loss and global warming, these arguments could be enhanced with more specific examples, evidence, and a clearer connection between these issues and their broader implications. Detailed support and examples fortify an argument, making it more persuasive. Additionally, addressing how these issues interconnect could provide a more nuanced discussion and enrich the essay's depth.

5. **Conclusion:** The essay’s conclusion should succinctly summarize the key points discussed, reinforcing the importance of the topic and the author's stance. Rather than introducing new opinions, the conclusion should reflect upon the arguments made, emphasizing the critical takeaway or suggesting actionable steps based on the discussion. This will provide a more satisfying and coherent closure to the essay.

By refining these aspects, the essay will not only meet the task requirements more effectively but also provide a more compelling and structured exploration of a globally pressing issue. Remember, clear structure and articulation of your arguments are as important as the arguments themselves.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

It is believed that job fulfillment renders workers a pointless life that they devote a large amount of time to nine to five jobs. However, I personally assert that there are other factors that are of greater concern than job satisfaction. \n It is crystal clear that if amusement cannot be found in their workplaces, it is hard for them to get higher promotions. To illustrate, they are likely to put in poor work performance that is not highly recognized by their boss and co-workers. Another reason is that such long-working hours without job fulfillment can wreak havoc on other aims in their lives. That is to say, limitations in social cycles are unavoidable for those who have occupied work schedules. For instance, it is hard to hang out with new friends and have a company with them, which lessens chronic stresses associated with workloads. \n Nevertheless, there are several justifications of the opposite viewpoint that I convinced. Firstly, in today's cut-throat labor market where thousand graduates face unemployment annually, they are more concerned about job security helping them to earn enough money to pay for mortgages, bills and everyday living costs for their families or their own because they have to put family responsibility ahead of their personal benefits. Secondly, working in a prosperous working environment can boost your wrongful mindset about the job. For example, some people decide to go on an unsatisfied job because of their successful colleague giving positive incentives to them. \n In conclusion, although some people conquer the statement that those who spend all day at work find life useless due to no satisfaction, I personally believe there are some other aims in life forcing them to keep their job.","Your original prompt is incomplete. it does not provide the reason why people would think that life is meaningless without job satisfaction. Since I do not see any proper prompt paraphrase in your opening paragraph, I cannot say that you did a good job at paraphrasing the prompt. You also failed to follow the discussion instruction because, even as you assert an opinion, you do not provide the extent or reasons for your opinion. In fact, a closer review shows that you did not even respond properly to the prompt question. \n Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?"" \n Response: I personally assert that there are other factors that are of greater concern than job satisfaction. \n Based on the error in your discussion slant, your essay will be judged as offering a response totally unrelated to the task provided. This is one of the lowest scores possible in the TA section, which almost assures you of a failing score with this presentation. Why the failing score? Well, your essay also has spelling, cohesiveness and coherence issues, and improper word usage which will all add up to further lower your score. \n Next time, make sure you understand the discussion requirements first so that you will not deviate from the prompt as provided. You can review the other essay samples here to help you better understand the topics used and how it should be discussed.","The essay provides a perspective on job satisfaction and its significance in an individual's life, which is a good effort towards addressing the prompt. However, to enhance your essay and align it more closely with the essay prompt, consider the following points:

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's crucial to ensure that your essay directly answers the question asked. The essay question often requires you to express the extent of your agreement or disagreement with a statement. In this essay, the stance is mentioned, but there is not enough emphasis on explaining why there are other factors of greater concern than job satisfaction, nor is there a proper paraphrase of the prompt. Next time, try to clearly state your position and directly address the prompt, mentioning the extent to which you agree or disagree and why.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay is intelligible, there are some issues with word choice (""renders workers a pointless life"" could be more clearly expressed), spelling, and sentence construction that could hinder its coherence and overall flow. Consider revisiting word usage (""wrongful mindset"" might not convey the intended meaning) and grammar to improve readability and clarity. Additionally, simplicity in language and structure can greatly benefit comprehension and engagement with your audience.

3. **Clarity of the Point of View**: Your point of view appears in the essay, but it's somewhat overshadowed by the presentation that lacks a detailed reasoning behind your stance. It’s important to make your perspective clear and to support it with compelling, logically structured arguments.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay attempts to support the position with examples and reasons, which is commendable. However, these arguments could be more detailed and directly linked to how they support your viewpoint. For clarity, ensure each paragraph focuses on a single idea, and use examples that clearly illustrate your points. Discussing the relevance of job security and societal expectations is good, but make sure to elaborate on how these factors weigh against job satisfaction in your view.

In conclusion, focusing on directly answering the prompt, refining your grammar and spelling, clarifying your argument with more explicit examples, and ensuring a clear, consistent point of view throughout will significantly improve your essay. Understanding and sticking to the discussion requirements is essential to avoid deviating from the topic. Reviewing sample essays and focusing on these areas will help in crafting a more coherent and persuasive essay.

To ease and solve the worldwide crisis, it must be looked into the core of the issue and take on actions immediately. \n From my perspective, the primary factor of hunger is poverty. The profit-oriented corporations set high price of farming fertilizers, for those countries that suffer from poverty certainly can't afford. Meanwhile, with poor situation in finance, they undoubtfully are not capable of accessing the latest agricultural guidance. Afterwards, farmers use no or artificial fertilizers, which will lead to an unhealthy soil with high salt level. Exploiting the farmland through numerous cycles, the products become less rich in nutrient and minimal in outputs. People are not able to consume enough, later on suffer from hunger and starvation. \n Despite of the depressing situation, there are some actual actions can be put into practice, after all, every cloud has a silver lining. Governments should seek aids form world organizations, regardless of finance aid or agricultural guidance. Cutting the chase, the most direct assistance surely is to accept huge means of money. For fear that the aid be misused, a practical method is to send agriculture assisting team, assuring the aid won't be manipulated by corrupted governers. \n To sum up, in my opinion, poverty is the main reason of hunger, coping it with assistance of charity groups, it is affirmative that starvation will ultimately come to an end.","You are not offering a correct paraphrase of the original prompt. You have totally changed the information provided in the original prompt. Therefore, you will lose points. You need to properly paraphrase the original presentation using only the provided information. Do not add, remove, or offer information not included in the original prompt. This will result in a low TA score for you. When that happens, you might find it difficult to pass the test because of a low starting score. \n Do not use contractions in your presentations. Always spell out the whole word because you are writing in formal English. You cannot say ""don't"", you have to say ""do not"" in order to reflect the required academic and professional tone of the essay. \n Your reasoning for hunger is incorrect. Your presentation topic, farming fertilizers does not relate to hunger directly. You could mention the cost of food, the lack of groceries in a particular location, or the high cost of food. Farming fertilizers are a totally different, unrelated topic. As you can see, your essay deviated from the topic when you discussed fertilizers, you focused on soil quality rather than hunger. So the prompt deviation will make this essay fail the test. If you do not discuss the required topic, then you cannot be scored based on the topic discussion indicated. \n Do not use English phrases / idioms that will show your lack of English knowledge (e.g. every cloud has a silver lining, Cutting the chase). Do not try to show off when you are not at the level of a native English speaker yet. That will be unwise because errors in the LR and GRA section will greatly affect your final score.","Reflecting on the essay, there are several areas where improvements can be made to better align with English proficiency standards and the guidance given in feedback. Here's a detailed assessment focusing on adherence to the topic, language use, clarity of argument, and support for the position taken:

1. **Response to the Topic:** It is crucial to stay true to the original prompt provided for the essay. Misinterpreting or deviating from the prompt can significantly impact the assessment of the essay. Ensure that the essay paraphrases the prompt accurately, without adding, omitting, or changing information. Sticking to the information given in the prompt is essential for a higher score.

2. **Language Use:** Formal English requires certain conventions to be observed. Avoid the use of contractions (e.g., use ""do not"" instead of ""don't""). This contributes to the academic and professional tone expected in such essays. Additionally, the usage of idioms or phrases that might not translate well in an academic context (e.g., ""every cloud has a silver lining,"" ""Cutting the chase"") should be avoided. Instead, focus on clear and direct language that accurately conveys your argument.

3. **Clarity of Argument:** The essay should directly address the topic at hand. In this case, the connection between the primary argument (the role of farming fertilizers in hunger) and the broader issue of world hunger needs to be clarified. The current argument suggests a somewhat tangential issue rather than directly tackling the root causes or solutions to hunger itself. Consider refocusing the essay on more directly related issues, such as the accessibility and cost of food, which tie more closely to the topic of hunger.

4. **Support for Position:** While the essay makes an effort to argue a point, the reasoning presented is somewhat unfocused. The connection between poverty, the cost of farming fertilizers, and the broader issue of hunger is not entirely clear. It's important to build a coherent argument that directly supports the position taken. This includes providing evidence or examples that directly relate to the core issue being discussed.

To improve, try to focus more on straightforward explanations and directly relevant arguments. Simplify the language to ensure clarity and correctness, and ensure all discussion is closely tied to the topic.

While I agree that it is impossible, I consider that it is useful for the student. \n On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why establishing too many universities is not possible. Firstly, the government will have to spend more on building universities. Furthermore, The cost of running and maintaining these schools to educate the students would be very high and the government does not receive benefit from this. Second, admission would be less competitive, as such, the standard of university would be lowered.

The arguments presented are structured into pros and cons, which helps in understanding the different aspects of the argument. Here are some constructive points to improve the essay:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the issue of whether it is possible and beneficial to increase the number of universities. It's important to ensure that the essay sticks closely to the topic throughout. Make sure to clarify the essay question in the introduction to set a clear foundation for your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay has a good level of readability, but there are a few areas that need attention:
    - Be cautious of plural vs singular forms, for example, ""number of universities are"" should be ""number of universities is"".
    - Pay attention to capitalization; ""The"" in the middle of sentences should not be capitalized unless it's the start of a sentence or a proper noun.
    - Some sentences could be simplified for clarity, and the essay could benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs to improve the flow.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay begins by agreeing with a statement but also says it considers it useful for the student, which could confuse readers about the exact stance. It's vital to present a personal opinion more clearly and to expand upon it in a dedicated section, preferably towards the end of the essay, to avoid confusion.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments provided are relevant, but they need to be more detailed and supported by more examples or evidence. Each paragraph should contain at least 3 sentences to be considered developed fully. This will strengthen the essay's persuasiveness and ensure that each point is sufficiently explored.

5. **Development of Personal Opinion**: While the essay presents arguments for both sides, it fails to sufficiently expand upon the author's personal opinion. After presenting the background and both sides of the argument, dedicate a paragraph to clearly articulate your own viewpoint, explaining why you hold this opinion with specific reasons and examples.

6. **Paragraph Structure**: Ensure each paragraph, including the introduction and conclusion, has a minimum of three sentences to meet the criteria for a fully developed argument. This will also enhance the essay's clarity and effectiveness.

7. **Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph needs to summarize the main points more robustly and reaffirm the author's stance. It's also crucial that the conclusion addresses both the benefits and the potential challenges discussed in the essay, providing a balanced closing statement.

Many people claim that these countries should not be given any aid from global groups since the authorities misuse it, while others disagree with this idea. However, I believe that countries in the world have to assist them. \n Due to the global improvement, international organizations should provide financial support to poor countries, lack of which may cause the improving speed of the world slower. The benefit of reducing HIV disease of African nations exemplifies this point. After receiving aids, those nations have tackled problems effectively, which leads to decrease the burden on this world and makes humans' lives better. However, assistances cannot achieve the good results as international groups' expectations if politicians in those undeveloped nations use the resources inefficiently \n Most poor nations normally misuse financial aids for the wrong purposes since they do not have the professional ability of resource management. For example, the starvation in Africa is continuing, which cannot help African countries become developing ones. The politicians spend the universal aids on investing in weapons instead of anti-poverty programs. As a result, international groups need to have suitable solutions to minimize this negative effect \n In my opinion, I think whether or not global groups should provide undeveloped countries with financial support depends on the instruction of using that resource. I believe that once knowing these strategies, countries will not waste money on other purposes. Therefore, these groups need to set requirements such as the steps of implementation, the project's target and the expected results besides the assistance. \n In summary, although misspending the fund from poor nations is a negative view of international aid, these countries still need support due to the global development. Therefore, it is necessary to take appropriate measures for this issue.","Okay, you misunderstood the prompt. The topic was about aid that rich countries give the poor countries to help them deal with certain financial situations in their country. There is no indication that international groups in the original prompt. Remember, if it isn't in the original discussion, you should not include it in the restatement or anywhere in your discussion. That leads to a prompt change on your part, which could result in your essay failing the test. Always make sure to use alternative words that still identify the original term. So countries could be identified as nations, region, states, and so on and so forth. When you said global groups, you automatically changed the keyword reference in the essay. Avoid doing that. \n You actually changed the discussion topic throughout the essay because you changed the aid between countries to aid from international organizations. While there are several different prompts that could refer to the discussion you currently present, it does not erase the fact that the discussion never refers to international organizations. It always refers to aid between countries. Country aid examples are : USA sends money to Africa to help with famine, Australia sends financial aid to Nigeria to aid in poverty alleviation, Canada sends financial aid to Mexico to help combat the drug problem. International organization examples are : The UN sends money to the Mongolia to help with their national development, WFP sends money to help feed the poor in Nigeria. WHO sends money to buy Covid 19 test kits in India. See the difference? You cannot interchange countries for international organizations. This essay will miss the mark and get a failing score. All because your reference points do not properly represent the original keywords. \n Let me put it this way; your topic sentence in the first reasoning paragraph is incorrect, but the rest of the reasoning and example points are correct. Rather than international organizations, the reference should have been affluent countries. You have a correct discussion presentation in reasoning paragraph 2. That was relevant to the discussion and well explained. In reasoning paragraph 3, you again missed the topic reference because you said ""global groups"" when you should have said ""well to do countries"". Remember, the discussion is not about global groups, it is about helpful countries. Learn to recognize the difference based on the meaning or representation of the original keyword. \n While you have grammar issues, the transition was not a problem for you this time. The main problem was the misrepresentation of the original discussion. You swapped countries for global groups and that, made huge difference in the discussion presentation, on the negative side. Work on your English comprehension skills. There are exercises available for that online. In order to properly respond to the essay, you must first, make sure you understand all the discussion requirements.","**Final Feedback:**

The essay makes a thoughtful attempt to discuss the topic of international aid. However, there are several key areas that require improvement to ensure the essay fully meets the requirements of the prompt and avoids common pitfalls. 

1. **Understanding and Staying On Topic**: The biggest issue with the essay is a deviation from the original prompt. The prompt asks for a discussion on the aid that rich countries give to poor countries, but the essay shifts focus to aid from international organizations, which is a different subject. To improve, it's crucial to closely read the prompt and ensure that the essay addresses the given topic without changing the scope or keywords. Instead of mentioning ""global groups"" or ""international organizations,"" the focus should be on how individual affluent countries assist poorer nations.

2. **Clarity of the Author's Position**: While your position on international aid is somewhat discernable, making your point of view clearer from the beginning could strengthen the essay. Starting with a direct statement of your opinion before expanding on the reasons and examples can help maintain focus and guide the reader through your argumentation.

3. **Arguments and Support**: You provide examples and arguments supporting the provision of aid, such as the reduction of HIV in African nations. These are good starts, but more specific and relevant examples related to aid between countries (rather than international organizations) would strengthen your case. Also, ensuring that your arguments directly support your viewpoint will make your position more convincing.

4. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammar issues throughout the essay that could be improved with careful proofreading. Paying attention to sentence structure, verb tense, and article usage can enhance the readability and professionalism of your writing. 

5. **Recommendations for Improvement**: 
   - Revisit the essay prompt and adjust the focus of your essay to specifically discuss aid provided by wealthy countries to poorer nations.
   - Be more explicit about your stance on the issue of international aid from the beginning of your essay. A clear thesis statement can serve as a useful guide for the rest of your composition.
   - Include more detailed examples that directly relate to the aid provided by countries, and ensure these examples directly support your arguments.
   - Work on refining grammar and style. Consider utilizing online resources or software to check for and correct common errors.

Overall, your essay demonstrates a good effort to tackle a complex issue. With increased attention to the essay prompt, greater clarity in your position and arguments, and improvements in grammar and style, your writing will undoubtedly become more persuasive and impactful.

However, there are several areas where improvements could enhance clarity, adherence to the prompt, and overall effectiveness. Let's delve into the specifics to help refine your essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay somewhat addresses the topic by mentioning advantages and disadvantages of living in rural areas. However, the essay prompt likely expects a balanced discussion on a given issue without a directive to choose a side. Make sure your introduction outlines the specific advantages and disadvantages you will discuss to directly answer the essay question. It's important to stay neutral and discuss each point without showing a preference unless the prompt specifically asks for your opinion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases that disrupt the flow of your essay. For instance, ""Nowadays, people tend to choose big cities to live in is gradually become popularity"" could be revised to ""Living in big cities is becoming increasingly popular nowadays."" Pay attention to verb tenses and ensure sentence structures are clear and correct. Break long sentences into shorter ones to improve readability and avoid confusion.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: While you have shared your perspective, especially in the conclusion, the essay prompt does not seem to ask for a personal viewpoint. It's crucial in such essays to present information and analysis without concluding with a personal stance unless it's explicitly requested. Focus on providing a balanced discussion based on the essay's requirements.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You've identified clear benefits and drawbacks to living in rural areas. However, the arguments could be more impactful if directly compared or connected to how they mirror or contrast with living in big cities. Ensure you're discussing the same points from different perspectives to maintain a cohesive and coherent argument throughout. Instead of jumping to solutions or personal preferences, keep your focus on describing and analyzing these aspects neutrally.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should summarize the main points discussed without introducing new ideas or solutions, especially if the prompt doesn't ask for them. Aim to restate the advantages and disadvantages mentioned previously, reinforcing the essay's neutral stance on the topic.

6. **General Advice**: To make your essay more compelling, use varied sentence structures and include specific examples where possible to support your points. Also, checking your essay for common grammatical mistakes, such as subject-verb agreement and proper use of articles, can significantly improve its readability.

By addressing these areas, your essay would not only adhere more closely to the prompt but also present a clearer, more balanced discussion that is easier to follow. Remember, effectively communicating your analysis and findings is key to a successful essay.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

If we can speak another language that isn't our mother tongue, we can earn a better salary and be promoted to higher positions compared to others who have the same academic background. Some recruiters favor candidates who are bilingual or multilingual over those who are monolingual, which is popular in multinational corporations. Apart from working, traveling is partly why we should learn a foreign language. Namely, we can explore other countries and immerse ourselves in a new culture through speaking to local people or joining local activities without encountering language barriers. \n I truly believe that studying a new language begins with more than two factors. It is clear to all that the young generation is serious about studying a foreign language that serves their academics well, such as getting an international degree or gaining knowledge by reading materials in English or another language. The aim of learning a language is to maintain our relationships. If our lovers or friends are foreigners, we might struggle with at least some degree of miscommunication in case we don't speak the language well. Therefore, learning their language is necessary and allows us to have a deep insight into their culture and then effectively build relationships. \n In conclusion, I think that various compelling reasons push us to learn a new language, and this depends on our needs and favorites. No doubt, speaking a new language gives us more opportunities in our lives.","There are 3 points of view that should be present in the first paragraph. The first public opinion and the second public opinion must be restated across 2 sentences. Then, the writer's opinion comes in as the 3rd sentence, with the thesis statement attached. This presentation is missing one public opinion presentation. That means the prompt restatement is incomplete. It will not receive full points for that paragraph. \n The reasoning paragraphs cover only the writer's opinion. That is the incorrect response format. This should be a 3 reasoning paragraph statement that explains both public opinions in individual paragraphs, with the writer's opinion stated and explained as the last or 3rd reasoning paragraph. The summary conclusion does not properly restate the given topic and various reasons either. I am afraid this essay will not get a passing score in an actual setting.","Upon reviewing the essay, I would like to offer several points of feedback that can help enhance its structure, clarity, and overall effectiveness in addressing the given topic. Your essay has some strengths, including clear points on why learning a foreign language is beneficial, not just for travail and work but for other significant reasons. However, there are areas for improvement to meet the essay requirements fully and convey your arguments more effectively.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay begins by disagreeing with the notion that the only motivation for learning a foreign language includes traveling or working abroad. However, it's essential to present both sides of the argument before stating your position. A balanced introduction would include a brief exposition of the common reasons people might choose to learn foreign languages, followed by your argument that there are indeed more reasons than the commonly thought two.

2. **Essay Structure and Argument Clarity:** Your essay's structure could be improved to better match expected standards. Typically, an effective essay will present a clear restatement of the public opinions on the topic in the first paragraph, followed by your own viewpoint as part of the thesis statement. Each of the following paragraphs should explore these viewpoints in detail, ideally dedicating one paragraph to a public opinion and another to contrasting or supporting points from another public perspective, before concluding with your viewpoint as the final piece of analysis. This approach ensures a balanced discussion and a coherent, persuasive argument. Your current structure merges all opinions into a single narrative, which might confuse readers on the specific points being argued.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Overall, your essay demonstrates a good command of language, with minor issues that don't significantly detract from readability. However, attention to detail, such as consistent tense usage and more varied sentence structures, could enhance the overall flow and readability of your essay. Consider revising sentences that feel too long or complicated, breaking them down for clarity and impact. Proofreading for minor grammatical errors will also polish your final submission.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Evidence:** You've done well to include descriptive arguments supporting your viewpoint. For instance, mentioning the benefits of learning a foreign language for career advancement and personal relationships adds depth to your argument. Yet, there is room to elaborate further by including examples, statistics, or studies that back up your points. Doing so would strengthen your position and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

5. **Conclusion:** While your conclusion touches upon the main ideas of your essay, it could be improved by more explicitly restating the topic and summarizing the various reasons you've discussed. This recap will reinforce your standpoint and ensure the reader is left with a clear understanding of your argument.

In summary, while your essay presents a valuable perspective on the importance of learning foreign languages for more than just travel and work, refining its structure, ensuring a balanced argument presentation, and enhancing clarity through careful editing will significantly improve its effectiveness and impact.",4,4,4,4,2,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4731,https://essayforum.com/writing/books-online-platforms-traditional-paper-93630/,dev,"Books on online platforms or traditional, paper books (ielts essay)","With the advent of technology, almost everything these days is available online including books. It is stated that paper editions will no longer be in anyone's interest assuming that people will have free access to any reading source in the future. From my perspective, although online papers do wonders to the reading market, I firmly believe that there are several unique features of paper books that cannot be replaced. \n On the one hand, the emergence of e-books or any sorts of online reading saves a great deal of time, space and money to read. To commence with, when read online, no cost is required for paper production, manufacturing and delivery services. Therefore, reading online helps save readers' money for these processes, not to mention the effects towards the environment by not exploiting wood and using fossil fuels for production and shipping. Another rationale proving that reading online is a great invention is that people can literally read almost anywhere they want owing to the portable size of technological devices used for online reading. Instead of carrying kilograms of paper books or magazines to schools, libraries and so on, online readers can update the news or read their unfinished novel on their screens. This enables them to read even on the bus, train or in the park without having to carry a thousand-page book in their hands. \n On the other hand, great as online reading may be, printed editions cannot be altered due to the sense it brings to a great many people and its impacts on human's vision compared to online reading. The first key factor is that a multitude of readers prefer buying books not only because they collect the pieces they have read for fun or that they want to see their progress but they also enjoy the paper's smell and the realistic feel of touching the books. To exemplify, a great many people find it harder to concentrate on reading online since they are not used to scrolling the screen to keep track of their reading as well as that they prefer the woody scent of paper, which excites them whenever they purchase a new book. Moreover, for some people, blue lights from screens can make their eyes tired more quickly than when they use paper, resulting in common eye diseases such as short-sighted or dry eyes. \n To encapsulate, although reading on online platforms is beneficial in some ways, paper books still have irreplaceable impact on many readers.","The essay properly responded to the discussion question. It created a very strong restatement and personal opinion. The personal opinion is based strongly on the writer's discussion ideas that the examiner would have expected to read about in the discussion paragraphs. However, the writer failed to defend his opinion based on measured responses in the discussion format. The strong single opinion train was derailed by the comaparative discussion presentation that succeeded it. \n Now, a comparative discussion would have been a great way to discuss this essay if the presentation paragraph worked hard to use the opposing reason to strengthen the writer's opinion. For instance. He could have said: \n While I agree that... I have to strongly disagree with this belief to the extent that.... \n In addition, when people say... they fail to consider... Hence I solidly disapprove of this point of view because.... \n By using the aforementioned manner, a proper measured response discussion is presented. The important aspect of this discussion is to disprove a public opinion that the writer agrees with, but not totally for some reason. That way the essay single opinion based and supportive of the thesis opinion / statement. \n He seems to have also forgotten that the summary conclusion needs to be represented in at least 2 sentences. The current presentation does not meet the correct reverse paraphrase requirements for the conclusion. So it will not help his TA score in the end.","This essay effectively addresses the topic by presenting a balanced view on the advantages of online reading and the unique values of paper books. The stance is clearly in favor of paper books, offering a variety of reasons for this preference, which shows a strong personal opinion and restatement of the discussion's main points. In improving this essay, further detail could focus on reinforcing the author's position through a more structured comparative discussion.

To enhance the essay, consider adopting a structure that strengthens the argument by directly contrasting the points about online reading with the perceived benefits of paper books. For example, acknowledging the conveniences of online reading but highlighting why and how these do not surpass the merits of paper books could create a more compelling argument. Statements like ""While the accessibility of online reading is undeniable, the tactile and emotional connection to paper books offers a more immersive reading experience that digital platforms cannot replicate"" could serve to underline the essay's main argument more forcefully.

Additionally, spelling and grammar are generally good, but watch for minor errors and ensure sentences flow smoothly. Paying attention to stylistic elements, such as sentence structure and variety, will make the text more engaging.

The conclusion of the essay would benefit from a more detailed summarization that encapsulates both the recognition of online reading’s advantages and the irreplaceable value of paper books, thus ensuring a stronger, more impactful closing argument. A two-sentence minimum in the conclusion that paraphrases the thesis and main arguments could more effectively summarize the discussion and solidify the author's stance.

By addressing these areas—structuring the comparative discussion more strategically, refining stylistic elements, and strengthening the conclusion—the essay can become more persuasive and coherent, offering a well-rounded discussion that is both informative and reflective of the author's clear viewpoint.",4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

There are two main reasons why I believe that arts are very useful in not only school but also daily life. \n First of all, studying arts at school can help children to enhance their imagination and creativity. When children learn arts, they are free to express their own perspectives and interpretation of their own lives. This will help them think more flexibly and creatively. Additionally, due to the daily observation of objects during drawing, the child's brain will be boosted by the ability to observe and enhance memory, thereby nurturing the imagination. \n Secondly, stress reduction is also a reason why arts should be made compulsory at school. Decades of studies have suggested that learning arts can help learners to be more relaxed. Moreover, art also helps children more in love with life when they see life through the eyes of the artist and let their souls into the painting. \n Thirdly, arts make our life more vivid. Learning arts can make our life more vibrant. When learning arts, we can gain new friends and relationships. And if you are a bit talented in art, you will be admired by a lot of people. Finishing a portrait or a landscape and use it as furniture in your house can make your life more light and full of spirit. \n In summary, I think that arts should be introduced as a compulsory subject at school","<quotation>There are two main reasons why I believe that arts are very useful in not only school but also daily life.</quotation> \n The formatting of this sentence should have been divided into 2. Rather than saying there are 2 main reasons, present the reasons individually in a manner that provides an overview of the topics within the school and personal settings. Such a presentation would have added clarity and coherence to the succeeding paragraphs. That said, I must commend the writer for the creative prompt restatement. \n Do not go beyond 2 reasons.The prompt isa standard 4 paragraph presentation, with a 2 paragraph reasoning allotment. It is the entry of the 3rd reason, which could have been easily merged with the second paragraph that led to the under discussed second paragraph. Without this error ,the essay would have been in a better place for a higher score since the essay only has negligible errors. \n P.S. Aim for a 2 sentence conclusion as required next time.","Your essay strongly supports the idea that arts should be a mandatory part of the school curriculum, which clearly aligns with the assigned topic. You effectively communicate your viewpoint and provide compelling arguments to support your stance. Your introduction does a good job of stating your opinion, and your conclusion succinctly wraps up your main points. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and adherence to essay structure guidelines commonly expected in English proficiency tests.

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: When introducing your reasons for supporting compulsory arts education, try to present each reason separately for clearer understanding. Instead of stating, ""There are two main reasons why I believe that arts are very useful in not only school but also daily life,"" consider providing a brief overview of each reason in its separate sentence. This will help guide the reader through your essay more smoothly and make your arguments easier to follow.

2. **Essay Structure**: Your essay structure would benefit from sticking to the conventional format of introducing two main reasons when prompted and exploring these within the subsequent paragraphs. By mentioning a ""thirdly"" in your essay, you introduce a third reason which could have been integrated with your second reason on stress reduction for a more focused discussion. Remember, maintaining a structured approach helps in keeping your essay organized and makes your arguments more potent.

3. **Conclusion**: While conciseness in a conclusion is key, a two-sentence closing could enhance the impact of your essay by succinctly summarizing your main points and restating your stance. It serves as the final opportunity to leave a lasting impression on your reader.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Your essay is largely free from significant errors in spelling and grammar, which is commendable. However, paying close attention to the specifics of punctuation and word choice can help polish your writing further. For instance, careful use of commas and transitions would improve the flow between your ideas.

By focusing on these areas, you can refine your essay to more effectively communicate your thoughts and present a well-structured argument. Your enthusiasm for the arts and the profound understanding of its benefits in education and personal development shines through your writing, which is a great strength. Keep up the good work, and with some adjustments to the structure and clarity, your essays will become even more impactful.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

Essay Academic IELTS,"While internet should be the only platform to start learning activity due to its feature attracting students to learn enthusiastically, others believe that learning words through printed books might be better as to save children health from online device radiation. \n The object animation of Internet might be considered as the beneficial factor to attract children to learn words. That is to say that children would be excited, thus focusing more on understanding the alphabet, when they see the alphabet being presented by moving cartoon in Internet. A piece of research by English Literature Students in Indonesia University in 2019 stated that cartoon body gesture in YouTube video captured children attention, hence, making them more active to respond the video by repeating the words. As a result, it enhanced their learning memory towards the words. I believe that such online learning platform could lead children to learn the words faster due to these attractive animations. \n By contrast, learning to read words through printed books might keep serious harm to the children health. That is to say that children would not be exposed to any potential radiation from online screen, when they spend more time to learn many letters in printed books. Eventually, eye fatigue caused by radiation in Internet could be prevented to harm children eyes. In 2019, some research by public health students in Harvard university suggested that the absence of radiation from printed materials might sustain individuals good visibility, thereby making them able to concentrate on their materials. I think that learning through printed materials which preserves the health of children, thereby enabling them to concentrate on their next lessons outweighs the benefit of online animated objects. \n In summary, the moving objects in online reading might result into having more children to be active in that platform, while learning through printed materials could not risk children to poor sight because of radiation posed by online screen, thereby making children to still have more capacity in learning other materials.","You do know that this type of discussion is always presented as a 3 paragraph essay right? Your format is totally incorrect. You focused solely on your personal point of view in the presentation. You have not properly formatted the discussion paragraphs which should have clearly explained: \n - the public belief in children learning through printed reading material and why \n - the public belief in the internet based reading and why it is more effective \n - Your personal belief as to the best way to teach children to read \n By the way, you can make up information based on your personal experience and knowledge in any IELTS essay. However, you must not frame it in the form of a researched presentation. Do not use references to any information you present. Always use a personal point of view. You could have simply said that ""my younger brother enjoyed learning how to read using animated YouTube cartoons instead of the picture books our parents used to teach him how to read"", or something like that. \n The essay fails to provide the comparative point of view for the 2 public opinions prior to your personal point of view. It comes across as a totally personal opinion paper instead. You must use group pronouns to refer to the public opinion and then, use the personal pronouns throughout your personal point of view explanation. That way you clearly format the discussion as per the discussion instructions of the prompt. Use only the topics presented in the original, but you can use general reasons for the explanation. Just avoid the reference to research materials, that is never used in Task 2 essays. \n Your explanations are too wordy in a confusing manner. Try to present a clarity of thought in your discussion paragraphs. Do not use so much unnatural feeling vocabulary that the examiner will see that you are only focused on the LR section of the presentation.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to strengthen your argument and align your essay more closely with expectations for English proficiency test essays. Let's delve into the areas of focus you requested feedback on, and include the additional points highlighted:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay engages with the topic by discussing two methods of learning for children: internet platforms versus printed books. However, the structure of your essay does not align with the typical format expected in such discussions. Essays of this nature generally benefit from a three-paragraph structure where each paragraph addresses a specific point of view: the public’s opinion on printed materials, the public’s opinion on internet-based learning, and finally, your own personal perspective. This structure was missing from your essay, making it seem predominantly like an expression of your personal point of view rather than a balanced discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: Your essay generally uses correct grammar and spelling. However, the language and vocabulary can at times be unnecessarily complex or wordy, which may confuse rather than clarify your points. It's best to aim for clear, straightforward language that conveys your ideas effectively. Remember, simplicity and clarity often lead to stronger, more coherent essays than complexity and excessive wordiness.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is evident throughout the essay; you clearly advocate for learning through internet platforms based on their engaging features. However, to improve, it would be beneficial to present a more balanced view including public opinions on both sides before articulating your personal stance. This approach ensures that your essay comprehensively addresses the topic from multiple perspectives, not just your own.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: While you provide arguments in favor of learning through the internet, citing animation as an engaging feature, your essay would benefit from a more balanced discussion. For instance, discussing the advantages of printed books beyond just the absence of screen radiation—such as tactile engagement or the ability to focus without digital distractions—would offer a fuller comparison. Additionally, avoid discussing topics not directly related to the prompt, such as health issues associated with screen time, unless they are directly relevant to the learning outcomes being discussed.

To strengthen your essay, consider restructuring it to include a clearer comparison of public opinions on internet-based learning and traditional reading materials, followed by your personal viewpoint. Use specific, personal examples to illustrate your points rather than referring to research or studies, which are less suitable for this type of essay. Focus on clarity and simplicity in your writing to ensure your arguments are easily understood. Lastly, ensure your discussion stays on topic and directly addresses the pros and cons related to learning outcomes, not peripheral issues.

By focusing on these areas, your essay will become more aligned with the expectations for English proficiency tests and present a well-rounded, clearly articulated argument on the learning platforms for children.",4,3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

For example, since young people should make an outline of to do list for the next week, they not only may avoid feeling overwhelming from an enormous of information in class but also do not make confusion of assignments. Moreover, time management has separated efficiently studying time and time for extracurricular activities for students. Due to diligent and discipline personality of students, they may be successful in college. \n Additionally, choosing accurately a study attitude also play an important role which leads to completely conquer good results to come.

The thesis statement effectively introduces this argument, showcasing a good understanding of the essay prompt. However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to strengthen the essay.

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The essay sometimes struggles with sentence formation and word choice, making it challenging to follow the argument. To improve, try simplifying sentences. Aim for clear and concise language rather than complex sentence structures. This approach will help communicate ideas more effectively. For instance, instead of saying ""It means that planning time and setting their personal activities clearly are good ways to help them getting successful in college,"" consider ""Planning and organizing activities clearly can help students succeed in college.""

2. **Grammar and Style**: There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay. Paying attention to grammar rules and sentence structure can greatly improve readability. For example, ""Many young people often asked themselves that how to achieve their aims"" should be corrected to ""Many young people often ask themselves how to achieve their goals."" Additionally, work on using articles (a, an, the) correctly and ensure verb tense consistency.

3. **Supporting Arguments**: While the essay mentions important factors like time management and study habits, the arguments would benefit from more specific examples and explanations. Show how these factors directly impact success in college through personal anecdotes or cited research. Instead of broadly stating their importance, detail how and why they contribute to a student's academic achievement.

4. **Point of View**: The point of view is mostly clear, but the message could be strengthened by directly addressing the reader or using a more personal tone when sharing advice. This will make the essay more engaging and persuasive.

5. **Thesis and Topic Sentences**: The thesis statement is a strong part of the essay, but make sure each paragraph also starts with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. This will help organize the essay and make it easier for the reader to follow the argument.

While some people believe that the prevalence makes it no longer effective, I side with those who support the idea that advertisements still play an important role in the way we purchase products. \n On the one hand, some people hold the view that advertising is so pervasive that they tend to ignore. People are often bombarded with multitude of pop-up ads and banners whenever using social media or handed with countless promotion flyers on the streets. Consequently, this practice has resulted in negative attitude towards advertisements of a part of society. Furthermore, those who irritated would then be prone to skip the displayed ads or use Adblock tools to avoid all commercials. Personally, I sometimes annoyed about the ad breaks while enjoying my favorite television shows. Therefore, commercials should be reasonably placed in order to improve experience of some viewers. \n On the other hand, it is widely believed that advertising remains its indispensable position in retail activities. First, throughout creative and viral advertising campaigns, business companies could raise the brand awareness and easily launch new products to potential customers. Take this following sausage company as a case in point. During prime time viewing, they showed a TV commercial of their goods. Also, the promoted sausages appeared with a high density, special visual effects and catchy music that stuck out in viewers' mind and gradually made them incline to purchase. In addition, many companies advertise things in terms of clients' emotion. There are mass of tailor-made ads consist of stories, slogans exploiting people' desires, fears and anxieties. Undoubtedly, those companies would gain benefits from the convinced customers. As a result, advertising in many forms influence the way we buy things. \n Inclusion, opinion is divisive but from my perspective, although there are some try to avoid frequently appeared commercials, advertising should be sustained and improved in the future.","This is a single opinion essay based on the question ;"" Which side do you agree with?"" Based on your I response, you appear to understand the point of the discussion and have an opinion about it. It is just too bad that you failed to deliver a clear topic paraphase.

The writing instruction doesn't inclicate a need to ""discuss both points of new"" so that should not be done. Instead, 2 discussion reasons, developed over 2 paragraphs should have been provided. As a result, this presentation has only I scurable paragraph in relation to the writer's opinion. It may not be enough to result in a passing score as the supporting reasons are not completely presented.","The essay provides an overview of opinions regarding the role and impact of advertising in modern society. It correctly identifies two sides of the argument concerning advertising's effectiveness and ubiquity. However, to create a more effective and persuasive essay, consider the following feedback incorporating key points for improvement:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to respond to the debate around advertising, indicating a preference for the positive impacts of advertising. However, it fails to clearly state a thesis statement or paraphrase the topic effectively in the introduction. It’s important to start with a clear statement that outlines your position or viewpoint directly related to the question. This helps in setting a focused direction for the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow of reading. For example, phrases like ""people hold the view that advertising is so pervasive that they tend to ignore"" could be rephrased for clarity, such as ""some individuals believe advertising has become so widespread that it often gets ignored."" Additionally, pay attention to tense consistency and article usage (""a multitude of pop-up ads"", not ""multitude of pop-up ads""). Enhancing these aspects can significantly improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Although you express a personal stance on the importance of advertising, the comparison format dilutes the strength of your viewpoint. Since the task calls for a single opinion essay, focus on elaborating why you support your perspective with two developed reasons, each in its own paragraph. This approach will clarify your point of view and make your argument stronger.

4. **Descriptive and Supportive Arguments**: The essay provides examples, like the sausage company advertisement, which is good. However, the arguments could be more developed and focused. Instead of briefly mentioning several points, choose two key reasons that support your viewpoint and expand on them with detailed examples and explanations. Avoid discussing the opposing viewpoint in depth since the prompt asks for your opinion.

5. **Conclusion**: The essay ends with “Inclusion,” which seems to be a typo for “In conclusion.” The conclusion itself is somewhat weak and does not effectively summarise the main points or reinforce the stance taken. A stronger conclusion would clearly restate the viewpoint, summarise the key reasons supporting that view, and potentially offer a final thought or call to action.

In summary, focusing on providing a clear stance, developing your arguments more thoroughly across separate paragraphs, and addressing grammatical and stylistic issues can significantly improve your essay. Simplifying language and directly addressing the essay prompt will make your writing more coherent and persuasive.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, to enhance the essay and align it more effectively with the requirements of an IELTS Task 2 essay, several areas need improvement.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay does respond to the topic but lacks depth in its argument. Since the prompt asks ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?"", it's vital to clearly state the extent of agreement or disagreement at the beginning. Responses like ""I can agree"" are too vague. Instead, opt for a definitive stance, such as ""I strongly agree because..."" This approach requires you to commit to a position and defend it throughout your essay. 

2. **Word Count**: The essay is under the minimum required word count of 250 words. It’s important to meet or slightly exceed this requirement to avoid penalties. If writing complex sentences is challenging, it's acceptable to construct simple yet effective sentences that convey your argument fully.

3. **Structure and Clarity**: Focusing on a single opinion rather than presenting conflicting viewpoints within the same essay will enhance clarity and coherence. Develop two solid reasons that back your stance and explore these fully in separate paragraphs. This structured approach simplifies your argument and aids in creating a coherent essay.

4. **Concluding Paragraph**: The concluding paragraph should succinctly summarize the essay's argument and ideally consist of at least three sentences. Reflect on the main discussion points and reiterate your standpoint, ensuring the essay feels conclusively finished rather than open-ended.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay presents several stylistic and grammatical errors that could disrupt readability. For example, the lack of spaces after commas and misuse of conjunctions can hinder the clear flow of ideas. Consider revising the essay with basic grammar rules in mind and aim for clear, simple sentences to express ideas more effectively.

6. **Arguments and Examples**: The essay brings up valuable points but often lacks detailed examples and explanations to support the arguments fully. Including specific examples, like the mention of the cousin's hobby, strengthens your essay. Expanding on these with more detail will make your arguments more convincing.

In conclusion, ensure your essay clearly aligns with the task by taking a definite stance on the topic, improving structural coherence, addressing the required word count, and refining grammar and style for better clarity. Enhancing these areas will significantly increase the strength of your essay.",3,3,2,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Discussion

It is true the number of digital games on early ages has increased and more users accessed personal computers. Overall, this essay will point out the benefits and drawbacks to playing games and provide suggestion that might mitigate this issue. \n First and foremost, there are clearly a great improvement cognitive skills developed by game players. Tablets and devices will teach youngsters how be a quick thinker. For instance, if a child was educated with plenty of information, internet, technologies and artificial intelligence through games he or she would likely learn any major faster rather than those do not. However, drawbacks come across such lack of physical activity, far less social relationship and even worst the extremely exposition and vulnerability. Instead pupils should be educated on a safe environment. \n The key factor could tackle this issue is probably the most commonly in our society, as broaden information about length on computer have already been discusses. How long should be allowed children playing games daily? Since that the kid goes to school, play sports and have friends with any lack of essential needs, parents usually allow them around one hour per day. Moreover the most crucial point should be balance their entertainment and daily basis. \n In conclusion, although digital games brought cognitive development, it is dangerous on social behaviour and daily routine. However, a limited time in front of computers can diminish those problems.","Dear student, this being a 5 paragraph comparative essay needs to be better threshed out than the way that you currently have it. You have written about the advantage and disadvantage in a single paragraph with multiple discussion points indicated. Don't lose focus of the main C&C requirement which is that a paragraph needs to have one topic sentence at the start and supporting sentences following it. \n The main problem that you have is that you are not focusing on trying to explain yourself in this essay. My guess is that you have been watching the clock too much to make sure that you do not go overtime. That is why your sentences are scattered and little developed. You do not have to watch the clock if you just remember to write 1 topic sentence and 4 sentences after that. A total of 5 sentences. One you write 5 lines / sentences you can consider it a complete paragraph and move on to the next one. Don't forget to use the transition sentence at the end of the paragraph to introduce the next topic and paragraph. The way you can best remember this is probably in this equation: \n 5 sentences + 5 paragraphs = time to edit \n Editing of the paper is very important. It helps you to clarify your thought process and presentation and also gives you the chance to correct any errors in sentence development, structure, and spelling.","The essay provides an interesting discussion on the impact of playing computer games in childhood, touching on both the benefits and drawbacks. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make the essay stronger and more focused.

1. **Structure and Organization**: The current format mixes advantages and disadvantages within the same paragraph, which may confuse readers. A more effective approach would be to dedicate one paragraph to advantages and another to disadvantages. Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that indicates whether you're discussing benefits or drawbacks. Then, support this topic sentence with 4 more sentences exploring this idea in-depth. This structure will help in maintaining focus and developing your arguments more thoroughly.

2. **Development of Ideas**: It seems that more attention to developing each point would be beneficial. Instead of briefly mentioning many ideas, choose a few and explore them with examples and explanations. This depth will make your arguments more convincing and your essay more informative. It's better to fully develop fewer points than to touch on many without much development.

3. **Clarity and Precision**: Work on making your sentences clearer. Some sentences are a bit confusing or awkwardly constructed, which might make it hard for readers to understand your point. Simplifying your language and sentence structure will help immensely. Remember, the goal is to communicate your ideas as clearly and precisely as possible.

4. **Proofreading and Editing**: It appears that the essay was written in haste, which might have led to some errors and unclear expressions. After finishing your writing, always allocate time for editing. This process is vital as it allows you to refine your ideas, improve sentence structure, and correct any spelling or grammatical errors. As suggested, think of your essay in terms of equation: ""5 sentences + 5 paragraphs = time to edit."" This means after constructing five sentences for a complete paragraph, and after drafting five paragraphs, focus on revising and enhancing your essay.

5. **Paragraph Transitions**: To improve the flow of your essay, incorporate transition sentences at the end of each paragraph. These sentences will serve as bridges between paragraphs, guiding the reader smoothly from one idea to the next. This technique not only improves readability but also strengthens the coherence of your essay.

6. **Point of View and Argumentation**: While your essay attempts to present both sides of the argument, it would be more persuasive if it clarified your stance on the topic. Are you more in favor of the benefits or the drawbacks? Making your viewpoint clear will strengthen your argument and provide a solid foundation for your discussion.

In summary, focusing on structuring your essay with clear, well-developed paragraphs, dedicating time to edit and refine your writing, and making your point of view explicit will greatly enhance your essay. These improvements will not only make your arguments more compelling but also easier for your readers to follow and understand.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

To my viewpoint, I take issue on this opinion. \n News have variety of benefit on people's life. First of all, it informs people about the social issues that could affect their lives. With awareness of the current state of affair, news readers can be provided with knowledge as well as solution for the issue. For example, during the outbreak of a disease, people who stay up to date with the medical news would be conscious of preventive measures to avoid being infected. In addition, watching and reading news would be conducive to citizens' consciousness of laws. Frequently reading to articles, every member of the society can understand policies more clearly and then they would behave morally and legally. \n The absence of news in daily lives can result in some repercussions. Firstly, people who are unaware of social issues might live an isolated life with few relationships as they have almost no connection with the society. Moreover, they would be kept in ignorance of essential skill and information. For instance, if people neglect reports about traffic, possibly they can get involved in traffic violations and accidents. \n In conclusion, I must reaffirm that people should pay attention to the news to stay informed and alert to significant events.","I take i that you are self-studying for the IELTS test? I believe that this is the case because you did not know about the minimum word requirement for the Task 2 essay. You are required to write no less than 250 words, but no more than 290 words. When I checked the word count for your essay, it appears that you wrote only 224 words. That is way under the word count. You are short by 26 words. Which means you will receive a sizeable percentage deduction for your work. \n So aside from the low word count, you also have certain grammar errors in the essay that will also reduce your per criteria scoring. That means, the essay will not be able to achieve a passing band score. \n You did not provide the complete prompt for this essay. Had you provided a proper 3-5 sentence paraphrase of the original discussion in the first paragraph, I would have been able to present a better review of your work. Since you did not provide a complete restatement, you will receive an even further reduced TA score. The same problem exists in your concluding paragraph. \n Your reasoning paragraphs also need to be developed further in terms of discussion reasons, supporting examples, and additional considerations. The essay is really poorly developed. It is not worthy of a passing score at this point. There are too many failures in your presentation for the essay to be considered for even a passing mark. The math, based on errors, just don't add up to a passing score.","Your essay on the significance of news in our lives makes several compelling points. However, there are areas for improvement to align it more closely with English proficiency test standards, specifically for IELTS Task 2 essays.

1. **Response to Topic**:
Your essay addresses the topic, asserting the importance of staying informed through news. This stance is clear, but your essay would benefit from a stronger introduction. A more detailed paraphrase of the discussion question could set a solid foundation for your argument. Similarly, your conclusion would stand stronger with a summary that echoes the main points and your stance effectively.

2. **Word Count**:
It's crucial to meet the minimum word requirement for Task 2 essays, which is 250 words. Your essay falls short, with only 224 words. This shortfall could significantly impact your score. Expanding your essay with more detailed examples, explanations, and possibly an additional argument, would not only enrich your essay but also meet the necessary word count.

3. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues**:
There are minor grammar mistakes within your essay. For instance, ""news are"" should be ""news is,"" since ""news"" is considered a singular noun. Keeping an eye on subject-verb agreement will improve the overall quality of your writing. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to enhance readability and engagement.

4. **Clarity and Argumentation**:
Your point of view is clear, yet your arguments could be more developed. Each point you make needs to be backed by more specific examples and deeper analysis. This depth will help clarify your position and make your argument more persuasive. For example, when discussing the role of news in spreading awareness about diseases or legal consciousness, more specific scenarios or data could make these points more convincing.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
Remember, proficiency tests like IELTS have specific criteria for scoring essays. Failing to meet these (such as the word count and providing a complete argument) can severely impact your score. Aim to fully develop your reasoning with expanded discussion, relevant examples, and consider the implications or counterarguments to your points to add depth to your essay.

Enhancing your essay based on these critiques will make your writing stronger and more aligned with the expectations of an English proficiency test.

If in the past, we were used to small outlets, in this day and age, extensive areas to go shopping are much more prevalent. Taking it into consideration, I will point out two main benefits and one major disadvantage of an issue that is citizens are tend to shop in bigger shopping centers rather than mini traditional ones. \n To commence with, it is indisputable that consumers get safety in purchasing and selecting what they need. Because every product sold in supermarket has its own label with obvious sources, buyers will not feel too worried or afraid of fake goods. Quality of commodities is always a big concern of managers. It is a main factor to make up the trust and keep customers beside diverse and mutitudinous thing. One side that can not forget to mention is cost, the price is fixed and depends on manufacturers, hence, purchases in trade hubs do not need to bargain and have to pay the exact expense. \n Another merit of shopping in broader department stores instead of corner shops is some preferential treatments that shoppers are given. It is an intelligent way to attract and assure a number of customers. Provided that you usually go shopping in this center, assistant can present you a member card with special offers, for example, you buy one skirt, then you will be given another. Furthermore, discount events and giveaway are often held, so if you want to join and give it a try to know how you are lucky, you are welcomed. \n Nevertheless, everything has two sides. Taken a look at drawbacks, larger shopping centers are somewhat inconvenient in several aspects. For instance, when you bought a T-shirt but after dressing up at home, it is too tight for you, you really want to take it back and change another one, unfortunately, it can not be accepted in supermarket. Whereas, you find it much easier to own what you want while buying in a smaller outlet as the trader is more flexible to you. In addtion, the outstanding advantage of corner shop lies in diversification of good choices of a particular range of products. It is specialized in machines or comestics, and so on with competitive cost, so you can take it into acoount and decide what to purchase carefully. Many small outlets, unquestionably, are located in narrow cormer and you may go to there every time. By contrast, shopping hubs are on big streets, this prevents you from buying when being on the go because they are too far from your apartment. \n In conclusion, the appearance along with the remarkable development of more extensive shopping areas, and malls is also proved the prosperity of a city, thus, it is a positive tendency and authority should concern it more in order to filfil some shortcomings and improve exceptional strengths.","Cu, your essay is not clearly focused on the discussion. The location being discussed is a shopping mall, not a supermarket. A supermarket may be located in a shopping mall, but the function of a supermarket is far different from that of a shopping mall. The essay is asking you to focus on the shopping mall stores, not the supermarket. The way that you interchange the terms successively in the essay creates confusion and stress for the reader as the explanation that you offer becomes difficult to understand. The overall presentation is actually hard to follow because your discussions lack a cohesive and coherent flow. It appears that you need to practice writing simple and understandable English sentences before you can launch into essay practice tests. If this essay is a reflection of your writing skills, along with reasoning and logic, then you are not quite ready to take the test yet. You have a long way to go and should focus on first, improving your grammar and sentence development skills.","The essay touches upon the comparison between shopping at larger shopping areas and traditional smaller outlets, presenting both the advantages and disadvantages of the latter. While the effort to address both sides of the argument is commendable, there are significant areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, focus, and effectiveness of the essay.

Firstly, it's important to maintain a clear focus on the specific topic at hand. The essay often interchanges terms like ""supermarkets,"" ""malls,"" and ""department stores,"" which can lead to confusion. Each of these shopping venues serves different purposes and offers different experiences to consumers. Clarifying and consistently sticking to one type of shopping venue, in this case, shopping malls, would help make the essay more coherent and focused.

Secondly, the essay faces challenges with spelling, grammar, and sentence structure, which impacts its overall readability and clarity. It's beneficial to practice writing simple, clear, and grammatically correct sentences. This will not only enhance understanding but also ensure the essay flows more smoothly from one point to the next. For instance, phrases like ""citizens are tend to shop"" ought to be corrected to ""citizens tend to shop,"" and ""mutitudinous thing"" could be clarified or revised for better understanding.

The viewpoint of the essay's author is somewhat clear, as it attempts to explore both benefits and drawbacks of shopping at larger centers versus smaller outlets. However, this point of view could be made clearer by explicitly stating the thesis at the beginning and ensuring that each paragraph consistently supports this viewpoint with clear and descriptive arguments.

Thirdly, while the essay tries to address the advantages and disadvantages of shopping in larger malls compared to smaller shops, the arguments presented could be more vivid and organized. Each point would benefit from being developed in its own paragraph with specific examples and clear reasoning to support the essay's main thesis. For example, when discussing the positive aspects of shopping in larger venues, it would help to delve deeper into how these benefit the consumer beyond just mentioning safety and preferential treatment. Likewise, the disadvantages section would stand out more by offering more concrete examples or statistics to back up the points made.

In summary, focusing on one type of shopping venue for clarity, improving grammatical accuracy and sentence structure for coherence, clearly stating and supporting your viewpoint, and offering well-developed arguments with specific examples will significantly enhance the essay's quality. Practicing these aspects will contribute to a more focused, understandable, and persuasive essay.",3,3,3,4,4,3,1,3,4,1,Argumentative

In others, foreign language study is not a requirement. What are the potential benefits of foreign language study? Do you think foreign language study is an important part of education? \n Foreign language study in much social research of scientists is said to be an efficient method to sharpen a logical mentality and raise the brainstorming for children. I suppose it should be a requirement in all schools. \n Firstly, studying a new language brings children a chance to enlarge their cultural capital. It helps them discover and explore new conventions and historical backgrounds of countries. \n Secondly, one of the most significant roles of languages is to accessibly communicate to ""the whole world"". Professional documents can not be reserved all in only a language, so studying a new language is perfectly a great deal for children to reach the best qualifications in their major. Although their purpose is for business or just purely casual communication, languages turn out helpful and dispensable for a brilliantly successful career path. \n Thirdly, studying a foreign language is able to enhance the student's concentration and memorizing ability. Fundamentally, they have to achieve four skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking of a language if they want to use it proficiently. That is absolutely long-term and hard progress, they will need so much willingness and effort with an extreme concentration. Through practicing every day, it improves them day by day and creates them a powerful foundation of mentality. After being advanced in a language, student's intelligence would be more extended, their memorizing ability would be better organized. Probably they would become a detail-oriented, diligent, and motivated person. I strongly believe that language sharply influences student's characters as well, more patient and placid to navigate solutions for assignments and problems in communication and generally in life. \n Overall, I see that it is highly essential to make foreign language studies become required in all schools. It is genuinely worthwhile an excellent preparation for student's adulthood in their far future.","Do not refer to scientist. Always use a general reference to information. Never make it sound like you researched information. The info has to come from your personal knowledge, experience, or observations. So using general terms would be best for the presentation. When responding to the question, you cannot respond with uncertainty. You need to offer a clear and direct response to the question. There is no ""I suppose"" in the response because that would mean that you do not have a clear opinion on the topic. Uncertainty will always lead to a lower TA score because you failed to offer a direct supporting opinion or response to the given question. \n The second paragraph of this essay is difficult to understand.

That will result in an incoherent essay and problematic vocabulary usage. The second paragraph of this essay will definitely lead to a low LR and GRA score, along with an extremely affected C&C scoring due to the lack of clarity in the paragraph. \n The concluding paragraph does not represent a proper summary of the previous discussion. It is too short at only 2 sentences. That needs to be at least 3 sentences long. After all, it is a restatement of the topic and related discussion points.","The essay addresses the topic of the importance and benefits of foreign language study in education systems. It presents arguments in favor of making foreign language study a requirement in schools. Here are some points to consider for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Directness**: It's important to express your opinions clearly and confidently. Phrases like ""I suppose"" can make your argument seem uncertain. Be direct in stating your viewpoint to make your essay more persuasive and decisive.

2. **General Statements vs. Specific References**: While it can be effective to mention research or general opinions, avoid referencing scientists or specific studies unless they are directly relevant and you can discuss them in detail. Stick to general observations or personal experiences to support your points.

3. **Coherence and Clarity of Arguments**: Some paragraphs, particularly the second one, might be challenging to understand. It's crucial to express your thoughts clearly and use straightforward language. Remember, thinking in one language and writing in another can sometimes lead to confusion or awkward phrases. Aim for clarity and simplicity in your expression to ensure your arguments are easily understood.

4. **Strengthening the Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph should effectively summarize your main points and restate the importance of the topic. A conclusion that's too brief can leave the reader unsatisfied. Try to expand it by clearly summarizing the benefits of foreign language study you've discussed and reinforcing the argument for making it a requirement in schools.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several areas where the essay could benefit from a closer review of grammar and style. For example, be mindful of verb tenses, article usage (""a language"" vs. ""languages""), and sentence structure. Simplifying complex sentences can also help improve clarity.

6. **Descriptive Arguments**: The essay does well to outline several benefits of foreign language study, such as increasing cultural awareness, enhancing communication abilities, and improving cognitive skills. To strengthen these arguments, consider providing more specific examples or personal observations. This helps ground your points in real-world context and makes them more relatable and convincing.

By focusing on these aspects, the essay can become more coherent, persuasive, and engaging. Remember, clear and direct language, alongside well-structured and detailed arguments, will greatly enhance the effectiveness of your writing.",3,4,4,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, many people think that fast food companies should not be allowed to advertise, whereas others believe that all companies should have the right to advertise. From my perspective, all organizations, especially fast food enterprises should have an equal right to advertise because of the economic benefits. \n To begin with, any company needs to advertise its products to increase its sales and fame. People cannot access all products that are available in the store. By advertising, people will gain the information about the products and services, so that companies can have more buyers. For instance, the consumers can know the features of the products they have intention to buy before going to the store and consider what meets the demands of them. Additionally, advertisements also help many companies contribute to economic development. The more people buy, the more tax they have to pay for the government. \n In the current society, everyone tends to be busy doing their work or for other reasons. Many people are not able to prepare meals for their family or themselves. Therefore, a simple and convenient option is buying well served fast food because it is both fast and nutritious for a working day. For example, if people are in a hurry to go to work, they can buy bread and a coffee to save time. However, the consumers are also smart to choose the products that have a reasonable price. For these reasons, it is very essential for fast food companies to advertise their products. \n In a nutshell, advertisements provide many positive benefits for both the consumers and our society. However, it must be controlled by the government to improve health.","Ok. The essay is pretty much centered on the correct topic and reasoning discussion points. However, there is a section where there is a slight discussion topic confusion. In the first reasoning paragraph, the writer discusses advertising in relation to general goods. That is still advertising related but does not focus on the fastfood discussion from the prompt. The paragraph will not really recieve a score since it is not related to the topic as indicated. The essay needs to have stayed on track using 2 related discussion points. With only one related opinion explanation presented, the essay will be scored based on an under-developed reasoning presentation. The passing or failing of this essay will depend on the examiner's consideration of how much of the unrelated advertising paragraph he is willing to give a partial score to, if at all.","Your essay addresses the topic concerning the right of companies, including fast-food enterprises, to advertise. You've shared a clear standpoint, advocating for equal advertising rights due to economic benefits. However, there are areas where your essay can be improved to better align with the question and to enhance clarity and persuasiveness.

Firstly, while your essay begins on topic by discussing advertising's role, it detours into advertising's benefits for general goods rather than focusing solely on fast-food advertising. It's crucial that all paragraphs directly relate to the central topic — in this case, the advertising of fast-food companies. Refining your arguments to more directly address fast-food advertising will strengthen your essay and keep it aligned with the prompt.

Secondly, there are some minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues to address. For instance, ""Nowaday"" should be corrected to ""Nowadays"". Additionally, varying your sentence structure can make your writing more engaging. For example, instead of starting multiple sentences with ""Advertisements,"" try restructuring sentences or incorporating transitions to enhance flow.

Regarding clarity of your point of view, it is clear, but you could enhance your argument with more specific examples related to fast food advertising. This would not only clarify your viewpoint but also provide stronger support for your position.

You've made a valid point that advertising supports economic growth and offers convenience to consumers. Yet, you could enhance your essay by also discussing potential concerns regarding fast-food advertising, such as health implications, and then rebutting these concerns to reinforce your argument. This balanced approach would demonstrate critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the issue.

Lastly, your conclusion rightly summarizes the essay's main points but considering adding a stronger call to action or a statement that reflects on the broader implications of your argument for society or public health. This can leave the reader with a lasting impression.

Focusing on these areas for improvement will not only make your essay more relevant to the prompt but will also enhance its overall coherence, persuasiveness, and readability.

However, improvements on education have gained social endorsement as they think it's better than prison. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this idea since it nearly impossible to compare between two factors that are absolutely necessary for criminal. \n On the one hand, there has a variety of reasons that prisons are extremely necessary for social security. They are the place to keep the people who broke the law and to ensure safety of other citizens. Besides, dangerous criminals such as murderers or rapists must be imprisoned permanently so as to compensate for their heinous actions. Furthermore, being condemned to jail would appropriate freedom and have to live a miserable in a cell. Therefore, the people who tend to commit the law would reconsider before taking criminal actions. \n On the other hand, education is also considered as an important solution from the origin of crime. Education contributes greatly to heighten people's intellect and to build up a civilized society. Thanks to educational messages, people will have better awareness about the damage that crimes could cause to their community and even themselves eventually leading to the decrease in criminal rates. In addition, fundamental education like vocational training could provide a person a stable life, which could dispel completely every intentions of breaking law. \n In conclusion, dangerous objects like criminals must be punished but they also deserve to be educated well.

You aren't supposed to do that because the word ""or"" in the essay means you are expected to discuss only the opinion that you are supporting. When you discuss the one opinion that you support, include the reasons for your support in order to make an acceptable presentation of your opinion. In this essay, I am also unclear, as per your opening statement, as to which side of the discussion you do not support because you did not indicate it specifically in the opinion sentence at the close of this paragraph. So I went through your essay very confused as to which side you support because you did not really give a personal opinion discussion in the essay. Do you see why you need to discuss only one side of the opinion in this instance? Exactly, you can't have the reader guessing as to what you are trying to say. \n I would also like to advise you to improve your lexical resource / vocabulary skills. Some of the problematic references in your essay that led me to the conclusion that you need to further practice this area and become more familiar with the English language is that you kept on saying ""criminal"" when you meant to say ""crime"" and you actually referred to the ""criminal"" as an ""object"" when he is a person, not a thing. These small errors can have a very big effect on the down scoring of your essay so you should concentrate on improving your skills in this regard.","The essay addresses an important topic, deciding between prison sentences and education as solutions to crime. However, the direction of the essay could be clearer. In essays asking whether you agree or disagree with a statement, it's crucial to pick a side and develop your argument around it. The essay seemed to discuss both sides without clearly stating which side you support. Making a clear statement about your position early on will help guide the reader through your arguments.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and style, there are some areas for improvement:
- Be careful with word choice. For example, you repeatedly use ""criminal"" when ""crime"" might be more appropriate. Additionally, referring to a person as an ""object"" is inaccurate; ""individual"" or ""person"" would be correct.
- Consider revising phrases like ""nearly impossible to compare between two factors"" to ""nearly impossible to compare two factors,"" for clarity.
- Pay attention to your article use (""a"" vs. ""the"") and prepositions. For example, ""condemned to jail would appropriate freedom"" seems to be missing words or using them incorrectly.

It’s evident that your essay intended to provide a balanced view by presenting arguments for both prison and education in addressing crime. However, focusing on presenting clear and descriptive arguments for the position you agree with would strengthen your essay. Provide specific examples and reasons why you support that side, which will make your position clearer to the reader.

Your essay does successfully introduce the idea that both education and prison sentences have roles in handling crime, suggesting that a combined approach might be effective. This shows a good understanding of the complexity of the issue. To improve, clarify your point of view at the beginning and develop your essay around that perspective.

Lastly, enhancing your vocabulary and being mindful of how specific words change the meaning of your sentences will greatly benefit your writing. Practicing using varied vocabulary in the correct context can help avoid misunderstandings.

The fact that the cost of a cosmetic surgery and high-tech beauty devices are ordinarily out of touc h with people who have a low or medium income. \n One of the other drawbacks is that there are a larger amount of bad effects on health when people attempt to have a pretty and youthful imagine by unnatural approaches. Some beauty products which are bad quality can have unwanted effects when people apply them on skin, hair. In fact, in some bad situations, people might come out in a rash on their body or even catch a skin cancer if they use that products in a long time. Furthermore, cosmetic surgeries as cheek lift, breast lift can carry potential risks. People have higher risk of developing complications such as heart attack, lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke and shorten their life span. \n In conclusion, to look younger can make people be more confident with their body imagine. However, the disadvantages of beauty methods are extremely serious therefore people should not overuse them.","Dear student, while your approach to the essay is acceptable, your opening paragraph is not accurate paraphrase of the original prompt, your paragraphs are not fully developed, and your concluding paragraph is not a proper summary of the preceding discussion. After that listing, I now want to individually discuss the mistakes that you made. That way you will be very clear about the error in your writing and be able to correct in the future. \n The opening paraphrase and the concluding summary must be comprised of at least 3 sentences in order to gain proper GRA and C&C scoring considerations. Writing long sentences may seem proper to you but in terms of scoring, you lose points because all you did was write run-on sentences. Overly long sentences, that are separated by commas when periods should have been used shows a lack of punctuation knowledge and little developed sentence structuring skills. Always use the 3-5 sentence paragraph presentation and refrain from using commas when periods are more applicable. These are writing methods that are guaranteed to increase your GRA and C&C scores. \n Try to limit your discussion per paragraph to only one topic. You see, when you present more than one topic per paragraph, you don't really get to explain your reasons for saying such a thing. Instead, you only present so-called ""Talking Points"" which means you only provide possible reasons but no supporting evidence for your claims. This weakens the C&C presentation even further and lessens the overall scoring potential of your presentation. \n Now, for the closing paragraph, never present additional reasoning in this paragraph because this is called a summary conclusion for a reason. A summary conclusion takes the shortened version of the body paragraphs , the reasons you provided, then presents it as a reminder to the reader. Then a closing sentence is made by repeating your opinion of the topic. That is why a summary conclusion should never include a new or additional information for discussion. You only have 5 paragraphs for this type of essay writing and each paragraph has a specific function, as you know for sure, that is used to present your discussion of the topic. \n Should you decide to apply the corrections to your writing that I suggest, I believe that you will see a marked improvement not only in your writing skills, but also you overall score.","The essay addresses the topic about the desire of people to appear younger and outlines the author's viewpoint that this trend is negative. However, there are several areas that need improvement for this essay to more effectively communicate its message and meet English proficiency testing standards. 

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay touches upon the subject but could better introduce and summarize the topic with more clarity. Ensuring the opening paragraph effectively sets the stage for your argument, and using at least 3 sentences can help. Similarly, the concluding paragraph should also be expanded to properly encapsulate the discussion without introducing new ideas, serving as a reminder of the points made.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay suffers from some grammatical and punctuation errors, particularly with run-on sentences and inappropriate comma usage where periods would be more appropriate. Shorter sentences can improve readability and help avoid confusion. Consider reviewing basic punctuation rules and sentence structure to enhance the clarity of your writing. Additionally, attention should be paid to spelling and correct word usage to avoid detracting from the essay's professionalism.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your viewpoint is clear; however, it could be emphasized with stronger introduction and conclusion paragraphs. Declaring your stance at the beginning and reiterating it at the end with conviction can make your viewpoint more impactful.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Each paragraph should ideally focus on one main idea or argument to avoid confusion and to allow for a more in-depth exploration of each point. The essay attempts to provide support for its claims but often falls short in fully developing these ideas or providing substantial evidence. Limiting the scope of discussion in each paragraph to a single topic and then elaborating on it will not only make your arguments clearer but also more persuasive. Furthermore, avoid introducing new arguments in your conclusion; this section should summarize and reinforce the arguments made, not present new information.

Improving these aspects of the essay will not only clarify your arguments but also enhance the readability and effectiveness of your writing. Breaking down your points into structured, concise paragraphs and focusing on supporting your claims with clear evidence or examples will significantly benefit your essay's overall coherence and persuasiveness. Remember to proofread your work for any spelling or grammatical errors, as these can distract from the content of your essay. With practice and attention to these details, your writing skills and scores will surely improve.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Write about: laziness and how it influences our life,"There is a truth that never changes: laziness is a disease having no preventive vaccine. Everyone over the world, whether they are, may be lazy at any time. Despite negative impact, I firmly believe that laziness could offer many interesting things. \n Nowadays, the workloads and work pressure are getting more intense and have increased the stress level of many employees. Many people feel tired, depressed and hopeless due to their boring routine activities that seem to reduce the meaning of their lives. Therefore, losing the motivation to succeed makes them become lazy. This made me remember a famous quote: ""On the way to success, there is no trace of lazy men"". Hardworking does not ensure success but successful people must work hard. So, if we have a dream, we should remember grit is the key to make it become true. The power of passion and perseverance helps us overcome difficulties and obstacles to enjoy the sense of achievement. \n On the other hand, we cannot deny laziness is a motivation for creation and invention. Bill Gates once humorously said that: ""I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job... because he will find an easy way to do it"". I know a poor worker was bored with his repetitive job. So, he strove to find a new way to do it easily and automatically. The worker in this story is Elias Howe who invented the sewing machine that changed the world industry. His laziness made him become a great inventor. \n Therefore, if you consider it is difficult to leave your comfortable bed tomorrow morning, maybe this is the time for you to abandon old routines. Do not stop imaging about the fabulous things ahead and looking for new challenges, your laziness is a relaxing moment before continuing your life journey.","Dear student, the essay is asking you to discuss the effects of laziness on your life, not the life of other people. Therefore the response that you wrote is incorrect. You wrote about a general observation regarding laziness instead of how laziness affects your own life. The approach to the essay should be as follows: \n <em>Everyone tends to be lazy some days, most days, or everyday. I am one of those people who tends to be lazy most of the day. While I realize that laziness prevents me from having a productive day, I still find that I cannot bring myself to accomplish necessary tasks and chores. Which leads to some very negative effects in my life.<br/><br/>Take for example, when I wake up in the morning, I lie in bed an additional half an hour. Even though my alarm clock keeps ringing, I keep on hitting the snooze button an extra ten minutes. The result, is a rushed start to the day. I end up late for school, late for my extra curricular activities, and late getting home.</em> \n What I wrote is an example of how you can start an essay with this topic. The focus of the essay should clearly be on you by indicating times when laziness has had a negative effect on your life directly. It should not refer to other people because the essay asks about the effect on you. So the pronouns, ""Me, my, myself, I"" will be in play for this essay.","This essay makes an interesting argument about the effects of laziness, suggesting that it can lead to both negative outcomes and unexpected benefits like creativity and invention. However, there's a significant aspect of the assignment that hasn't been fully addressed. The prompt seeks an examination of how laziness affects one's own life, but the essay primarily discusses laziness in a broader, more general context. Focusing on personal experiences with laziness and its impacts on your life would make the response more relevant to the topic. 

Regarding the essay's content, it's clear and engaging in presenting arguments on laziness. However, shifting the focus to include personal examples would provide a stronger case and make the essay more in line with the asked response. 

Spelling and grammar are mostly correct throughout the essay, with only minor errors detected. Attention to smoother transitions between sentences and consistency in tense would improve readability and flow.

The essay's structure is sound, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, ensuring that each part aligns more closely with the personal impact of laziness would strengthen the overall essay.

The point of view is generally clear, but it should be more focused on the author's personal experiences and perspectives concerning laziness. Using first-person pronouns such as ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" and ""myself"" will help center the essay on your personal experiences, as requested by the prompt.

The use of descriptive arguments and examples, like the story of Elias Howe, is compelling but would be more effective if related to personal instances of how laziness spurred creativity or led to challenges in your life.

In conclusion, while the essay provides thoughtful consideration on the topic of laziness, adjusting the focus to reflect personal experiences and effects would align it more closely with the task's requirements. Incorporating specific instances where laziness had a direct impact on your life, whether positive or negative, would provide a more compelling and nuanced exploration of the subject.",3,4,3,3,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Some adhere to the idea that it is solely the parent's responsibility to raise their young in order for them to become good citizens, whereas others believe that it is predominantly the school's role to do so. The following paragraphs will discuss in detail both points of view and argue why it isn't only the family member's responsibility. \n The parents have one of the biggest impacts on a child's future if not the biggest. In their childhood, parents are the people that teach their kids manners, basic skills and how to respect one another. Without manners a child's life would be hard done(???), as they would have an awful time trying to socialize because of the way they act in general. In addition, without basic skills, they would never know how to be independent individuals and have to always rely on someone else (who might not always be there for them). It is undoubtable that a child's outcome will depend heavily on the mother and fathers' ability to teach them these. But I disagree that it's the parent's responsibility alone. \n As children spend a large proportion of their early life at school, it should definitely be the school's duty also. While in school, they learn basic knowledge such as math or spelling and how to obey rules, which would be crucial in becoming good members of their society. Going into life without basic education would most likely result in being unemployed or working at a devastatingly low salary; provided that(I don't think this is the right usage of this phrase; try something else), they would also be laughed at by others and no one would respect them. Not learning the importance of obeying the law could get them into deep trouble or even incarceration. Overall, the importance of school for a person is undeniable.","Okay, you have a mistake in your prompt paraphrase. The discussion instruction is improperly presented. It is not the essay that will discuss the topic, the topic will be discussed by the writer based on a set of reasons, which will lead to the writer creating an opinion. So the last part of the paragraph should read like this: \n <em>Due to the varying ideas regarding this topic, it is important to consider the reasons behind the support that people give each idea. By presenting a discussion of these ideas, I will be be able to craft a personal opinion as the final word on this topic.</em> \n By the way, never say that a topic is debatable in a Task 2 essay. These are never debates. These are always discussions, comparisons, or opinions. There is never a fiery debate, a debatable topic, or an ongoing debate. Just word variations on the term ""discussion"". Examiners do not like the use of these exaggerated expressions as it removes the formal and academic discussion presentation of the given issue. \n The format of your essay is not really based on the expected discussion presentation. Your essay comes across as a solid personal opinion, without considering the discussion as required by the prompt. The required discussion uses first, second, and third person pronouns or group / plural reference words for the 2 discussion ideas and then your personal opinion, uses first person pronouns in the presentation. That is because the essay needs to clearly point out the positions being discussed and whose side it being presented. It helps create the coherence and clarity in the discussion because this is your opportunity to use transition sentences in the proper manner at the end of each paragraph discussion. \n Your lack of ownership words plus the singular opinion approach will be the reasons why this essay will not be able to achieve a passing score. Your reference topic sentences should be similar to: \n Par. 2: Considering the people who think that... <b>Their</b> opinion is based on... That is why <em>they</em> use the example of... \n Par. 3: Basing the idea of... on the belief of <b>groups</b> that... <b>They</b> have convinced <b>themselves</b> that... \n Par. 4: Owing to these explanations, <b>I</b> have become enlightened about the topic. Using <b>myself</b> as an example... <b>My</b> experience therefore supports... \n Plural and singular pronouns need to be used to show your GRA range. I have highlighted the pronouns used that will add to the score for that section. I have shown you the expected discussion format as well. While you did use various pronouns in your presentation, you have to understand that the IELTS is written in a specific method and as such, have an expected discussion format that the examiner looks for. Remember, the comparison essays with a personal opinion will always need 5 paragraphs and require the use of correct pronouns in the topic sentences located at the start of the paragraphs.","This essay approaches an important topic about who should bear the responsibility of helping children grow up to become beneficial members of society. The effort to explore the roles of parents and schools in this development is acknowledged. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the argument presented.

Firstly, the introduction to the topic should be rephrased to better suit the requirements of an academic discussion or essay. Instead of suggesting that the essay will discuss the topic, it is more appropriate to indicate that the writer will explore various viewpoints and use those discussions to form a personal opinion. Avoid terms such as ""debatable"" in favor of more neutral language like ""discussion"". This maintains the formal tone expected in academic writing. A revised introduction might clearly state the intention to explore different reasons behind the varying support for each viewpoint, leading to the formation of a personal opinion.

The essay structure would benefit from a clearer distinction between the presentation of different perspectives and the author’s own viewpoint. Utilizing first, second, and third person pronouns correctly can help in making this distinction clear. For example, when discussing other people's opinions, use ""they"" or ""their"" to clarify that you are referring to a group's perspective and not your own. In contrast, use ""I"" or ""my"" when presenting your personal viewpoint. This not only improves the range of grammatical accuracy but also aids in clearly delineating between discussed viewpoints and personal opinions, enhancing the essay's coherence.

It is crucial to employ a five-paragraph structure for essays that compare different viewpoints and include a personal opinion. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that sets out the main idea of that paragraph, using appropriate pronouns to signal whether the paragraph will discuss another's viewpoint or your own. This structure ensures clarity and helps guide the reader through your argumentation.

Regarding the content, ensure to support your claims with clear, specific examples, and logical reasoning. While the essay mentions the importance of manners, basic skills, and education provided by parents and schools, fleshing out these points with more detailed examples or evidence could strengthen your position. Avoid unclear phrases like ""hard done"" and incorrect usage of terms such as ""provided that,"" which may confuse readers. Instead, opt for clearer expressions and check that phrases are used correctly within context.

Finally, pay close attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, as these can detract from the overall effectiveness of your argument. Consider revising phrases for clarity and correctness, ensuring your essay communicates your ideas effectively and professionally.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly enhance the quality of your essay, making your arguments more compelling and your writing more aligned with academic standards.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

The following essay focuses on the main reasons for being up of sugar-based beverages and proposes a number of solutions to make improve this situation. \n In terms of the leading reason, many corporations in the food and beverage business invest millions to make their drinks appear on all social media platforms. They hire models and celebrities to promote their new or renowned items, which draw the attention of large crowds, particularly young people. For example, Black Pink represented the Pepsi brand in 2020, allowing their revenue to massively increase. Furthermore, these beverages actually include a lot of additives such as caffeine and colorants. These substances provide an instant energy boost and help people to focus on their work and study, although they are detrimental to human health. Consequently, people drink more sugar-based drinks. \n What is needed to combat this problem is definite action. The most apparent approach, in my opinion, is the government's attention to imposing higher taxes on the manufacture and distribution of sugary beverages. Prices would rise significantly, but consumer purchases would decrease. Another solution to this problem would be to reduce advertising about sugary beverages in the media. Alternatively, there are programs that should be broadcasted to raise customers' knowledge of the possible medical concerns of sweetened sodas. \n In conclusion, influential commercials and addictive chemicals caused an expansion in the use of soft drinks. It is essential for both individuals and governments to implement effective sugar-reduction strategies.","I reviewed the original prompt and discovered that there is no reference to obesity or blood vessel diseases. These are considered results of overconsumption but were never referenced in the original prompt. Neither does it respond to either of the questions being asked in the discussion instruction. Therefore, the first sentence of this prompt restatement is useless and will only result in an inaccurate interpretation of the original topic. Never include references that are not included in the original as it lessens the accuracy of the reworded statement. While establishing what the essay discussion will be about shows that the writer is capable of properly repeating the instructions, that does not meet the ""clear opinion"" representation since it does not offer direct responses to the questions provided. Questions that, when answered in the short form, allows the examiner to score the comprehension and quick reasoning skills of the writer in relation to TA requirements. \n While the discussion provided is good, seeing as it properly responded to both questions in separate paragraphs, it could have been better. By using individual paragraphs to state the reason for the problem and then, explaining how to solve the problem in the same paragraph, the writer will have the opportunity to present more reasons and solutions (at least 2 of each) that would help the examiner provide a higher scoring consideration for the C+C sections, both of which require a clear explanation and connected discussion format in the presentation. So the format would be more effective as: \n Sentence 1: Reason \n Sentence 2: Explanation \n Sentence 3: Example \n Sentence 4: Solution \n Sentence 5: Explanation \n By using the format above, the writer will allow himself the opportunity to create more cohesive discussion paragraphs of the advanced kind. It avoids the need to constantly try to keep the paragraphs connected when a separate reason and solution paragraph is created. It is simpler to write and easier to connect in terms of topic coverage.","Your essay on the consumption of sweetened drinks and its consequences presents several key points worth discussing. However, there are areas where improvement is necessary to enhance the clarity, relevance, and structure of your essay, ensuring it fully responds to the specified topic and instructions.

1. **Topic Relevance**: Your introduction mentions health issues related to sweetened drinks, such as obesity and blood vessel disease, which were not specified in the prompt. It's important to stay on topic by directly addressing the questions or statements given in the prompt. Ensure your introduction aligns closely with the prompt's requirements without introducing unrelated information. This will help keep your essay focused and accurate.

2. **Structure and Organization**: Your essay has a solid foundation but could greatly benefit from a more structured approach to discussing reasons and solutions related to the consumption of sugary beverages. A suggested format might include: 
   - **Sentence 1**: State a reason for the problem.
   - **Sentence 2**: Provide an explanation of this reason.
   - **Sentence 3**: Give a specific example that illustrates this reason.
   - **Sentence 4**: Propose a solution to address this reason.
   - **Sentence 5**: Explain how this solution could be effective.
   
   This format allows for a more cohesive and comprehensive discussion, ensuring each paragraph fully explores both a problem and its potential solution. It can also make your essay easier to follow and strengthen the connection between your ideas.

3. **Clarity and POV**: While your essay presents a clear stance on the issue, ensuring that your point of view remains consistent and is supported by well-explained arguments and examples could further strengthen your position. Each paragraph should clearly convey your perspective, backed by logical reasoning and relevant evidence.

4. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues**: Pay close attention to spelling, grammar, and style throughout your essay. Minor errors can detract from the overall quality and weaken your argument. Consider reading your essay aloud or using writing tools to spot and correct these mistakes.

5. **Engagement and Examples**: Your use of an example involving the brand Pepsi and the group Black Pink effectively illustrates the influence of marketing on beverage consumption. Continue to use specific and relevant examples like this to support your points. Make sure each example directly ties back to your argument and helps to clarify your position.

I do not think that the advantages of changing jobs outweigh the disadvantages from many aspects. \n There are some reasons why young people would change their jobs every few years. For instance, changing the workplace can help them develop other professional skills. Because it is more competitive for young people in the workforce today than in the past, learning more skills in workplaces can give them more job opportunities. Besides, this phenomenon usually results from the payment. If other positions or occupations offer a better salary, they are easily to change their jobs. In general, young people can get benefits from changing jobs or careers. \n On the other hand, changing jobs too often has some disadvantages. Firstly, this may post a threat to their job security. Employers are easily to think that they are not loyal to their companies. Secondly, if young people change jobs too often, they might lose chances of promotion. It could be seen in many companies that most managers or directors are experienced and have devoted themselves to the same position or company for several years. Thirdly, for those young people who are easily to change their job often, they have to spend time on searching a new room or flat as well to shorten their traveling time to work. \n From my point of view, there are both advantages and disadvantages of changing a job or career.

These are all good traits in the essay. However, there are still a few shortcomings that should have been addressed. \n First of all, you never offer an opinion or a point of view in the summary statement. Aside from the paraphrasing, you should only offer an outline of the discussion to follow, without any additional information yet. The reason you should not include information in the first paragraph is the same reason why you are not allowed to introduce new information in the conclusion, you will be unable to properly develop the reason at that point so it is best to give it a stand alone, explanatory paragraph within the essay instead. \n The essay would also have been better presented and have more of an authoritative slant if you had presented only one advantage and disadvantage to discuss in separate paragraphs. It is not the number of supporting facts that you present to the examiner that matters but the quality of the supporting facts. If it shows a clear ability to analyze a statement and defend it in English, then your grammar accuracy and task accuracy will be scored higher. \n That said, you also failed to develop a proper concluding statement for the essay. Please refer to the reasons I cited for the opening statement for the explanation of the mistake in your concluding statement. \n Due to these reasons, it will be most likely that you would not score higher than a 5.","The essay provides a balanced view on the topic of young people changing jobs frequently. It discusses both the advantages and disadvantages of changing jobs or careers, which shows an understanding of the prompt.

Moreover, the essay successfully outlines some negative outcomes of frequently changing jobs, like reduced job security and missed promotion opportunities. This ability to identify and discuss several aspects of the topic is a strength of the essay.

However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make it more effective and coherent. First, the introductory paragraph should focus solely on introducing the topic and outlining the discussion that will follow. Including specific opinions or additional information in the introduction, as done in this essay, can make it less clear and structured. It's better to save the analysis and detailed arguments for the body paragraphs.

Regarding the body of the essay, it might be more impactful to concentrate on elaborating extensively on one advantage and one disadvantage of changing jobs. This approach allows for deeper analysis and a more thorough explanation of each point, which can make the argument more convincing. The current essay tends to list reasons rather than explore them in depth, which can dilute the essay's effectiveness.

The essay also experiences some grammatical and stylistic issues, particularly with repetitive and awkward phrasing (""they are easily to change their jobs"" should be ""they easily change their jobs"") and incorrect usage (""post a threat"" should be ""pose a threat""). Addressing these errors will greatly improve the clarity and professionalism of the writing.

Lastly, the conclusion of the essay could be strengthened. It currently restates the main points but misses the opportunity to provide a compelling final thought or recommendation. A strong conclusion succinctly summarizes the key arguments made and reinforces the author's point of view, giving the reader a clear sense of closure and the essay's overall stance.

Improving these aspects of the essay will not only make the argument more persuasive and cohesive but also demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency.

However, in this modern society, some people say that with the considerable computers and the internet bring about, they can completely replace the traditional role of a teacher. I partly agree with it because of some reasons. \n On the one hand, I think computers bring about a lot of benefits. We can search anything we don't know on the internet to get information. In addition, we can learn many things that we aren't taught at school. For example, you can learn to play the guitar or other musical instruments. Besides, you can improve your foreign languages if you use computer wisely, such as learning Englisch by music or movies. Moreover, with a computer connected the ethernet, students can learn online at any time, in anywhere and with anyone. Therefore, nowadays, most of the people use the computer to study or work more effectively. \n On the other hand, computers and the internet also have many disadvantages because there are both good and bad things on the internet. Students haven't been mature so that they can easily be affected by negative factors. Besides, when they self-study, they may find it hard to concentrate on the lessons on the web. Moreover, if children study with a computer instead of going to school, they can get some diseases such as nearsightedness or a headache. \n Therefore, the role of traditional teachers is very important. When students don't understand the lessons, they can ask for the answer, so their study will be effective.

Thus, students and teachers can make a good relationship and students will be more confident to face up the life. \n To sum up, we shouldn't appreciate very high the play of computer and the internet.

Therefore, the final score for that sort of unique discussion will solely be up to the discretion of the examiner.

Otherwise, the examiner could choose to deduct points for non-compliance with the preset instructions in the prompt.","The essay engages with a significant topic concerning the role of teachers versus technology in modern education. The argument presented showcases a balanced view, acknowledging benefits and challenges associated with both traditional teaching methods and the use of computers and the internet for learning. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to enhance clarity, relevance, and compliance with the task requirements.

Starting with the introduction, it is crucial to paraphrase the essay topic instead of restating it directly from the prompt. This approach demonstrates comprehension and the ability to express original thought, both of which are key evaluation criteria. To improve, try summarizing the essay's question in your own words, clearly outlining your stance on the issue from the outset.

Regarding the essay's structure, while presenting both sides of an argument can enrich the essay, it's important to ensure that this dual perspective aligns with the specific requirements of the task. If the prompt asks you to take a definitive stance, it is essential to do so while perhaps briefly acknowledging counterarguments. This clarity in position helps in meeting the precise expectations of the examination instructions.

The essay would benefit from careful attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For example, the word ""Englisch"" should be corrected to ""English,"" and phrases like ""connected the ethernet"" could be revised to ""connected to the internet"" for better clarity. Paying attention to these details will enhance the overall readability and professional tone of the essay.

Additionally, while the points made are generally clear, they could be strengthened through more specific examples and clearer argumentation. For instance, when discussing the advantages and disadvantages of learning through technology, provide concrete examples or statistics to support your claims. This approach offers tangible evidence to the reader, making your arguments more persuasive.

Lastly, the conclusion rightly emphasizes a balanced perspective on the use of computers versus traditional teaching but could be more impactful by succinctly summarizing the key arguments made. Restate why the role of teachers remains indispensable, even in an era dominated by technology, to reinforce your viewpoint.

In summary, focusing on paraphrasing the prompt, clearly articulating a stance compliant with the task requirements, addressing linguistic inaccuracies, and enhancing arguments with specific evidence will greatly improve the essay's effectiveness and alignment with English proficiency standards.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

In addition, the proportion of children were born yearly and rate of elderly have strongly developed and do not have any signs of decline, this will lead to deficiency of accommodation, occupation, foodstuff, etc. For instance, children, especially in many over-crowded countries like India, who were born will not have enough places or nutrition to grow normally as others children. Moreover, industrialization in developing countries also bitterly affects environment through companies' fume releases or excessive exploitation of natural resources and energy. This lead to a high damaged and lack to people's life and health and a large amount of money has been allocating to address these problems. Therefore, it is substantial to explore a new form of life outer-space for high demands of better living. \n On the other hand, it is possible to say that with the assistance of advanced facilities, human finally can explore deeper the vast universe and visiting another planet is no longer become impossible task. Thanks to incessant development of technology especially in cosmology, this field has grown in a startling pace and day-by-day brings mankind closer to the universe. Regardless of how much budget were spend on researching or traveling into space, the progress has its unique advantages and play a pivotal role in widening people's knowledge about anything outside our ""home''. Moreover, Novel opportunities ranging from space tourism to mining for valuable rare metals could be also enormously profitable \n In conclusion, this development brings to mankind huge knowledge and value exploration. However; I cannot posit that this is the only way for governments in finding solution for human issues, especially to developing or poor countries which need a big preference on addressing issues about standard living of residents.","The first sentence of the just sentence is nothing more than an excercise in incorrect vocabulary usage and, incoherent thought presentation. That introduction just rambled on as a run-on, without actually establishing any content in the paragraph. The question response is also out of format as it is not an extent response as instructed. The essay will fail based on TA deductions alone. \n The author is challenging an unspecified school of thought rather than offering a degree of disagreement. This is a prompt change from the original that will be given a failed score as it does not respond to the question as required. The overall response to the essay shows an overabundance of English vocabulary but a lack of writing instruction understanding. The length and content of the discussion becomes irrelevant at that point. The essay has already failed.","The essay attempts to address the debate around the merits of space exploration versus addressing Earth's immediate problems, presenting arguments for the former. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and direct response to the question posed. Here are the specific points of feedback:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay slightly misses the mark in clearly responding to the given prompt. The prompt asks for a position on a specific matter, but the essay deviates by challenging an unspecified school of thought without clearly stating the extent of agreement or disagreement. It's important to address the question directly and develop the essay based on that stance.

2. **Introduction Clarity and Coherence:** The introductory sentence is confusing and does not set a clear topic for the rest of the essay. Try to start with a simpler, more direct statement that introduces the debate or issue at hand. Avoid long, run-on sentences and ensure that the introduction provides a solid foundation for your arguments.

3. **Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:** While it's commendable to use a rich vocabulary, it's equally important to ensure that words are used correctly and sentences are coherent. Some sentences in the essay are overly complex or constructed in a way that makes them hard to follow. Simplifying the language and sentence structure will make the essay more understandable and engaging.

4. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay that can distract the reader and make it harder to follow your argument. Taking the time to proofread and correct these errors will significantly improve the clarity and professionalism of the writing.

5. **Supporting Arguments:** The essay provides examples and reasons to support the exploration of space, which is a strength. However, to strengthen your position further, ensure that each argument is clearly stated and supported with specific, descriptive details. It's not enough to assert that space exploration could solve issues; showing *how* it could do so will make your argument more convincing.

6. **Point of View Clarity:** Your stance on space exploration is implied, but it could be stated more clearly. Ensure that your point of view is explicitly mentioned early in the essay to guide readers through your arguments.

7. **Conclusion and Balanced View:** The conclusion reintroduces the main ideas but could more effectively summarize the arguments and restate your position. While it's good to acknowledge the complexities of the issue, make sure the conclusion leaves the reader with a clear understanding of your stance.

Improving these areas will make the essay more coherent, engaging, and directly responsive to the test question. Taking time to plan the structure, enhance sentence clarity, and refine your arguments will greatly benefit your writing.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

Ielts 2 essay,"Opinions are divided on whether music is just a method for entertaining, or whether it has an essential impact on society. While I understand why some people support the former view, I am still in favour of the latter. \n Those who believe that music is simply a form of entertainment may have several arguments. From their point of view, there are many ways to entertain better than music, so music does not have major influences on them. People will underestimate the importance of music if they feel interested in sport. Another point is that some of us may not gain advantages such as relaxation, joy from music. This is the factor behind the reason why people ignore the positive role of music and assess it is just a form of entertainment. \n Nevertheless, I still think that those who believe that music is essential in society for several reasons. Chief among these is that music has profound impacts on our mental health. It helps us relax and reduce the risk of stress. Furthermore, choosing appropriate types of music to listen to at different time in a day can improve memory and concentration. Looking at the second idea, music plays an important role in life because it offers chances for us to have a job related to this field. For instance, due to music, not only do musicians compose a lot of popular songs but also theaters can maintain their operation. This allows us to make a living and boost our life quality. \n In conclusion, despite acknowledging why people think that music is normally a form of entertainment, I still hold the belief that it has enormous influences on our society.","The prompt paraphrase you presented is creative and connects the two public discussion points in a cohesive manner. You used an excellent / coherent presentation method that shows an understanding of the topic and a clear control of writing using cohesive devices. However, your opinion presentation is incorrect. You are not supposed to refer to a side to support since you you have not considered the discussion requirements yet. Rather, you should have done one of two things: \n - Given a clear opinion that could be separate from the two given points of view \n - Given a general statement that would have indicated a comparative point of view for both opinions ( ex. I would like to consider the merits of both sides before giving my opinion for each discussion topic.) \n The reason for these 2 choices is that you are being asked to write a comparative + personal opinion essay. This is weakly referenced in your presentation as you did not properly develop the discussion points based on the 5 paragraph format. You opted to use the 5 paragraph format when you stated an opinion as a part of the thesis statement in paragraph 1. The format for the discussion paragraphs should have been: \n Par. 1: Restatement + opinion \n Par. 2: Fully developed discussion of the first point of view (topic sentence, reason for public opinion, example, additional supporting sentence (optional) transition sentence to the next point of view) \n Par. 3: Content is the same as Par. 2 using the second topic \n Par. 4: Detailed personal opinion that follows the content format for the previous 2 paragraphs \n Par. 5: Summary conclusion that reiterates your opinion at the end \n Your second paragraph combined 2 discussion points that needed to be considered separately based on formatting and C&C requirements. As such, this paragraph became under developed, lacking in both coherence and cohesiveness due to the badly discussed reason presentations. It does not have any real convincing elements included for either subject that could properly explain the public points of view to the examiner. Refer to the paragraph content as I mentioned above for specific discussion requirements for each paragraph. \n The summary conclusion at the end that summarizes your discussion points as scored as a part of your overall scoring consideration. Properly restating the previous discussion in short form, adds to your TA, LR, GRA, and C&C score because it shows that you are capable of restating the full discussion in an alternative form (similar to, but different in presentation from the prompt restatement paragraph). That is why this is called a reverse paraphrase. It is just as important as the prompt restatement at the start due to its ability to further increase your final overall score. \n The concluding paragraph you presented would have had a clearer presentation if you had divided the thoughts into at least 2 sentences. You created a run on sentence that focused only on your point of view, totally negating the prior discussion points presented in the original prompt. As there is no accurate restatement in this concluding summary, it cannot be considered properly developed and helpful to the closing of the opinion statement. In this manner, this section will lower your GRA and TA score rather than help to increase it.","The essay presents a creative introduction by paraphrasing the prompt, linking two public discussion points effectively. This demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and strong control over writing with the use of cohesive devices. However, the presentation of the opinion could be improved. It is essential to explicitly state a clear personal opinion that is separate from the discussed viewpoints or present a general statement that considers the merits of both sides. This approach is crucial in comparative and personal opinion essays, indicating areas for development in your essay structure and argumentation.

Regarding the essay's structure, a more effective organization would follow a five-paragraph format, starting with a restatement of the topic plus your personal opinion. Each of the following paragraphs should fully develop one point of view, providing reasons, examples, and possibly an additional supporting sentence, followed by a transition to the next viewpoint. The fourth paragraph should detail your personal opinion, following the content format of the previous paragraphs. Lastly, a properly constructed conclusion should summarize your discussion points and reiterate your opinion, helping to enhance your scores by showcasing your ability to reformulate the discussion succinctly, known as a reverse paraphrase.

The second paragraph merges two discussion points, making it underdeveloped and lacking in coherence and cohesion. Each viewpoint should be discussed separately, with clear, convincing arguments that explain the public points of view effectively. Adopting the suggested paragraph content will enhance your essay's clarity and persuasiveness.

The concluding paragraph could be clearer by dividing thoughts into separate sentences. Focusing solely on your point of view without incorporating a concise recap of the discussion points can make the conclusion feel disconnected from the rest of the essay. A well-developed conclusion restates the discussion briefly, which could improve your scores by demonstrating comprehensive understanding and effective summarization skills.

Overall, refining the presentation of your opinion, adhering to a structured essay format, and ensuring a cohesive and coherent argument will significantly improve the quality of your essay. Focus on developing each point of view thoroughly in separate paragraphs and conclude your essay with a strong summary that reflects on the discussion holistically. These adjustments will help make your essay more persuasive and impactful.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

In my opinion, the merits outweigh the drawbacks. \n There are some considerable benefits to ordering products from shopping websites. For customers themselves they can easily access to a wide range of goods on online market platform. Furthermore, buyers can make comparisons of price, quality and customer services between similar products of many shops without driving to the stores one-by-one. Instead of that, they find it easier to scroll and switch tabs to find out which is the best for them. Another thing to concern is that online merchants do not have to pay the business premises rent (except for warehouse to store); as a result, the price of their products will be cut down and customers will find cheaper things on the Internet. \n However, there are some potential drawbacks to shopping online. One of them is risk of getting lower quality products than shops' descriptions. This is because just can judge the stuff they want through edited photos and catchy advertisements. Therefore, online marketplaces are the golden opportunities for fraud and scammers. \n In conclusion, online shopping can bring convenience to costumers, also it can ease the financial problems of both buyers and sellers. However, scams are the risks that customers should avoid from. In this situation, this can be dealt when seller platforms give a lot methods for buyers, such as shop rating, review boxes, refund-guaranteed products and whatnots. Therefore, in my viewpoint the merits surpass the demerits.","Being a single opinion essay, you need to ensure that you provide a defense only for the side that you support. You do that by using the The topic sentences for each paragraph to show the strength of your argument. For example, you can approach the essay with the following discussion: \n <em>Most people view online shopping as a convenient replacement for real-time shopping. However, hazards for this type of shopping prove to be one of the biggest disadvantages of online purchasing. There was this one time when I purchased a usb through online shopping and...<br/><br/>My cousin also purchased a dress online and the size was wrong...</em> \n You have to make sure that the reviewer knows that you are basing the disadvantage on something you experienced because that is what the essay instructed. It says you have to base the reasons on personal experience and other knowledge. So, in no particular order, the reasons should be one first person pronoun paragraph, then a second person pronoun paragraph. You don't have to worry about information accuracy. You are not going to be scored on that. You can lie about the information if you want to. It is more important to use the pronouns implied in the essay for the GRA scoring considerations.","The essay addresses the topic of online shopping effectively, focusing on its benefits and drawbacks. However, there are several areas where it could be improved to meet test standards and provide a more compelling argument.

1- **Response to the Topic**: The essay does well in discussing the pros and cons of online shopping, which indicates that it is responsive to the topic. To strengthen your argument, it would be beneficial to include personal experiences or specific examples. Sharing a personal story related to online shopping can make your essay more relatable and persuasive. For instance, mentioning an experience with purchasing a product online that did not meet expectations could illustrate the risk of receiving lower quality goods.

2- **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""tending to purchasing"" should be ""tending towards purchasing"" and ""costumers"" should be ""customers"". It's also important to maintain consistency in tense and to make sure sentences flow naturally. Furthermore, breaking down longer sentences into shorter, clearer ones could enhance readability. Paying attention to these details will improve the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.

3- **Clarity of Author’s Point of View**: The essay presents a viewpoint that the benefits of online shopping outweigh its drawbacks. This position is clear, but it could be reinforced by clearly stating your stance in both the introduction and conclusion. Using phrases like “In my opinion” or “From my perspective” at the beginning could solidify your position from the onset.

4- **Arguments and Support**: The essay lists several advantages and disadvantages of online shopping but lacks depth in the arguments presented. Including more detailed explanations, factual support, or statistics could strengthen your claims. For the GRA scoring, it’s important to apply both first and second person pronouns appropriately to make the essay personal and direct. This means including paragraphs that use ""I"" to share personal experiences and ""you"" to engage directly with the reader or relate to a shared experience. This approach not only meets the essay's requirements but also makes your writing more engaging and persuasive.

Improving these aspects will make your essay more effective and more likely to achieve a higher score. Remember, the goal is to make your argument as clear and convincing as possible while adhering to the guidelines of the essay prompt.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness of the argument presented.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay successfully discusses the problems associated with an aging population and suggests solutions. However, tying these solutions more directly to the problems they aim to address could strengthen the argument. Make sure each solution is clearly linked to a specific problem mentioned earlier in the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: 
    - Punctuation: Ensure there is a space after each punctuation mark and avoid using multiple punctuation marks together (e.g., "",...""). This rule helps in maintaining the readability of the essay.
    - Article Usage: Pay attention to the correct use of ""a"" and ""an"". Use ""an"" before words that start with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and ""a"" before words that start with consonants. For example, it should be ""an older person"" not ""a older person"".
    - Conjunctions: A comma should not be placed after conjunctions like 'and', 'but', etc. 
    - Vocabulary: Try to avoid using phrases like ""more and more"" excessively. Instead, use synonyms or rephrase to enrich your vocabulary and make the essay sound more academic.
    
3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your stance on the issue is clear, but expressing your opinions more confidently will enhance the impact of your essay. Avoid phrases that introduce doubt or uncertainty about your arguments.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
    - Descriptive arguments are used, but they could be developed further. For instance, when discussing the burden on healthcare systems, consider incorporating statistics or studies to back up your claim. This evidence makes your argument more convincing.
    - When suggesting solutions, explain how each solution can effectively address a particular problem. For example, explain how increasing the working age can alleviate specific issues related to an aging population.

Finally, remember that providing concrete examples, like the practices in Japan and Korea, helps in strengthening your arguments. However, ensure these examples are directly relevant and well-explained to show how they can be applied to address the issues discussed.

Although some disadvantages can be seen from the phenomenon, the advantages are more significant. \n Having a year off between high school and university presents several drawbacks. First, the knowledge can be forgot after one year without recall. Many students who come back university after one year off have some difficulties with the old knowledge in high school and the new knowledge in the university. They take more time than the students who go straight to university after high school in the beginning for pursuing university education. Second, the opportunities to get a job may be lost. The students who continue academic education after finishing high school will finish tertiary education earlier than the students who have a year off and they can get a permanent job with a stable incomes. \n However, those disadvantages above still cannot overshadow the advantages. First, a gap year before attending college will be a good time to save money for studying if you have difficulties with the university fees, or if you want to become an independent person, or if you want to share with your parents apart tuition. You can get a full time job or temporary job to work for saving money. Second, there are many good social skills that you can learn from this year. With a volunteer work, you will have a good chance to experience new experiences outside school and family environment to learn the skills. Third, one year off is a perfect moment to orient your future. Many people when finish high school, they do not know exactly what they desire for their lives, what major they will pursue. They just make a decision because that is the choice of their parents or their friends. One year off after finish high school likes a pause moment to see, to discern, to make a good orientation and to live. \n In conclusion, despite there are some disadvantages in term of knowledge and chance to get a job in university environment, the advantages are more worthy to consider. With the social experiences and a good orientation beside comfort about tuition will be a good preparation to build the future.","Dear student, I will give you some leeway and explain to you the various means by which you can improve your essay presentation in order to gain a decent overall score. We will have to go point by point on this so you have to read what I am saying and make sure you understand how to execute these instructions. \n First of all, when you write the prompt paraphrase, you must ensure that you are only delivering the correct information, as indicated in the original prompt. Your discussion of the original prompt is both lacking in sentence requirement (at least 3 sentences) and a proper representation of the prompt. The correct paraphrase for your prompt is: \n <em>There is an increase in the number of students taking a gap year between their secondary and tertiary education. This year long respite from education is said to have advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will be presenting one advantage and one disadvantage discussion stemming from the so-called year long ""academic leave"".</em> \n Since the prompt is not asking you to discuss each of the advantages and disadvantages, then it is enough that you offer an explanatory reason for each rather than changing the prompt as you did do indicate that one side of the discussion is more important than the other. The prompt is not requiring such a discussion and doing so shows that you did not fully understand the instructions for the discussion. This will force a lower TA score for you. \n You are also delivering less that stellar discussions per paragraph because you are forcing yourself to present 2 reasons, which you cannot fully explain because of the 5 sentence maximum requirement per paragraph. You actually end up going beyond the allowable maximum in your paragraphs because you present up to 9 sentences per paragraph. There is a one topic maximum requirement per paragraph. The single topic allows you to fully develop your discussion, rather than just presenting half baked and haphazard representations of reasons, which will end up garnering you a failing C&C score. \n The conclusion is also problematic since it doesn't follow the summary format for the closing paragraph presentation. The concluding paragraph is the same as the opening paragraph requirement with the only difference being that now, the concluding statement needs to summarize the discussion points instead of offering a thesis statement at the end of the paragraph.","The essay effectively discusses the topic of taking a year off between high school and university, outlining both its advantages and disadvantages. However, there are several areas that can be improved to enhance the overall quality and coherence of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay tends to favor one side by emphasizing the advantages over the disadvantages, which wasn't a requirement of the prompt. The prompt asks for a discussion on both aspects equally without implying a need to weigh one over the other. Focus on presenting both sides equally and refrain from indicating that one is more significant than the other unless explicitly stated in the question.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay demonstrates a reasonable control over language but is not without errors. For example, ""the knowledge can be forgot"" should be corrected to ""the knowledge can be forgotten"". Attention to verb tenses, agreement, and preposition use are areas for improvement. Aim for shorter, clearer sentences to avoid confusion and grammatical mistakes.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The point of view is clear but could be made more explicit by directly addressing the essay prompt in the introduction and conclusion. Ensure that the introduction paraphrases the prompt accurately and sets a neutral tone for the discussion that follows.

4. **Arguments and Supports:** The essay attempts to provide support for its claims, yet the elaboration on these points appears rushed and superficial. Due to trying to cover multiple reasons in one paragraph, the depth of explanation suffers. It's advised to focus on a single reason per paragraph, allowing for a more detailed and thoughtful exploration of each point. This approach will enable a fuller development of ideas within the constraints of paragraph length.

5. **Conclusion:** The closing paragraph needs to succinctly summarize the main points of the essay without introducing new information. Ensure it reflects upon what was discussed, tying the introduction and body paragraphs together cohesively.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Aim for a balanced discussion as per the prompt requirement without showing undue bias unless specified.
- Work on grammar and sentence structure to improve clarity and precision.
- Limit one main idea or reason per paragraph to allow for in-depth discussion and avoid exceeding sentence limits.
- Ensure the conclusion effectively summarizes the essay's main points without presenting new arguments.

The essay attempts to answer this but veers into discussing the broader effects of media rather than focusing specifically on tolerance for new ideas.

In terms of spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is relatively clear. However, there are some areas where improvements can make it stronger. For example, phrases like “it has also good and bad points” could be revised to “it has both good and bad points” for clarity. Additionally, some sentences are complex and difficult to follow, which could be simplified to make the argument clearer.

The point of view is stated, noting that the media has both positive and negative impacts. However, the essay does not explicitly state to what extent the writer agrees or disagrees with the initial statement about the media's influence on society's tolerance for new ideas. Clarifying this point of view at the beginning could strengthen the essay.

Regarding the arguments presented, they do offer evidence for both sides of the discussion. However, the connection to the specific issue of society's tolerance for new ideas could be made clearer. For instance, when discussing the spread of harmful thinking or the benefits of open-source projects, directly relate these points back to how they influence society's openness to new ideas.

To improve, the essay should:
1. Clearly state the extent of agreement or disagreement with the opinion that the media negatively influences society by hindering the acceptance of new ideas.
2. Simplify complex sentences to enhance clarity and readability.
3. Ensure that both positive and negative points are directly tied back to the essay's main argument about societal tolerance for new ideas.

Trying to be cool and loosening control of cigarette purchases are identified as the major reasons. Therefore, imposing taxes and money punishment in public places from government are introduced to address the issue. \n To start with, a majority of people smoke to impress others. This act can readily be found in teenagers these days, as they are usually influenced by other bad-influential peers. As a result, those naughty adolescents will begin getting access to cancer sticks from strangers to make themselves more awesome. Another reason is that tobacco prices are still affordable, compared to people's income. Therefore, they can still obtain cigarettes with a very low-cost amount of money. \n Governments should implement a long-term comprehensive legislation in order to combat against smoking. Raising taxes in cigarettes businesses is the first introduced suggestion because the cost of purchasing a cancer stick will be astronomical, so people are less likely to get it. The second solution is money penalization when catching an individual smoking in public. This method has been available in Singapore for many years, and it works effectively on the ground of its citizens' fear of being caught smoking.

You are proposing a prompt deviation in this paragraph which alters the rest of the discussion from simple reasons that young adults are fond of smoking to the results of smoking. Only reasons why adolescents are enticed to smoke should be presented in this essay. \n Learn to use transition sentences midstream so to create a more coherent presentation. For the first reasoning paragraph, I would have transitioned by saying; ""Aside from the negative influence of their peers, the affordability of cigarettes make smoking a cheap past-time for the youth....Considering the cheap price of cigarettes, the government should be involved in an effort to minimize smoking."" \n The above presentation uses 2 important elements in academic grammar writing: \n 1. The transition sentence in the middle that allows you to discuss 2 ideas in one paragraph rather than 1 topic per paragraph \n 2. The smooth transition into the next paragraph which introduces the next topic before the full discussion in order to prepare the reader for the change in discussion. \n This is one of your better and more improved attempts as Task 2 writing. I believe you have the potential to do better based on this exercise. Keep up the good work. You are getting close to a higher than simply passing score at this point.","The essay on reducing smoking in society addresses the topic and provides a clear point of view, which is a strong start. However, there are several areas that can be improved to enhance coherence, argument strength, and adherence to the topic. Here’s how:

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: It's important to stay focused on discussing smoking as a negative habit without delving into its health consequences like cancer. The essay should concentrate on why people, especially adolescents, continue to smoke despite its negative aspects. This focus helps prevent the discussion from veering off into health issues, which is beyond the scope of the given prompt.

2. **Clarity and Reasoning**: The reasons behind why people find it hard to quit smoking could be more clearly articulated. For example, the mention of people smoking to appear cool or the ease of access to cigarettes could be expanded upon with more reasoning. A suggested way to express this could be, “The major reasons people continue this negative habit, detrimental to their health, include attempting to impress peers and the minimal restrictions on cigarette purchases.”

3. **Use of Transition Sentences**: The essay would benefit significantly from smoother transitions between paragraphs and within paragraphs discussing multiple ideas. Transition sentences help link your thoughts and guide the reader through your argument. For example, when moving from discussing the influence of peers to the affordability of cigarettes, a transition like, “Aside from the negative influence of peers, the affordability of cigarettes makes smoking an accessible pastime for the youth,” would create a more coherent flow.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay is generally clear, attention to grammatical detail and stylistic choices could improve readability and professionalism. Ensure that each sentence contributes to your argument and check for correct punctuation and sentence structure.

5. **Descriptive Arguments and Solutions**: The solutions provided, such as raising taxes and penalizing smoking in public places, are relevant. It would strengthen the essay to further elaborate on how these measures could be implemented and why they would be effective, with possible references to examples where similar approaches have seen success.

6. **Conclusion Improvements**: The conclusion summarizes the main points well but could be enhanced by more directly linking back to the question and the importance of the proposed solutions in reducing smoking in society. A restatement of the key reasons for smoking and a stronger emphasis on the role of governmental measures could make for a more compelling ending.

This essay shows a good understanding of the task and presents valid points. With focus on clearer reasoning, smoother transitions between ideas, and a tighter focus on the topic, the essay can be significantly improved. Keep up the effort, as there is clear potential for even better performance.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position. \n *** \n A city is considerable as representative of a country or a region. With its complexity due to dense population from various background, a city could describes the characteristic of its country or its region. It is tempting to believe that the characteristic of a society will be comprehensively understood when we conduct a deeper research on its major cities. \n Furthermore, all great civilizations have had a flourishing cities. The government/king/queen have been living here. To understand most of its people, the way in which it is ruled, we must understand the city. In addition, cities have most of qualified universities and jobs which contribute to economic aspect and prosperity of society. \n With these evidences, it is easy to believe that by studying the city, the characteristic of a society will be easily concluded. However, I argue that how the way society live its life is not as simply as knowing the life of its city. Moreover, in a developed countries, there is a huge inequality of many aspects. For example, Indonesia has a largest archipelago with its huge variation of tribes, cultures, beliefs, etc. The cities in Indonesia only represent few of Indonesian people. The most population have been agricultural, and many rituals can only be understood in the context of a rural backdrop. \n So, while there are arguments that city is the best area for studying a society, it is clear that there is a wiser way to put rural background as main aspects in assessing a society, especially for developing or low-income countries.","Nuradia, you have a lack of control when it comes to using the English language during your presentation. You need to familiarize yourself more with the general descriptive words that are used in the English language so that you do not use unnecessary markings such as backslashes (e.g. government / king / queen) when a simple term such as ""the seat of power"" would have sufficed. \n There is also a lack of clarity in your discussion because, all the while, I thought you were agreeing with the statement based on the majority of your discussion presentation. Then it turns out that you were not in agreement with the discussion provided. Your essay should have focused on that opinion because that is your personal opinion that disagrees with the given statement. This is not a comparative essay. This is a direct personal opinion discussion based on the prompt you were provided. \n What you should have done was relate your actual opinion and then, thought of the contradictions to your belief that you could have countered in the discussion. The point of this essay is to debate yourself. Look for the loopholes in your discussion and then defend it. Doing so would have boosted your score to a 5. Right now, you are between a 3 and 4 due to the problems that are present in your discussion and presentation.","Your essay attempts to address the prompt by examining whether studying major cities provides a comprehensive understanding of a society's characteristics. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make your argument more effective and your writing clearer.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity of Opinion**: Your essay initially suggests agreement with the statement that studying major cities can help understand a society's characteristics. However, later, you express disagreement, stating that cities do not fully represent a society, especially in developing countries. This shift can be confusing. It's essential to clearly state your position early in the essay and consistently support that viewpoint throughout. Instead of seeming to compare two sides, focus on presenting and supporting your own opinion, as this will make your argument more direct and persuasive.

2. **Language and Grammar**: Your essay demonstrates issues with grammar and the choice of expressions. For example, using slashes (e.g., government/king/queen) is not standard in formal English writing. Instead, use general terms that encompass all possibilities you want to imply, such as ""the seat of power."" This will make your essay sound more professional. Also, pay attention to sentence structure to ensure your writing is clear and easy to follow.

3. **Supporting Arguments and Examples**: While you provide reasons and examples to support your viewpoint, such as mentioning Indonesia's diversity, these could be developed further for greater impact. Specific, detailed examples help strengthen your argument. Also, exploring contradictions to your viewpoint and addressing them could deepen your discussion, making your position stronger and more nuanced.

4. **Spelling and Stylistic Issues**: There are some spelling mistakes and awkward phrasings in your essay. For instance, ""a city is considerable as representative"" could be changed to ""a city can be considered representative."" Take time to proofread your work carefully or use tools to check for grammar and spelling errors. This will help improve the overall readability of your essay.

To improve, focus on stating your position clearly at the beginning, use formal and correct English, enhance your arguments with specific examples, and address any potential counterarguments.

Do you agree or disagree? \n Answer: \n Some countries introduce a rule banning smoking in the public places and those willing to have some smokes should leave the related spot. This essay would completely agree with this statement because this policy would create a clean environment and people are hindered from being contaminated with the dangerous smoke released by burned cigarette. \n It is generally believed that government authority has aim to prohibit smokers to burn cigarette in public zones to get fresh air in these circumstances. The reason for this policy is smoking activities will produce smoke everywhere and will pollute air surrounding the public areas which many people always pass this common zone. For example, in 2005, a recent study carried out by Dubai government found that air condition around public places were polluted around 56% in Airport and 78% in convention hall. It is true that this regulation brings positive impact to make inhabitants respire with fresh air. \n On the other hand, this policy will also halt citizens who are passive smoking from contaminated by smokers in public places. The reason for this is that will lessen the number of diseases which is infected by smokers to citizens. For instance, a recent survey, carried out by the Japan public health, showed in 2010 about 68% patients breast cancer decreased to 45% since the government issued rule to not allow smokers burn cigarette in public place. It is needless to say that this regulation will increase life expectancy for passive smokers. \n To sum up, it is gone without seeing that people who want to burn cigarette have to find smoking areas based on the government regulation because this rule will make a clean circumstance and give benefit for passive smokers.

So in the end, the score for this essay would not have been beneficial to your chances of studying overseas.","Your essay addresses the topic of smoking bans in public places and presents arguments in favor of such regulations. You've made efforts to support your position with evidence and examples, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to align more closely with the essay prompt and improve overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears there was some misunderstanding of the specific question posed by the prompt. The question asks for an opinion on whether it is fair for individuals wishing to smoke to leave the building, focusing on fairness and personal inconvenience rather than the broader implications of government regulations on public health. In revising your essay, try to directly address whether you agree or disagree with the idea that smokers should step outside to smoke and why, connecting your reasoning more closely to the question of fairness.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally understandable but would benefit from addressing some grammatical inconsistencies and phrasing issues. For instance, consider revising phrases like “those willing to have some smokes should leave the related spot” to “individuals wishing to smoke should leave the building or designated area.” This adjustment not only clarifies your point but also aligns with more standard English usage. Additionally, watch for sentence structure to ensure each sentence flows logically into the next, providing clear and coherent argumentation throughout.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your stance in support of the ban on smoking in public places is clear, which is a strength of your essay. For improvement, explicitly state your perspective on the specific issue of fairness related to smokers having to leave a building to smoke. Directly addressing the prompt will strengthen your argument and make your point of view even clearer to the reader.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You have included data and examples to support your position, which is excellent. To further enhance your essay, consider directly tying these examples to the specific question of fairness and the inconvenience faced by smokers. For example, discussing how the benefits to public health and the environment outweigh the inconvenience experienced by smokers could strengthen your argument. 

In summary, focus on closely addressing the specific question posed by the prompt, refining your grammar and phrasing for clarity, and ensuring your arguments directly support your viewpoint regarding the fairness of requiring smokers to leave the building. By making these adjustments, your essay will become more effective and directly answer the question asked, improving its overall quality.",3,4,4,2,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

Online shopping, therefore, becomes more popular than ever, originally from books to even daily groceries. In my opinion, their advantages definitely beyond the disadvantages. \n On the one hand, there are some drawbacks that prevent people from buying things online. The first reason is the feeling. They cannot touch, smell, or try on carefully before making the decisions. This can lead to unsatisfied when the goods are delivered. Secondly, the fraud will be another problem that could occur. There will happen the circumstance that the sellers do not deliver the product after receiving money. The shopper will be tricked for money by the unreal products. \n On the other hand, the advantages of this new shopping way are more weighted. The first benefit that can be easily seen is convenience. By only several clicks or touch, people can buy anything from books, clothes, tools, or even food without going out. By this way, people can save a lot of time traveling to the stores, especially benefit for busy people. For example, people can now sit in their homes with the pizza will be served at their place about thirty minutes after some clicks. Secondly, online shopping platforms can provide a wide range of products with many suppliers. They sell everything as in the physical stores. People can easily find their needs and compare the price among sellers quickly before making the decision. These advantages absolutely surpass the inconveniences. \n In conclusion, although online shopping still remains some drawbacks, it now becomes more and more popular, I am of the opinion that the advantages are outweighed.","The main problem that I see with your presentation pertains mostly to your grammar. You need to learn to use verbs in order to create a sentence that makes sense to the examiner. For example: \n ... their advantages definitely beyond the disadvantages. \n - the advantages need an action word to complete the description so: ... their advantages definitely OUTWEIGH the disadvantages. \n or \n ... their advantages definitely GO beyond the disadvantages \n You also need to use subjects when presenting verbs: \n ... They cannot touch, smell, or try on carefully before making the decisions. \n - try on what? What is the subject of that reference? clothes? perfume? shoes? The sentence thought process is incomplete. \n Error in vocabulary usage: \n ... clicks or touch... \n - Clicks would have been sufficient. Touch doesn't do anything to the screen unless you click or tap on it. \n Now, for a more coherent explanation of the advantage v. disadvantage, your presentation would have been stronger if you had actually taken the disadvantage discussion points and proven why these disadvantages are actually advantages. It would have created a more cohesive and coherent presentation as all of the discussion points, positive and negative would have all connected to the same subject. So, to write this essay, you should have first outlined: \n <em>Disadvantage: Non- physical Shopping - lack of physical contact with the item, possible mistakes in item delivery, payment fraud<br/>Advantage: Health precautions: non-exposure to viruses, bacteria, and germs (reference Covid 19 new normal shopping guidelines. It shows your understanding of current events in relation to the given topic) . Saves time because a person can shop from anywhere (even at work), items are delivered to the client's home allowing the buyer to do other things with his or her time. People can easily shop and compare items without having to physically go from store to store.</em> \n Properly outlining the essay by looking for the connected advantages and disadvantages of the same topic, you create a clear analysis of the discussion and present fully developed reasoning presentations using both sides of the same topic. Always aim to connect reason 1 with reason 2. That way, the essay comes across as fully developed and explained to the examiner. \n Your conclusion is incomplete. Kindly review the reverse paraphrase requirements and apply it to the next essay. The reverse paraphrase needs: \n - A topic restatement \n - Advantage reason (summarized) \n - Disadvantage reason ( summarized) \n - Closing opinion \n Your essay is actually good, but it could have been better. The second paragraph could have used more appropriate discussion development.","The essay effectively addresses the topic of online shopping, highlighting its advantages and disadvantages. However, there is room for improvement in several areas to make the essay stronger and more coherent.

Firstly, the use of grammar needs attention. Verbs are essential for creating clear and meaningful sentences. For instance, ""their advantages definitely beyond the disadvantages"" requires an action verb to be complete. A correct version could be ""their advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages"" or ""their advantages definitely go beyond the disadvantages."" This will make your arguments clearer and more persuasive.

Additionally, clarity in your sentences can be improved by specifying the subjects in your statements. For example, in the sentence ""They cannot touch, smell, or try on carefully before making the decisions,"" it would be helpful to specify what the subject is trying on. This detail adds precision and depth to your argumentation.

Regarding vocabulary, be mindful of word choice for clarity and accuracy, such as preferring ""clicks"" over ""clicks or touch."" The correct term enriches the sentence and avoids confusion, making your argument stronger.

To enhance the cohesiveness and coherence of your essay, consider directly contrasting the disadvantages with the advantages on the same points. This approach allows for a more integrated and thorough discussion of the topic. By directly addressing how certain disadvantages could be seen as advantages in different contexts (e.g., health precautions during a pandemic, saving time, comparing options easily), your essay would present a more nuanced perspective.

Regarding the structure of your essay and the development of ideas, outlining your points can significantly improve the flow and completeness of your arguments. Connecting disadvantages and advantages related to the same aspect of online shopping can provide a more detailed and compelling analysis.

Your conclusion could be strengthened by employing a reverse paraphrase. This includes restating the topic, summarizing the reasons for advantages and disadvantages, and reaffirming your closing opinion. A comprehensive conclusion leaves a strong final impression.

In summary, by focusing on using verbs correctly, specifying subjects, choosing accurate vocabulary, connecting disadvantages and advantages, and crafting a complete conclusion, your essay will be more coherent, persuasive, and engaging. You have made good points about the popularity and benefits of online shopping; refining your essay with these suggestions will make your argumentation even stronger.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, history as well as science subjects play the equal important role in our life. The main purpose of this essay is to discuss both sides of this argument and give the reasons behind my opinion. \n The first and foremost, history is appreciated because it helps students develop their patriotism and have thorough insight into historical problems. For example, Vietnamese students are taught about the historical highlights in Viet Nam like the war and many great figures who sacrificed because of the peace and independence of their country. In addition, the young generation can understand how their ancestors escape from colonization. Therefore, students would take pride in their origin and have the responsibility to protect and improve their country in the future. \n On the other hand, I advocate those who believe that subjects like technology and science are more crucial than history. Nowadays, the advance of technology gives the young generation many opportunities to get a good job with the high income. Due to the diversity of career opportunity, students put more emphasis on studying these subjects. For instance, data analyst is one of the highly paid careers and also recruited by many companies. \n In conclusion, both history and science subjects have own importance. While history helps people enhance their understanding about the ups and downs of their country, science subjects give them a career opportunity.

It is the thesis statement that does that through TA compliance. \n There is a problem in the reasoning presentation though. While the first presentation is general enough, the lack of third person pronoun usage implies this is a personal statement rather than an insight into the public point of view. Another problem is that the general discussion of the second reason is missing. You went directly to your point of view. This will cause a lower, possibly non-passing score. This will be due to the missing 2nd public discussion point. Read the instructions carefully. It asks you to : \n <quotation>Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.</quotation> \n That instruction is indicative of a 3 paragraph comparison essay. \n While the discussion is relevant and partially on-point, you have to make sure that you use the correct discussion format to boost the all important TA score and, the C+ C presentation for clarity purposes in relation to the prompt.","Your essay smartly engages with a significant topic, reflecting on the importance of studying both history and science subjects. However, to further enhance your essay and ensure it fully aligns with English proficiency test standards, some areas could use improvement. Here's how to strengthen your essay:

1. **Direct Response to the Topic:** You've touched upon the essence of the topic by discussing the relevance of history and science subjects. Nonetheless, to clarify your stance, it's advisable not to restate the essay prompt or mention that you will discuss both views. Instead, jump straight into presenting your views. Your introduction could benefit from a stronger thesis statement that directly states your opinion, setting a clear direction for your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay is generally well-written, but watch for minor grammatical errors and ensure consistency in tense and voice. For example, using third-person pronouns (such as ""one,"" ""students,"" or ""people"") can help make your arguments feel more universal and less subjective. Also, avoid repeating phrases like ""the important level of subjects"" which can be simplified to ""the importance of subjects"" for clarity.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view comes across, yet it's somewhat merged with the discussion of both sides. To make it stand out, explicitly summarize your viewpoint in the conclusion, restating why you believe balancing history and science subjects is vital. This reaffirms your stance to the reader.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** You've provided examples and reasons why both history and science are important; however, your essay would benefit from a more structured approach to discussing these points. Aim for a clear separation between paragraphs that deal with different views. Specifically, after presenting each view, you could further discuss the general public opinion before sharing your standpoint. This would align your essay closer to the prompt's instructions and ensure a balanced discussion.

Remember, each paragraph should ideally focus on one main idea. Begin with a topic sentence, followed by explanations, examples, and finally, a sentence that ties back to your overall argument. 

In conclusion, enhancing your essay's structure, clarifying your thesis statement, and refining your grammar and style will drastically improve its impact. Your final conclusion does a commendable job of summarizing your opinion, yet reinforcing it with a concise recap of the supporting arguments could make it even more compelling.

Please remember that the essay is speaking in terms of the present hence your time reference should also be in the present. terms such as ""...increasingly was catching on"" should be written as ""increasingly catching on."" with the -ing part signifying that this practice is still ongoing. Additionally, the paraphrase is faulty because you are being asked if this is a positive or negative development and rather than saying ""positive"" or ""negative"" you claim ""potential impacts"" instead. Which does not respond to the question in the original prompt. \n Your reasoning paragraphs are incorrect as well because this is a single opinion, not a comparison essay. That is evidenced by the ""OR"" selection for the positive or negative effects of the given discussion. As such, you have failed to properly discuss the given discussion based on the required presentation coming from the instructions. \n Therefore, aside from the problematic grammar presentation, there is also an English comprehension problem involved. You need to brush up on your English comprehension lessons so you can develop your ability to understand English sentences better. Try reading English based comic books that have the comic panels showing the reader exactly what the dialogue in the instruction is showing. That is one way of better understanding the English sentences in reference to action statements. Action statements in the Task 2 essay can be interpreted as the discussion instruction so you should be able to develop your understanding of the English instructions using that method of reading practice.","The essay discusses the impacts of package tours to distant and mountainous areas on local economies and environments. However, there are several aspects that require improvement for clarity and relevance to the topic.

1. **Topic Response:** The initial statement is confusing and needs to be more direct and relevant to the assigned topic. It should clearly state whether these developments are viewed positively or negatively from the start. The essay is meant to express a single opinion rather than comparing both sides. Focus on arguing for one side of the issue as required by the prompt.

2. **Time Reference and Consistency:** The essay should consistently use the present tense to discuss current trends, such as ""increasingly catching on,"" which indicates that this is an ongoing phenomenon. This will help maintain clarity and relevance.

3. **Grammar and Style:** There are several grammatical and stylistic issues throughout the essay. For example, phrases like ""package-tours is created"" and ""benefits is hugely bring"" are grammatically incorrect. These should be corrected to ""package tours are created"" and ""hugely bring benefits,"" respectively. Paying attention to subject-verb agreement and sentence construction will enhance the readability of your essay. Using simpler language could also help in making your arguments clearer and more direct.

4. **Clarity of Argument:** Your essay presents both benefits and downsides to package tours. However, the structure and argumentation need to be clearer. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea and provide specific examples to support your views. Moreover, ensure that your arguments are relevant to whether this trend has a positive or negative impact overall, as per the essay prompt.

5. **Understanding and Comprehension:** It seems there might be some difficulties in fully understanding the task requirements and expressing your thoughts in English. Improving English comprehension might help in better addressing such essay prompts in the future. Consider engaging with English material that pairs text with visuals, like comic books, to enhance your understanding of action statements and instructions.

To improve your essay, consider reorganizing your thoughts to clearly state your position on the topic right from the introduction. Simplify your language to avoid complex sentences that can lead to grammatical errors. Finally, ensure each paragraph supports your main argument with clear, understandable examples.

The personal opinion is never presented as a concluding statement as that paragraph is meant to simply summarize the discussion points in a manner similar to the opening paraphrase.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on whether the primary goal of university education is to secure better job opportunities for graduates or if it contributes broader benefits to both individuals and society. As for offering feedback, there are several key points to consider for improving this essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to address the given topic but doesn't start with a clear paraphrase of the prompt, which is essential for setting the stage for your discussion. It’s crucial to begin your essay with a brief paraphrase of the essay prompt to show you understand what's being asked before diving into your argument. This helps frame your discussion and makes it easier for readers to follow your line of reasoning.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: The essay is relatively clear, though there are minor issues with grammar and style, such as subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""an university"" should be ""a university""), and some punctuation errors. Pay close attention to these elements since they can disrupt the flow and clarity of your argument. Improving sentence structure and ensuring correct grammar usage will enhance the overall readability of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your position becomes clear towards the end of the introduction and is reiterated in the conclusion. However, embedding your personal opinion more distinctly as a separate paragraph after discussing both viewpoints would strengthen the essay structure and clarity. The essay should methodically present both perspectives, followed by your well-developed personal stance, before summarizing these discussions in the conclusion.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions Supporting the Position**: The arguments provided are relevant and support the viewpoints discussed. However, they could be enhanced by including more specific examples and evidence. For instance, when mentioning the development of self-discipline and social skills, illustrative examples of how these are achieved and their direct impact on society could make your arguments more convincing. 

Additionally, it’s important to distinguish between the presentation of general viewpoints and your own opinion within the body of the essay. Structuring your essay into a more formal format with an introduction that paraphrases the prompt, three body paragraphs (each dedicated to discussing one of the views and your own opinion), followed by a conclusion that summarizes without introducing new opinions, would align better with the expectations for this task.

In conclusion, revising the essay to include a clear paraphrase of the prompt at the beginning, separating your opinion into its own paragraph, correcting minor grammatical and stylistic issues, and providing more detailed examples would greatly improve the effectiveness of your argumentation and overall clarity. Keep practicing your essay structure and pay close attention to task requirements for a stronger presentation of your ideas.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

And how it influence our children?,"Television is one of the most wonderful inventions of human. We can learn a lot from a television. However, new surveys suggest that the TV we use to make our life easier are killing our leisure time. Therefore, some people say watching TV is waste of time for children because of many reasons. \n Firstly, they become highly addicted to watching TV which leads to lots of health problems such as headache, backache, and falling eye sights. They are working shorter hours, taking fewer activities. They may easily get access to the harmful things on TV like people usually do on horror or action or violent films. It is dangerous for children . As a result, the productivity and efficiency im work or study of kids who usually watch TV are not high. Thus, children will have poor concentration on their work or study and often distract their duties. \n Secondly, it cannot help children get more living skills because they are always sitting in front of the television and do not do anything. Consequently, they do not go outside, they will not have many chances to expose their feelings or presenting their ideas in public. Some skills such as team spirit, creativity, problem solving, cognitive, and social skills are not gained. For example, instead sitting in front of the TV, what about going outside and make friend or go for a walk with the family,.. The problem is that children do not have wisdom to discriminate between what is good or bad for them. They can compromise their sleeping hours to watch their favourite shows or films. They can also neglect their household chores or homework.. \n However, in fact, some people say television has both drawbacks and advantages. Children can watch some channels to know more the present affairs of the world. They can learn more lessons in a fun way by watching special shows for children. TV is very important for human. Everything contains good side and bad side, and the television has no exception. Children should spend little time watching TV and take part in more activities. \n In summary, although it has many drawbacks, we try our best to reduce them and make it better for children. \n ---- Anatasia aka @lamphuongta -----","Dear student, I wish you had provided me with the complete and original prompt requirement for this essay. It appears within your discussion that you had a prompt deviation from the end. At first, it seemed like you were discussing the disadvantages of television watching in children. Then towards the end, you mentioned a different prompt requirement which is the drawbacks and advantages. Which is which? What was the original prompt really asking you to discuss? This confusion in the actual thesis statement of your essay can cause a lower points consideration for your work. \n Be careful of your vocabulary and spelling. There is no such term as ""addicerd"". I believe the term you wanted to use was ""addicted"". Carelessness in your spelling and sentence formation will result in difficult to understand sentences, which in turn, will translate into points deductions on your part. You also said ""im work"" instead of ""in work"". That is another example of careless writing that will turn your essay into a useless essay. \n Your punctuation is also faulty as you have a line in the 3rd paragraph where you have a comma followed by ellipses. What exactly were you going for? A comma and a continued discussion or a period and a new discussion? These small errors are slowly adding up to lead towards a failing score in your essay. I could go on and on with more references to your mistakes in this essay but I just need to give you a general idea of where your problem points are so that you can focus on improving those sections in your next round of practice essays.","Your essay provides an interesting discussion on the impact of television on children, focusing on both its disadvantages and potential benefits. However, there are several areas where improvements could be made to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness of your argument. Below are specific points of feedback to guide your revisions:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay begins with a strong focus on the negative aspects of television for children but introduces the idea of television's advantages towards the end. It's important to clearly define the scope of your essay from the beginning. If the prompt asked for both pros and cons, make sure to introduce this comparison early on and maintain a balanced discussion throughout. If the focus was solely on the disadvantages, then stick to that topic for coherence.

2. **Spelling and Grammar:** Pay close attention to spelling and grammar. Errors such as ""addicerd"" instead of ""addicted"" and ""im work"" instead of ""in work"" can detract from the professionalism of your essay and make it harder for readers to understand your points. Consider using spell check tools and carefully proofreading your work to catch these mistakes.

3. **Punctuation:** Review the use of punctuation in your essay. For instance, combining a comma with ellipses can confuse readers about your intended punctuation and disrupt the flow of your writing. Ensure each sentence has clear and correct punctuation to enhance readability and maintain a formal tone.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** While you provide several arguments against watching TV, such as health issues and the lack of development of social skills, these points could be strengthened with more specific examples or data. Also, when mentioning the benefits of television, offer clearer examples of how TV can be educational or beneficial for learning and development. This will create a more balanced and persuasive argument.

5. **Point of View:** Your conclusion suggests a shift towards finding a balanced approach to television for children, which is a valid perspective. However, clarify this standpoint earlier in the essay to provide a consistent thread throughout your discussion. This will help in creating a cohesive argument that aligns with the prompt.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the structure, clarity, and persuasiveness of your essay. Remember that writing is a process, and each revision brings you closer to effectively communicating your thoughts and ideas.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

This essay will discuss both sides of this trend. \n On the one hand, taking a sabbatical year before university is proved to be beneficial to youngsters in various aspects. Firstly, despite having finished twelve years of compulsory education, there are always a lot of students who still have no clue about their future careers. Therefore, it is advisable to have a year off to engage in a wide range of different activities, from volunteering to picking up part-time jobs, which may help students to discover where their interests lie, what their talents are, and how they should use them to benefit the community. Secondly, a gap year is also regarded as one of the most precious opportunities for teenagers to enjoy their youth. Adolescents can spend this period tightening their bond with their beloved ones, going on long-term trips, as well as doing whatever things they have always been longing for. In this way, they may compensate for the past twelve consecutive years of struggling with their obligation of studying. \n On the other hand, gap-year takers must consider several potential drawbacks. Firstly, attending universities one year later might put students at risk of falling behind their friends who go to universities right after high school graduation. Consequently, they are more likely to suffer from peer pressure, which may have a detrimental impact on their mental well-being. Secondly, extended traveling during a gap year can be highly expensive. As a result of this, teenagers will inevitably have to live on a tight budget when they enter university life. \n In conclusion, it is always a universal truth that everything has its two sides, and taking a gap year is no exception. Therefore, it is advisable for students to take all the pros and cons into their consideration before deciding whether a gap year is essential to them. \n -------------------------------------------------------","The prompt restatement is acceptable and serves its purpose of delivering an originally worded version of the original topic. However, the writer's opinion, which is scored along with the prompt restatement cannot be found in the introductory paragraph. There are 2 reasons why this is a problem: \n 1. It does not offer the discussional foundation for the writer's opinion. \n 2. It does not provide a summary of topics for the upcoming 2 discussion paragraphs. \n Both of these are criteria that will help the examiner give the writer a preliminary score based on task accuracy and opinion clarity. Without it, the writer is clearly missing the writer's opinion requirement in the first paragraph. \n <quotation>twelve years of compulsory education</quotation> \n Use only general references to an academic study period. Different countries have different study years for the elementary and secondary years. Keep it general to create the idea that you are not referring to any specific study term for students. \n The reasoning paragraphs are not balanced in terms of discussion presentation. One would consider the advantages paragraph to be better developed that the disadvantages paragraph. Try to keep a balance within the presentation. Use only 5 sentences at the most to discuss each aspect. Learn to create connected discussions in each paragraph so that the balance can be achieved. It is when the reasons are discussed individually that these imbalance in presentations occur. \n As for the concluding summary. It is definitely a conclusion but it is missing the summary of the previous discussion points. It has to present the topic reasons to create the correct reverse paraphrase requirement. That means, the writer has an acceptable, but not well scoring concluding paragraph in this case.","The essay provides a straightforward discussion on the topic of taking a gap year before pursuing higher education, addressing both its benefits and drawbacks. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, structure, and persuasiveness.

1. **Introduction & Thesis Statement**: The introduction briefly mentions the topic but lacks a clear thesis statement expressing the author's own perspective. Including a sentence that clearly states the essay's stance on taking a gap year would improve both the focus and the structure of the essay. This will also set a foundation for the discussion and give a brief preview of the points that will be covered.

2. **Precision and Universality**: The reference to ""twelve years of compulsory education"" is specific and might not apply to all countries, as the length of compulsory education varies worldwide. To ensure the essay resonates with a broader audience, it's recommended to use more general terminology when referring to pre-university education.

3. **Balanced Argumentation**: There’s a noticeable imbalance in the development of the paragraphs discussing the advantages and disadvantages of taking a gap year. The section on the benefits is more comprehensive than the one on the drawbacks. Aim for parity by equally developing each side of the argument, potentially limiting the discussion to a set number of sentences for each point. This approach not only maintains balance but also encourages concise and focused argumentation.

4. **Conclusion**: While the conclusion succeeds in reaffirming the essay’s main points, it falls short of summarizing the discussion effectively. A stronger conclusion would revisit the key arguments presented in favor of and against taking a gap year, thereby offering a more rounded recap before stating the final stance. This will not only tie the essay together but also reinforce the points made, enhancing the reader's understanding of the author's perspective.

5. **Grammar and Style**: The essay is largely well-written but vigilance is required to avoid minor grammatical and stylistic errors. Ensuring correct punctuation, verb tense consistency, and sentence structure can further polish the essay.

Incorporating these suggestions will make the argument more compelling, the structure more coherent, and the presentation more balanced. Emphasizing a clear thesis, ensuring balanced argumentation, and summarizing key points in the conclusion are fundamental steps toward crafting a well-rounded essay.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

You can keep fit and improve your health by playing sports such as: swimming, playing football or any other sport activities else. You can improve your teamwork skills, too. Furthermore, paying for sport costs you less than for going to a concert or movie theatre. Therefore, how to spend your time on cultural activities or sport is based on your ability of money and your free time. The best choice is to have a balance of both these activities, because it will help you have not only a healthy body but also a beautiful mind.","If you were to pass this essay in the actual test, it would get a failing score. Since you did not write 250 words, the essay will automatically fail to achieve a passing task requirement score and, based on additional errors, the overall score cannot reach the minimum 5 band mark.

As of now, I will consider this a first timer's essay writing exercise. I will wait for your second essay on a different topic that meets the minimum word count. I will review that work instead. Here is a tip, aim to write 275-290 words. You will always receive maximum scoring consideration in all aspects when you write the appropriate number of words, and if you do some self-editing within the 40 minute time allowance.","Your essay addresses the topic of the importance of cultural activities and sports in modern life, offering perspectives on how these activities contribute to relaxation, enjoyment, health, and skills development. The essay's strength lies in presenting clear opinions on the benefits of both cultural activities and sports, indicating an understanding of the topic and an ability to engage with the subject matter.

However, there are several areas for improvement to better meet the English proficiency test requirements and to strengthen your essay overall:

1. **Length and Structure**: The essay does not meet the typical word count requirement of 250 words for such tests. Expanding your essay to include more detailed examples and analyses would not only help meet word count requirements but also enrich your arguments. Adding an introductory paragraph to restate the prompt and a concluding paragraph to summarize your main points and reflect on the topic would greatly improve the structure and flow of your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Watch out for minor grammatical mistakes and aim for variety in sentence structure to make your writing more engaging and polished. For instance, you could enhance clarity and coherence by careful selection of linking words and by making agreements in number (""playing sports also has advantages"" instead of ""have advantages""). 

3. **Arguments and Descriptions**: Your essay briefly mentions the benefits of cultural activities and sports, yet it would benefit from more detailed examples and explanations. Describe specific experiences or studies that highlight the impacts of these activities on individuals' lives. This will strengthen your position and make your arguments more persuasive.

4. **Clarity of Point of View**: While your essay suggests a balanced view of cultural activities and sports, clarifying and expanding on this perspective with more reasoned arguments and personal reflections could make your stance more compelling. For example, discussing why a balance between the two is beneficial from a personal or societal viewpoint could add depth to your essay.

To improve your writing and better prepare for English proficiency tests, consider aiming for a word count of 275-290 words. This not only ensures you meet the minimum requirements but also allows room for more thorough development of your ideas. Additionally, allotting time for self-editing within the allocated timeframe for the test can greatly enhance the quality of your essay.

However, to improve clarity and effectiveness, consider the following points:

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's imperative to ensure that your essay clearly aligns with the specified topic. In this case, focusing more specifically on activities, experiences, or personal development that occurred in the gap year after high school graduation but before college would enhance relevance. Mentioning earlier experiences or activities might slightly detract from the essay's focus on the gap year. Try to concentrate on what you did in this specific period to address the essay topic more directly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your essay is mostly clear, but there are a few areas where grammar and style could be improved for better readability. For instance, consider revising the sentence structure for smoother flow and clearer meaning. Avoid long sentences that might confuse readers. Also, pay attention to punctuation, such as the use of commas and periods, to ensure sentences are properly separated and ideas don't run into each other.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your perspective comes through strongly in the essay, showcasing resilience and determination. To enhance this further, explicitly stating your viewpoints and feelings about each experience can make your narrative even more powerful. Using the first person effectively communicates your personal journey, but ensure every experience is tied back to how it contributed to your growth.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position**: You've outlined several significant experiences, but elaborating on how each specifically contributed to overcoming struggles or achieving personal growth would strengthen your essay. For example, when discussing working to support your family or engaging in community service, detail how these experiences shaped your understanding, skills, or outlook. Providing more descriptive arguments and examples can help the reader fully grasp the impact of your experiences.

Additionally, if there are certain topics you're uncomfortable discussing or feel are off-topic, it's okay to exclude them or mention them only if they directly relate to your personal development during the gap year. Focusing on how you utilized the gap year, particularly in developing new skills or passions, would offer a clearer and more cohesive narrative.

In summary, focusing on gap-year experiences, refining the essay's structure and grammar, clearly expressing your viewpoint, and providing detailed support for your assertions can significantly enhance your essay.

However, some people think that young people are still dependent their parents like as the before. These people who think young people are still dependent their parents have some aspects such as economic dependence and constant cultural values. \n Firstly, the main reason why young people are still dependent their relatives is economic dependence. Young people study at high school or university. They need money to take care of themselves. However, they have a busy schedule and challenging lessons their school life, and even they want to earn money harshly they could not make money because of their busy schedule and hard lessons. So that, they should take money from their parents. For instance, a student who is studying medicine away from her home country needs money to make a living. She cannot work any job because of her busy schedule. Her family help her to study so that she will depend on her parents. \n Secondly, another reason why young people still depend on their parents is constant cultural values. All countries have various cultural values about different subjects. Individuals who have cultural values teach children their cultural values on children's earlier lives. Children grow with their cultural values. Consequently, they will have the same opinion about different subjects like their parents have. For instance, a person who raises with the idea that we should pray before eating for gratitude God will continue to pray after he left the homeland. He will still depend on his parent's belief. \n As a result, some people think that young people still depend on their parents. These people have strong points such as economic dependence and constant cultural values.

However, there are several crucial areas where improvements are needed to meet the requirements of the essay prompt and to enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Prompt:** The essay begins by introducing the topic but fails to clearly state a position in agreement or disagreement with the statement provided in the essay prompt. For an English proficiency test essay, it's essential to explicitly express your stance on the topic at the end of the introduction. This forms the thesis statement, which guides the direction of the essay. To improve, the essay should start with a clear statement of whether you agree or disagree with the premise that young people today are better at making decisions for themselves compared to the past.

2. **Language and Grammar Issues:** The essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that can confuse readers and detract from the message. For example, ""young people are still dependent their parents like as the before"" could be corrected to ""young people are still dependent on their parents as before."" Paying close attention to verb tenses, prepositions, and article use (a, an, the) will greatly enhance readability and coherence. Additionally, simplifying complex sentences may help in conveying arguments more clearly.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay leans towards discussing why young people are still dependent on their parents but doesn't make a clear argument in support of or against the original statement. A clearer and more direct expression of personal opinion will strengthen the essay. Identifying and consistently supporting one side of the argument throughout the essay is crucial.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** The essay provides two main reasons for young people's dependency on their parents: economic dependence and cultural values. These points are relevant but require more detailed explanation and evidence to be compelling. For example, offering specific statistics, real-life examples, or comparative analysis between past and present could enrich the argument. Moreover, directly tying these reasons back to the essay's initial stance will help in maintaining a focused argument.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Begin with a clear thesis statement that reflects your position in response to the essay prompt.
- Carefully proofread to correct grammatical and spelling errors and rephrase awkward sentences for clarity.
- Make sure the point of view is consistently presented throughout the essay, clearly indicating whether you agree or disagree with the prompt.
- Provide more detailed examples and explanations to bolster your arguments, ensuring they directly support your thesis.

Reasons and solutions?,"------------------------ \n I was wondered when I read the recent survey about the interest in the youngsters reading newspapers or watch the news. The survey reported that in many countries 70 percent of youth are not showing interest neither to read nor to watch the news. Only 30 percent are willing to read or watch the news. \n In my view, one of the major reasons for lack of interest in the youth is they are more attracted to social media like face book, twitter and so on. They are spending much of their time in reading posts, chatting with friends and tweets. Electronic gadgets are drawing the youth interest. Young people are likely to text in WhatsApp, browse internet in mobile phones. Also they are not interested to know what is happening in the society because they are busy with their studies and parties. The parents are also not encouraging their childrens towards reading the newspaper. In the survey some were expressed that newspapers are covering more news about the politics so they are not keen to follow the political news. \n I think some of the solutions are parents, schools and colleges should motivate their childrens or students to read the newspaper. It would be better if the schools or colleges allocate daily 15 minutes time to read newspaper before commence the classes also make newspapers are available in the libraries. The young people spend most of their time in college cafeterias and restaurants so it would be good if we arrange some televisions which telecast news. Also government should take some necessary steps and arrange facility to telecast news in public places airports, railway stations and bus stations. Most of the youth use mobile phones so we have to encourage them to read e-newspapers in mobile and tablets.","@vinu460 even though you wrote 297 words for this essay, you will not pass the test. The reason you will not pass is simple, you are not discussing the essay as per the original prompt requirements.

The source you chose to represent in your paraphrase totally changed the way that the essay was to be discussed and what the topic for discussion was. The correct paraphrase is: \n <em>Various countries have shown a trend that indicates a lack of interest in printed news and television news programs among the youth.

It also indicates that you are incapable of presenting a coherent and cohesive English based discussion. Sadly, your badly developed reason paragraph will drag down the good work that you did in the possible solutions discussion paragraph. You would still have received a failing C&C score because of the discussion development problem your essay has. \n The rules the discussion of any of these essays are simple: \n 1 reason = 1 paragraph discussion (topic sentence, reason for validity of chosen topic / reason, supporting explanation, examples, transition sentence) \n *Fully developed discussion = 5 paragraphs \n * A full paragraph discussion is never less than 3 sentences but no more than 5 sentences. \n Using the above guideline, you will be able to score highly in the LR, C&C, and GRA sections because you can prove your ability to think and function in an English setting based upon your fully developed, outlines, and explained individual topic paragraphs.","The essay does not entirely align with the expected response to the original topic. It begins by mentioning a survey on the disinterest among youth in reading newspapers or watching the news, which deviates from the necessary focus on discussing the reasons behind and solutions to this trend. To improve, the essay should begin with a clear statement reflecting on the reasons for the declining interest in traditional news sources among young people and propose feasible solutions. A suggested introduction could be: ""Various countries have shown a trend that indicates a lack of interest in printed news and television news programs among the youth. I believe there are several reasons for this situation. In this essay, I will discuss these reasons and suggest how this lack of interest in obtaining news among young adults can be resolved.""

Formatting-wise, the essay falls short of the expected five-paragraph format, including only three paragraphs. Each reason for the youth's disinterest in news should be elaborated in separate paragraphs. A proper paragraph should include a topic sentence, the reason, supporting explanations, examples, and a transition sentence, adhering to a three to five-sentence structure. 

Moreover, the essay lists reasons and solutions rather than providing a detailed discussion for each. To rectify this, expand on each reason with more depth and provide specific examples or data to support the points made. This approach will also enhance the coherency and cohesion of the essay.

Justify your answer.,"In today's world, there is a boom in entertainment, and one of the most popular forms of which is online games. While it is sometimes considered a social malady that needs proscribing forthwith, I believe that it should be encouraged with moderation instead for some reasons. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that virtual games have some tangible negative effects on players in case of excessive approach. First and foremost, most internet-based games now are designed with many stimulating factors and hence it is easily addictive. Game addiction is partly similar to other types of addiction such as drugs or alcohol one, it leads to severe mental problems, namely stress, anxiety disorder, or even depression. Secondly, gamers' physical health is equally detrimentally impacted. A sedentary lifestyle spending a great deal of time in front of the screen without little or no exercise results in a recession of the body's defense system and thereby they are likely to suffer more common diseases like insomnia and obesity than normal people. Furthermore, an aspect that is believed to be affected is the players' personal life. When they are overmuch wrapped up in the cyber world, they will have less time to focus on their work, study, and relationships with other people. As a consequence, their labor effectiveness is reduced, they are no longer respected by others, and miss out on many values of life. \n However, online games have been credited with certain advantages. To begin with, it serves the same purpose of bringing relaxation as other entertainment forms. Abstemious usage might alleviate the stress that can accumulate throughout a hard day at work. Additionally, gaming ameliorates a player's brain in the long run. In particular, to gain mastery of games, the user needs to harmoniously combine the dexterity of his hands with a nimble brain during the training period and real matches; thus, may improve his decision-making ability step by step. Finally, some indicate that playing games on the internet inadvertently promotes their process of studying languages. To explain this, the users might connect with other ones from all over the world via chatting or speaking directly during the match; therefore, they can acquire knowledge of vocabulary, slang, and grammar. \n In summary, I strongly oppose the prohibition on online games despite its drawbacks besides positive influences. Whether it is beneficial or not lies in how much time one spends on them.","Good work on the prompt restatement. However, you are not using everyday English words that the examiner would appreciate seeing in your essay. While I understand why you would want to show off your advanced English vocabulary, the examiner is actually more interested in how you would explain yourself to a lay person, an ordinary person who speaks normal English, without going high brow since the discussion does not need that sort of word usage. This is just an everyday discussion presentation. \n You cannot give an opinion and then switch your discussion to a comparative discussion. The instruction for this essay is for you to present a single opinion, with 2 justifications in the reasoning paragraphs. When you contradict yourself, the examiner will deduct points for lack of opinion clarity and also, he will not score the unrelated discussion paragraph. So you will lose word count consideration and also receive deductions for not writing 250 words minimum.","The essay addresses the topic effectively by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of online games before concluding with a personal stance. This structure ensures the essay is directly in response to the topic. However, to improve, consider the following points:

1. **Use of Language**: The essay showcases an extensive vocabulary which highlights proficiency in English. However, it's important to remember that clarity and simplicity often enhance understanding, especially in an English proficiency test setting. Aim to use more everyday English words that make the essay accessible to a broader audience. For instance, words like ""abstemious,"" ""ameliorates,"" and ""proscribing"" could be simplified to ""moderate,"" ""improves,"" and ""banning"" respectively. This approach would make the essay more relatable to the average reader without sacrificing the richness of the language.

2. **Clarity of Opinion**: The prompt requires a clear stance on the issue, supported by two main reasons. While the essay begins with stating a personal belief, it somewhat switches to a comparative discussion of both the positive and negative sides, which could confuse readers about the author's initial stand. It’s crucial to maintain a clear and consistent opinion throughout the essay. To strengthen your essay, focus more on explaining why you support the use of online games, detailing the benefits more comprehensively, while briefly acknowledging the negatives as counterarguments rather than equally weighted discussions.

3. **Grammar, Spelling and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written with few noticeable mistakes in grammar and spelling, showcasing an understanding of complex sentence structures. Nonetheless, it is beneficial to review the use of complex words and phrases to ensure they fit the context appropriately and don’t obstruct the clarity of the message. 

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: The essay successfully provides arguments for both sides of the discussion but remember to tie every argument back to the main thesis to strengthen the impact of your stance. Including specific examples or studies could further enrich your arguments, making them more convincing and grounded in reality.

In summary, while the essay is thoughtful and demonstrates an advanced level of English, focusing on simplifying the language for clearer communication, and maintaining a coherent stance throughout will make the argument more compelling and accessible to all readers. This approach will not only keep the essay aligned with the task requirements but also ensure the message is received as intended by a wider audience.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

For my part, I don't agree on the second idea. I absolutely agree with the first idea. There are a few reasons why people prefer this. However, two most significant reasons are genetically mother has better quality and women usually spend more time in taking care of their children. \n One significant reason why people prefer women in taking care of their children is that genetically mother has better quality in taking care of their children. İn other words, the mother has many skills in the care of their children. For instance, mother more tolerant than the father in the care of their children because women have an emotion of motherliness. In addition, mothers can transfer their experience to their daughters to become perfect mothers in the future. As a result, if they want to children in taking care, they should choose women \n Apart from mother have better quality in taking care of their children, women usually spend more time with their children than men because, in many countries, they are usually less engaged in working. Therefore, they can recognize their children better. In addition, mothers can solve their children's problems because the mother must spend more time with their children and gets to know them better. As a result, it is the right choice for women to raise children. \n In conclusion, women can better than men in taking care of children. In other words, if people want to better children in taking of care, they should choose women.

This is a straightforward personal opinion essay. So the way you wrote the essay doesn't really address the prompt instructions for the discussion. A paraphrasing adjustment is in order in this case that should reflect the major instruction of the paper. The adjustment to your essay should sound like this: \n <em>Some people believe that women are better at raising children than men. Others believe that men can be just as effective in raising children. In this essay, I will be discussing my point of view regarding this issue.<br/><br/>In my opinion, women are better at raising and taking care of children because...</em> \n The only problem that I see with your paper is in the opening statement / paraphrasing. The reasons that you discuss within your body paragraphs are sound and valid. These are reasons that most people consider and are popularly accepted as common knowledge. If you could have used a personal experience to further validate your point of view, the discussion would have been scored even higher. In fact, the addition of a negative opinion, using an example, of how a father is not as well equipped in raising children would have further shown an in-depth consideration of the discussion and increased your score even further. \n Regardless of the slight mistakes in punctuation and grammar, you have a well developed discussion and could easily score high marks because of your language proficiency, regardless of the minimal GRA problems. The only scoring down would have been in the opening statement and conclusion portion of the discussion. Your conclusion continued the discussion instead of summarizing the information and delivering a closing statement based on the aforementioned information in your essay. A simple opening line that indicates the conclusion could have been <em>""In conclusion"", ""Finally"", ""To close my opinion statement I would like to reiterate that..""</em> among others.","The essay attempts to discuss the topic of whether women make better parents than men. While the essay clearly presents a stance that women are indeed better equipped for parenting, it is essential to adjust the introduction to better align with the essay prompt's requirements. The introduction should briefly mention the differing viewpoints before stating the personal opinion on the matter. For instance, starting with: ""Some people believe that women are better at raising children than men, while others argue men can be just as effective. In this essay, I will discuss why I believe women are better suited for this role."" This adjustment would make the essay more responsive to the typical format of a comparison and point of view essay.

In terms of content, the arguments provided to support the opinion are well thought out, focusing on the emotional and time investment aspects of parenting from women. However, it could be strengthened by including examples from personal experiences or observations. This would offer concrete evidence to support the claims and make the argument more persuasive. Additionally, considering a counterargument, such as addressing how fathers might also possess unique qualities beneficial to parenting, would provide a more balanced view and deepen the discussion.

The essay has some issues with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure that need attention. For example, there are instances of missing articles (""the mother has better quality"") and incorrect capitalization (""İn other words""). Simplifying complex sentences could also enhance clarity. It's crucial to proofread the essay for these errors, as they can distract from the message being conveyed.

The conclusion needs to succinctly summarize the main points discussed and reiterate the thesis statement to effectively close the argument. Rather than introducing new ideas or continuing the discussion, the conclusion should confirm why the evidence presented supports the opinion that women are better at parenting. A concluding statement like ""In summary, due to their emotional connection and the amount of time they can dedicate, women indeed are better suited for the crucial role of parenting,"" would be more appropriate.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a clear standpoint and utilizes relevant arguments. With adjustments to the structure, a focus on balancing the discussion with counterarguments, and refinement of the language and grammatical accuracy, the essay has the potential to compellingly convey the chosen viewpoint while adhering more closely to the expectations of a comparison and point of view essay.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,2,Argumentative

However, improvement is needed in several areas to enhance clarity, coherence, and responsiveness to the prompt.

Firstly, the prompt asks for a personal opinion, but the essay presents arguments as general statements without personal experience or a clear personal stance. To improve, integrate personal viewpoints or experiences that illustrate your position on video games. This will make your argument more compelling and directly answer the prompt.

Secondly, while the structure of the essay—with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion—is appropriate, there's an issue with paragraph length and sentence clarity. Specifically, one paragraph exceeds the recommended maximum of five sentences, which may affect readability. Aim for three to five sentences per paragraph to maintain clarity and conciseness. Additionally, simplifying complex sentences can make the arguments easier to follow.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay has several areas that require attention:
- Watch out for spelling mistakes (""yongter"" should be ""younger"") and use the correct words in the context (""release"" is likely meant to be ""relax"").
- Pay attention to grammar, such as subject-verb agreement (""games provided harmful knowledge"" should be ""games provide harmful knowledge"").
- Improve sentence structure for clarity (""the gesture would be negatively affected"" is unclear and could be simplified to ""posture can be negatively affected"").

The point of view is somewhat clear, as the essay states a negative stance on video games. However, enhancing the essay with specific personal experiences or a more explicit personal opinion would strengthen this aspect.

The essay attempts to support its position with arguments about the physical and behavioral impacts of video games. Yet, these arguments are not fully developed or supported with clear examples or reasoning. To fortify the essay, expand on each point with specific details or examples. For instance, instead of broadly stating that video games can lead to eye diseases, describe how prolonged exposure without breaks has personally affected you or someone you know.

In conclusion, while the essay demonstrates potential, focusing on a personal standpoint, refining the structure, simplifying the language, correcting grammatical errors, and fully developing arguments with examples will significantly improve its effectiveness and coherence.

This is because the longevity of inhabitants grows sharply and their requirement for retirement also rises so the government must spend money investing in a large number of aspects such as the construction of the nursing homes or state-of-the-art facilities for the healthcare system.

However, there are a few areas where improvements could greatly benefit the overall effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Clarity of Argumentation**: While the personal opinion is clear, the essay would benefit significantly from a more structured presentation of the supporting arguments. The inclusion of two distinct reasons supporting the opinion right at the beginning would provide a clearer roadmap for the reader and set a strong foundation for the argumentation to follow.

2. **Essay Format**: The essay appears to venture into a comparative discussion, which is not required by the prompt. Since the task is to justify the writer's opinion rather than compare different viewpoints, keeping the focus strictly on supporting the stated opinion without diverging into comparative analysis would strengthen the essay's alignment with the prompt requirements.

3. **Content Relevance**: Portions of the essay diverge from directly supporting the main opinion, which could impact the essay's coherence and the strength of argumentation. Focusing solely on arguments that support the opinion would make the essay more concise and potent. The deviation from the prompt's instruction concerning the format and relevance of the discussion can detract from the essay’s overall effectiveness and might affect its score.

4. **Language and Grammar**: Although the language used shows an admirable attempt at complexity, there are instances where simpler language would aid in clarity and coherence. Attention should be paid to spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that can distract from the argument's effectiveness. For instance, ensuring that sentences are not too long and complex would improve readability and understanding.

5. **Use of Examples**: Incorporating specific examples, like those from Germany and Japan, is a good strategy to support the argument. However, ensure that these examples directly back up the main opinion to maintain coherence and relevancy throughout the essay.

Although the increase in elderly people causes a negative long-term impact on both individuals and society, some steps can be taken to tackle these problems. \n Ageing populations around the world have led to disastrous consequences. Rising life expectancy might not be beneficial for old people, as longevity is usually accompanied by deteriorating health and illnesses. Old age is not desirable for not only the elderly but also working adults who have to work more to provide food and medical treatments for the elderly dependents. Moreover, ageing populations result in a fall in productivity in industry and economic downturn, because of the lack of young workforce which is full of economically active people. It will also pose some problems to the government such as the inability to provide enough health care and welfare to meet the needs of pensioners. \n There are various suggested methods to deal with these issues. The first method would be raising the retirement age, so that healthy elderly people can enter the workforce. Secondly, raising income tax to pay for pensions and health care might be an effective solution, despite some oppositions form working-age adults.

However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make it more effective and aligned with the expectations for an English proficiency test essay.

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The essay begins by attributing the increase in life expectancy to the ""rapid advancement of technology,"" which is a broad term and somewhat inaccurate in this context. It's important to specify that advancements in medical science, rather than technology in general, have played a crucial role in extending life spans by helping people overcome illnesses. This distinction will help clarify the argument and ensure it is directly addressing the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written, but there are a few minor errors that could be corrected for clarity and effectiveness. For instance, the phrase ""despite some oppositions form working-age adults"" should be revised for accuracy to ""despite some opposition from working-age adults."" Paying attention to these details can significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of the essay.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The essay outlines a clear stance that the growing number of elderly people presents challenges that need to be addressed. However, the reasoning behind this viewpoint could be further developed. Each point mentioned would benefit from additional explanation and support to make the essay more convincing and to fully communicate the author's perspective.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: The essay mentions several potential solutions to the problems posed by an aging population but lacks detailed explanations and evidence to support these suggestions. Incorporating specific examples, data, and a detailed discussion of how each solution can be effective will strengthen the argument. Instead of listing solutions, the essay should explore each suggestion in-depth, providing a clearer understanding of how these approaches might mitigate the issues associated with an aging population.

Furthermore, structuring the essay into four clear paragraphs - paraphrase, reason, solution, and conclusion - would provide a more organized and focused argument. This structure helps ensure that each segment of the essay contributes to a well-developed discussion on the topic. Each paragraph should start with a strong topic sentence followed by explanations or examples to support the argument, rather than presenting multiple topics without thorough exploration.

In conclusion, by refining the focus on medical advancements, correcting minor errors, elaborating on the presented solutions with examples and evidence, and organizing the essay into a coherent four-paragraph structure, the essay can be significantly improved. This approach not only strengthens the argument but also demonstrates proficiency in English by effectively discussing a topic with clarity and depth.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

First, since the opportunity for higher education is distributed evenly irrespective of students' financial background, everybody would have an equal chance to enhance their life skills and background knowledge.

It is weak because it does not take a true side in the discussion and it doesn't make sense because you refused to present your personal opinion in the essay. \n Your summary conclusion creates a prompt deviation because you are discussing the necessity of a free education instead of the right of a student to a free education.

However, to enhance the essay and adhere more closely to the expected standards for English proficiency tests, several improvements are necessary.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay introduces arguments for and against a tuition-free education system but doesn't clearly indicate a personal stance. For a more effective essay, it's crucial to pick a side on the issue and support that choice with specific reasons and examples. Consider restating the topic in your introduction to make your position clear right from the beginning. This clarity will guide the reader through your arguments and make your conclusion more impactful.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally well-written but could benefit from closer attention to detail in several areas:
   - There's a misuse of ""facts"" where it should be ""fact,"" indicating a singular.
   - The phrase ""as one can perceive"" could be simplified to ""clearly"" or removed for more direct argumentation.
   - Look out for punctuation, such as the misplaced period in ""In conclusion."" It should be ""In conclusion,"" to maintain flow and coherence.
   - The transition between ideas and paragraphs could be smoother by using linking words or phrases to better connect the arguments.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** The essay discusses multiple perspectives but fails to assert a personal viewpoint clearly. Emphasizing a personal stance and explaining why this position is held, supported by compelling arguments and evidence, would make the essay more persuasive and coherent.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay provides several arguments in favor of a tuition-free education system but falls short of deeply analyzing these points or linking them explicitly to the overall assertion. It would benefit from more detailed examples and a more thorough examination of how free education could affect individuals and societies. Additionally, directly addressing potential counterarguments with evidence would strengthen the essay's persuasiveness.

Equipped with knowledge, children will have a positive attitude and behavior toward life. \n On the other hand, each people's learning process depends on various key factors. The fact that whether people begin to enter education early or late is reliant on not only their families' financial condition but their physical and mental health background as well. Typically, parents tend to let their children go to school a certain period later than others do in the light of their health condition from birth. In addition, the low rate of educational participants is prone to be seen in poor rural areas or underdeveloped countries. Besides that reason, the time to leave school is also influenced by individuals' choices. Some people choose to learn vital skills from hands-on experience in place of academic subjects. That is their orientation to their future career path which deserves to be respected. \n To conclude, compulsory education and the freedom to attend academic training have their undeniable advantages. In my point of view, these two methods of education should be integrated by the government to function most effectively.","The writer must be concerned with the number of words that he uses to complete his discussion. He must remember that this is a mere opinion statement and not a comprehensive discussion. It should be completed within 250 to 300 words. Owing to the 40 minute time limit and the need to edit, proofread, and finalize the content of the essay, he should not be writing more than the aforementioned number of words. \n The overwriting can be prevented starting in the first paragraph by not altering the simple thought presentation of the original. His version includes superfluous discussion points that are not a part of the reference material. He is actually changing the discussion basis by adding personal thoughts and sentiments in the restatement portion. Not that he is not allowed to do this because he actually is allowed to that, just in the personal opinion presentation + reasoning topics. By merely changing the position of the sentiments, the writer goes from score reducing (due to irrelevant information) to score increasing (based on opinion clarity via supporting reasons). \n When discussing the public opinions, the writer needs to work harder on making it clear that he is explaining the public reasons for supporting or not supporting the reasons provided. This is done by differentiating the reference point. The use of third party pronouns will actually be beneficial when doing this. It is important to separate the presentation views because the writing instruction clearly indicates that need. By not doing so, the writer does not follow the correct presentation format. The personal opinion, presented as a stand alone paragraph will benefit the most from the correct first person reference points as well. These will help create a comprehensive short discussion presentation. \n A discussion does not need to be very long. It just need to meet the writing requirements regarding opinion clarity, proper word usage, and grammar rules. When an essay becomes too wordy, the writer sacrifices these scoring considerations, opening himself up to more errors and being unable to correct them in the process. In truth, I could go on reviewing this essay deduction point by deduction point but that would be best addressed by a private consultation with me.","The essay addresses the topic effectively by exploring both the importance of starting academic training at a right age and the individual's right to choose their educational path. This demonstrates a good understanding of the subject. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the clarity, coherence, and impact of the discussion.

1. **Word Limit and Conciseness**: The essay appears to exceed the recommended word limit for a task of this nature, which typically suggests aiming for 250-300 words to leave adequate time for editing and finalizing. To improve, focus on expressing ideas more concisely. Avoid adding unnecessary details that are not directly related to the topic. This will not only help in adhering to the word limit but also in making the essay more focused and impactful.

2. **Structure and Clarity**: The introduction of personal opinions and sentiments in parts of the essay where the task is to present general views can lead to confusion. To enhance clarity, clearly separate the explanation of public opinions from your personal stance. Use third-party pronouns (they, them, their) when discussing general views and reserve first-person pronouns (I, my, mine) for expressing your personal opinion. This will help in maintaining a clear distinction between public beliefs and your viewpoint.

3. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: While the essay presents two contrasting views effectively, ensuring each argument is supported with clear and specific examples can strengthen your position. For instance, when mentioning the benefits of early education, providing concrete studies or statistics could make the argument more compelling. Similarly, when discussing the flexibility of educational timing based on individual circumstances, illustrate with real-world scenarios or outcomes.

4. **Grammar and Syntax**: There are minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay that can detract from its overall flow and readability. For example, ""The age to entering academic training"" should be ""The age for entering academic training"". Paying close attention to verb tenses and subject-verb agreement will also enhance the precision of your writing.

5. **Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph successfully encapsulates the discussion by highlighting the merits of both compulsory education and individual choice. To further improve, it would be beneficial to succinctly restate your main arguments before closing. This reinforces your viewpoint and ensures a coherent summation of the essay.

By focusing on these aspects, the essay can become more effective in conveying its message while adhering to the requirements of high-quality, academic writing.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

There are many zoos in the world where animals are tortured and beaten. So, I agree that zoos should be banned. \n Animals in zoos are very poor. When the animals don't do what humans said, it will be beaten and starved like the elephant in India three months ago. The elephant can't stand human abuse and beating so it ran out of the zoo and was shot to death by the polices. Its blood eyes spoke up the cruelty of humans. The animals have stayed in the zoos for a long time, it will lose adaptability to the natural environment. When it's time, the animal caretakers will feed it so it is not necessary to think too much about food so the hunting ability is reduced and the animals in zoos will be lazier than the animals in the wild. \n The zoos are interesting places for visitors. Schools often organize zoo visits for students to learn about animals and plants. That's really useful knowledge for students. At the weekends or in their free time, families who have children will take them to the zoo to have a picnic or relax and see nature and animals. The zoo is also considered a place for protecting endangered species by bringing them into safe environments, protected from poachers, habitat loss, and starvation to avoid extinction. Currently, some animals are hunted in large numbers and are almost extinct, the zoo is a place to preserve them to avoid hunting. \n In conclusion, I agree that zoos should not exist in the 21st century because there are so many animal abuse problems. The rare animals are hunted, we can release them in a small forest with strict guards to avoid wild animal hunters.","There is no reference to any sort of abuse, torture, or animal beatings in the original presentation. These references are part of a personal opinion that should be part of the last sentence / thesis statement. The topic presentation should have been a proper restatement of the factual topic. The essay will lose points due to topic discussion deviations. \n The student must avoid the use of contractions as there are considered non-academic in presentation. The paper must follow formal English writing rules. \n The writer has also confused the discussion presentation. The first reason shows an explanation of why zoos should be banned. In the second, the need for yoos is given eason. Which is the actual supported reason? The essay fails to deliver a clear opinion in the explanations even though a clear opinion was given in the opinion sentence.","The essay responds to the topic by discussing whether zoos should exist in the 21st century, focusing on concerns about animal abuse and the benefits of zoos for education and conservation. However, there are areas for improvement to make the argument stronger and more coherent.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity**: The introduction quickly presents a stance against zoos due to animal abuse, but it incorporates strong opinions early on without establishing a neutral ground first. It's important to begin with a clear, factual statement of the topic before sharing personal views. This helps set a more academic tone for the essay.

2. **Language and Style**: The use of contractions and conversational phrases should be avoided in formal essays. For example, instead of using ""it's"" or ""don't,"" use ""it is"" or ""do not."" This change can improve the academic quality of the writing.

3. **Clear Point of View**: While the essay starts with a strong position against zoos, it later presents arguments that could be seen as benefits of zoos, such as educational opportunities and conservation efforts. This mix of opinions might confuse readers about the essay's stance. It would be beneficial to maintain a consistent viewpoint throughout the essay. If mentioning counterarguments, clearly differentiate them from the main argument and explain why the main argument still stands.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides examples of animal abuse and presents general benefits of zoos. To strengthen the argument, consider providing:
   - Specific evidence and references for claims of abuse to bolster the argument against zoos.
   - A deeper analysis of why alternatives to traditional zoos (like protected wildlife reserves) could offer better solutions for both animal welfare and conservation, reinforcing the initial stance against zoos.

5. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are minor grammatical errors, such as issues with verb tense and pluralization (""the animals have stayed"" might be better as ""animals that stay""). Additionally, there are instances of informal language (""very poor"") that could be revised for formality and precision (""suffer from poor conditions"").

In summary, the essay engages with the topic but can benefit significantly from a clearer structure, a more consistent and formal tone, and stronger, evidence-backed arguments. Distinguishing between personal opinion and argumentative stance at the beginning and avoiding mixing benefits with drawbacks without clear demarcation can also help in presenting a more compelling and cohesive argument.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

In the ancient Chinese society, it really limited to develop and follow own mind due to traditional custom. Therefore, in my opinion, I firmly agree with this statement that young people become more independent and can do decisions by themselves. \n To begin with, there are many different kinds of opportunities can young people choose. In modern, because of a prosperous life, more and more needed from people has emerged, as a result, others will provide services what they want. For instance, social media is common now, everybody can show themselves and ideas to the public through this way, also, people are attracted by that information. Youtuber which is a new type job is a good example, many people as youtuber can earn money to survive. In contrast, young people didn't have too much option to choose their work in past time, what they could do just being the officer or taking over the family business, so they always relied on their parents to provide money to study or work. But today there are various selections of work, so young people have the ability to choose what they want to do. \n Secondly, it is free to develop relationships between man and women. Women can meet others with no obstacle from her parents, and men also can marry the girl who he loved. Moreover, through social media, such as Facebook, Skype, and dating apps, people can meet different people from foreign countries. The means widen the range of making friends, also have more possibility to develop the relationship. On the other hand, young people in early Chinese society, they all had to listen to parents, who help them to decide who they can marry. Because there were many rules and old concepts which needed to be obeyed at that time. Thus, people now can choose their wife or husband by themselves, it is better for them to have own life, rather than depend on the family and lost values of self. \n Irrefutably, some people may say that today young people who have too much liberty decide what they want, it causes the society become competitive and the strait between elder and next generation. However, if young people can have a chance to determine their life, it means that they can take care of themselves. They can create any possibility as well, to make the society advance in the future. \n In short, due to many limitations in past time, most of the young people have to comply with parents, instead of having a chance to plan their life. Conversely, they are freer in the modern times, many advantages for them to arrange life, no matter to organize their family or work in a suitable position.","Dear student, in an actual exam, the examiner would have taken one look at this essay and decided to give you a failing score.

Look at the comparison below to understand why that happened: \n <em>Original Prompt:<br/>Topic: In the past, young people depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them<br/>Discussion Point: today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.<br/>Discussion Instruction: Do you agree or disagree</em> \n <em>Your Paraphrase:<br/>Topic: In the ancient Chinese society, it really limited to develop and follow own mind due to traditional custom.<br/>Discussion Point: The evolution of the world is quite rapidly, and the structure of society and lifestyle also change gradually, becoming more complex and more options.<br/><br/>Discussion Response: I firmly agree with this statement that young people become more independent and can do decisions by themselves.</em> \n What key element is missing in your discussion? Exactly. The topic is not about Chinese society and its traditions and customs in general. It is about the international concept of parents making decisions for their young offspring rather than allowing the maturing or adult offspring to decide for themselves. Your essay is nowhere near the requirements of the prompt in terms of topic or discussion. That is why it got a score of 1. Your answer was completely unrelated to the task provided.","The essay submitted shows effort in addressing a topic related to independence and decision-making among young people. However, there are significant areas for improvement to ensure that the essay fully meets the requirements of the assigned topic and to enhance its overall quality. The feedback provided below aims to guide these improvements:

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The main issue with the essay is that it doesn't closely align with the specific topic provided. The given topic centers on the shift from young people relying on their parents for decision-making to becoming more autonomous in making decisions about their own lives today. Instead of focusing on the ancient Chinese society or the general evolution of the world, it's important to directly address how young people's decision-making has changed over time, specifically regarding their independence from parental influence.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several spelling, grammar, and style errors that need attention. For example, 
   - The phrase ""The evolution of the world is quite rapidly,"" could be corrected to ""The evolution of the world is quite rapid.""
   - Consider revising ""can do decisions by themselves"" to ""can make decisions by themselves.""
   Remember, clarity and correctness in language use enhance the readability and impact of your argument.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: While your agreement with the statement that young people have become more independent is noted, the articulation of this stance could be clearer and more consistent throughout the essay. Stating your main argument clearly in the introduction and reiterating your perspective in the conclusion can strengthen your position.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay presents examples, such as the role of social media and changes in relationship dynamics, to support the idea of increased independence among young people. However, these arguments could be more directly connected to the essay's main point about decision-making without excessive parental influence. For each example, explicitly state how it illustrates young people making their own choices independently of their parents. This direct connection will help solidify your argument.

5. **Addressing the Counterargument**: The effort to acknowledge a counterargument is good practice, but it could be integrated more smoothly into the essay by directly linking it to the central argument about independence in decision-making. Elaborating on how this increased liberty and ability to choose might impact society and individual relationships between generations can provide a more balanced perspective.

To improve your essay, focus on aligning it more closely with the given prompt, addressing language errors, clarifying your stance, directly connecting your examples to your main argument, and more efficiently integrating counterarguments. With these revisions, your essay will be more coherent, relevant, and persuasive.",3,4,4,2,3,3,2,4,4,1,Argumentative

In Singapore, students suffer from health problems due to stress from our demanding education system. This is why the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education are working closely to ensure that students are kept from developing mental and physical problems that will affect their health and education. I believe that secondary schools can ensure health, well-being and the safety of students by promoting health campaigns, making sure that students eat healthily, and making sure that they have a balanced lifestyle. \n Firstly, by promoting health campaigns, students will be educated on how to prevent themselves from falling ill. Through these health campaigns, students will learn the signs that will tell them if they are falling ill or if they are overworking themselves. Amongst Singaporean youths, is it very common to have headaches and migraines due to the stress of trying to keep up with their demanding syllabus from their schools. However, just because it is common, does not mean it is ok. Headaches and migraines are the first base to falling ill. That is why we have to prevent it to ensure that students are kept from falling ill. Thus, promoting health campaigns will ensure that students are equipped with the skills and knowledge to prevent them from falling ill. \n Secondly, by ensuring that students are eating healthily, they will be encouraged to start a healthy diet. Maintaining a healthy diet is the first step to ensuring that a student's well-being is well taken care of. Schools can do this by ensuring that at least one day a week, students are given fruit everytime they buy a meal during recess. By doing this, student's will be getting a healthy fruit in their diet. This will benefit their health greatly. Thus, by ensuring that students maintain a healthy diet, students will be prevented from developing health issues. \n Thirdly, by making sure that students lead a balanced lifestyle, they will be able to lead a happier and healthier life. Due to long school hours, and the countless amount of homework given by teachers, students are not able to balance out their lifestyle. Because of this, the obesity rate of Singaporean youth is on the rise. Thus, schools can step in to ensure that students have more exercise per week. By conducting mass exercises every morning and after-school activities related to exercise, students will be able to lead a more healthier lifestyle. \n In conclusion, by promoting health campaigns, making sure that students eat healthily, and making sure that they have a balanced lifestyle, we are able to create a conducive environment for students to achieve their best learning capabilities.","Dear student, Amadeus. It's nice to have you back here. I enjoy reading your written work. You have the potential to be a smooth English language writer if you continue to progress with your writing skills. You could probably achieve native speaker status if you really work at it. In order to achieve that status though, you need to address certain writing problems that you currently have. \n One of these problems would be how you need to learn when to use ""is"" and when to use ""are"". It is a matter of knowing that ""is"" connotes a singular form while ""are"" indicates plural form. So when you say ""Health, well-being, and safety..."" the correct numeral connotation to use here is ""are"" because you are presenting the present indicative plural of a series of connected words. \n Now, you are being asked what the secondary schools can do to promote the health, well-being, and safety of the students. This implies that an actual plan needs to come from you as the writer as to how to solve the issue. You can't just keep mentioning the problems and suggesting that the school or school authorities take action without saying what action you suggest that they take. You can do that because the question asks ""What do you think..."" So a call to action is involved in your response per topic. \n Try to avoid redundancies in your presentation. The third paragraph is saying the same thing over and over again. Just indicate the topic sentence once then move on to the justification and suggested solution. 3 sentences should do it but since you have a 500 word maximum, go ahead and explain away. Just avoid constant repetition in the paragraph. \n Your statement about the balanced lifestyle is the best written paragraph in this essay. It shows a topic sentence, justifications, and suggested solutions to the problem. Perfect.","The essay addresses the topic effectively, focusing on ways secondary schools can promote the health, well-being, and safety of their students. The argument is well structured, with three clear points: promoting health campaigns, ensuring students maintain a healthy diet, and encouraging a balanced lifestyle. These arguments support the position clearly and are descriptive, highlighting both the issue and potential solutions.

However, there are areas that could be improved to strengthen the essay:

1. **Grammar and Usage:** Pay attention to the use of singular and plural forms. For instance, when discussing multiple subjects like ""Health, well-being, and safety,"" the correct verb to use is ""are"" because you are referring to more than one aspect. This small adjustment will improve the readability and accuracy of your writing.

2. **Call to Action:** While the essay suggests actions secondary schools can take, it would be more impactful to directly propose specific initiatives or steps. For example, when mentioning health campaigns, elaborate on what these campaigns could look like or specific topics they might cover. This approach makes your suggestions more concrete and actionable.

3. **Avoiding Redundancies:** It's important to be concise and avoid repeating the same idea in different words within the same paragraph. Each sentence should add new information or perspective to your argument. If you find yourself restating the same point, consider moving on to additional details or another aspect of your argument to keep the reader engaged and provide a more thorough exploration of the topic.

4. **Highlighting Solutions:** While all the paragraphs outline problems and solutions, making sure each solution is as clear and developed as the one about leading a balanced lifestyle can strengthen your essay. For each problem identified, offer a well-thought-out solution or action that schools can take.

Improving these areas will not only make your essay more compelling but also showcase your ability to think critically and suggest practical solutions. Remember, the goal is to express your ideas clearly and persuasively while adhering to grammatical norms and avoiding repetition.

These questions make them try to find out the root of their family. \n Despite difficulties, there are several reasons why they do that. Firstly, a lot of people try to find their long-lost family member for a reunion. For instance, many people try to look for the location where their relatives, who joined in wars, were buried and bring back to the homeland to be with their ancestors. Secondly, some with a special first name like ""Dao"", they may want to know if their root related to the royalty or some celebrities. Thirdly, others want to find out the information of their relatives about some genetic diseases in the past. \n With these reasons above, this can be considered as a positive development. People are anle to uphold the family traditions, prevent some diseases and so on. However, there is still a drawback. Some are obsessed with the past and forget the present and his or her future. Also, it costs a huge amount of money. \n In conclusion, finding the history of the family is a good trend for the young to remember their ancestors.

I am expecting that after my explanations, you will show an improvement in your next practice essay presentation. \n An opening statement needs to accurately rephrase the original prompt. You did not do that in this essay. The opinion that the tracing of the family history is a positive trend should have been the last part of the opening statement. It would have come after the restatement of the topic, discussion instructions, and opinion overview presentation. Since your essay does not follow this format, you can bet that you will not get a good score on this essay. \n The body paragraph discussions are not accurately done either. That is because you mixed the discussion points required in the opening statement with the informative discussion paragraphs portion of the essay. You will be losing score considerations quite rapidly at this rate and will most likely get less than passing scores in the process. \n I strongly suggest that you review other essays relating to the same topic so that you can familiarize yourself with the proper formatting and expected discussion when it comes to similar themes in the future.

This enthusiasm for uncovering one's ancestral past is a captivating topic. However, to enhance the essay's effectiveness, there are several areas that require attention and improvement.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay begins by noting an increased interest in family history, which aligns with the general theme. Nonetheless, the introductory segment could more effectively set the stage for the discussion by directly addressing the essay question and stating a clear opinion on the topic. Making a direct connection between the prompt and your stance at the beginning would improve clarity and focus.

2. **Structural and Stylistic Issues:** The essay lacks a conventional structure that guides the reader through the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion in a cohesive manner. Each part of the essay should have a distinct purpose: introducing the topic and your viewpoint, elaborating on your reasons with supporting examples, and concluding with a summary of your argument. Sticking to a more structured format will enhance the reader's understanding and engagement.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** While your essay hints at a positive view on tracing family history, this stance should be distinctly expressed and consistently supported throughout the essay. A clearer assertion of your viewpoint in the introduction and a more focused discussion in the body paragraphs would strengthen the essay.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay provides several reasons why individuals might explore their ancestry, such as seeking connections with long-lost relatives or understanding genetic diseases. However, these points could be further developed with more detailed examples and explanations to better support your opinion. Additionally, integrating a discussion on potential drawbacks, as you briefly mentioned, could offer a more balanced view.

To elevate the quality of your writing:
- Begin with a more explicit statement of your position on the topic.
- Organize your essay with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion structure.
- Make your viewpoint unmistakable and back it up with well-explained reasons and examples.
- Review examples of high-scoring essays to familiarize yourself with effective structures and arguments related to similar themes.

Others think education will not work. \n Discuss both views and give your opinion. \n It is a fact that people are doing great harm to their bodies by consuming processed food with a high frequency. To many people, the best method to preclude this growing pressing matter is education while others disagree and claim that educating people of the dire effects of unhealthy food will be of no avail. I personally agree with those who believe that education is the key to this problem. \n There are several ways in which educating might be ineffective in the fight against the consumption of processed food. The first reason is simply because it saves a lot of time in the current fast-paced lifestyle. In the hustle and bustle of the city rat race, people often crave time, always prioritise productivity and that's why handy food like that gain such popularity. In this case, the situation basically leaves them with little choice. The second rationale to ignore the role of education is that the price of this food is most of the time affordable. The fact why junk food is favour by most people, especially children and teenagers comes from its modest price for a nice treat. It can satisfy people of all socioeconomic statuses, from the people of low-income families to the affluent entrepreneurs who are always on business and lack time. \n However, I'm still on the side that without education, the problem will never be eradicated comprehensively in the future. All problems in society seem to stem from people's mindset and behaviour that is inherited in the environment they live in. For example, if a child lives in a house where his parents consume fast food on a daily basis, he may have the tendency to do so. The only way to break this convention is certainly a change in awareness that can only be brought about by education. With the equipment of knowledge, people may steer clear of this kind of food in aware of how detrimental it is or at least try to reduce how much they consume ready-made food. The educational programs and campaigns designed to raise people's awareness are in effect prove fruitful. For example, people gradually shift to a more healthy diet of vegetable-based meals made from home thanks to the growing amount of tutor videos about eating clean. Had it not been for education, people would never experience such a change now. \n In conclusion, while I agree that there are a couple of reasons why people can ignore what they know about the adverse impacts of overconsuming junk food, education still plays a vital role in the elimination of this issue.","Since a specific question was indicated and the need for advice regarding it is evident, I will not be offering an essay review in this instance. I will instead, respond to the question of the writer. Yes, the essay is too long and can be shorter. That is why I recommend that the student not write more than 300 words for the total essay. 300 words is equivalent to 5 sentences per paragraph or 20 lines overall in the presentation. \n The best way to avoid overwriting is to avoid using place holders, word, sentence, or phrase fillers that do nothing to move the idea of the writer forward. Mentions of: \n <quotation>In the hustle and bustle of the city rat race,</quotation> \n <quotation>In this case,</quotation> \n <quotation>For example,</quotation> \n <quotation>In conclusion</quotation> \n are all unnecessary in the presentation as these are mere extenders used to meet the word count. Useful sentence ideas that actually provide concise content should be developed through the review and revision of paragraphs and sentences. Learn to compress the meaning of the sentence, without using a run-on. It is not important to overdiscuss and use a lot of words. Practice saying more with less words. This can be practiced by not using IELTS task 2 discussion essays yet. One can learn to practice the less is more writing style through the writing of task 1 analysis essays, which require no more than 200 words to complete. Perfect the task 1 essay word count and the task 2 essay presentation will be easier to accomplish in short form.","This essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing both views on whether education can solve the problem of high consumption of processed food. The author's point of view is clear, advocating for education as a key solution. There are descriptive arguments supporting this position, contrasting the effectiveness of education against the reasons why people might continue consuming processed food despite being aware of its negative impacts.

However, several areas can be improved for enhanced clarity and impact. Firstly, the essay could benefit from being more concise. Aim for brevity by condensing your thoughts and avoiding unnecessary filler phrases such as ""in the hustle and bustle of the city rat race,"" or transitional phrases like ""For example,"" when they don't add new information. This will help keep your essay within a more manageable length, making your arguments more potent and direct.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written but could be streamlined. For instance, instead of saying, ""It is a fact that people are doing great harm to their bodies by consuming processed food with a high frequency,"" consider simplifying it to ""Frequently consuming processed food harms people’s health significantly."" This not only shortens the sentence but also makes the statement more direct.

It's crucial to practice conveying your ideas succinctly. To develop this skill, focus initially on writing shorter essays, such as those required in task 1 analysis essays, which demand clear, concise writing without exceeding 200 words. Learning to express ideas forcefully and directly in a shorter format can be excellent preparation for more extended essays, helping you to articulate your arguments effectively without resorting to verbosity.

Additionally, while providing examples and reasons is beneficial, ensure that each one directly contributes to your argument's advancement. Every sentence should serve a clear purpose in supporting your position. By revising your essay to remove redundancies and focusing on directness, you can strengthen your argumentation and make your essay more compelling and easier to follow.

From my perspective, this phenomenon is driven by myriad reasons and some adverse impacts could have on individuals. \n There are two underlying reasons why people behave in that manner. First and foremost, people desire to stay at pace with the trend. To avoid falling behind, the public would seek more new gorgeous items that are appropriate for the times. For instance, young people readily afford around 2000 dollars for a trendy smartphone from Apple company to show it off to netizens. Another main culprit behind over-consumerism is advertisements. They appear throughout all places with a variety of eye-catching and stylish products that make people want to own them. \n It is obvious that numerous detrimental influences could happen to the aforementioned problems. Firstly, a number of people can be getting into debt. Despite the fact that their funds are restricted, they continue to shop. Hence, they have to borrow money from the bank to cover those expenses. Secondly, natural sources will be overexploited. Basically, the more regular items people use, the more products are manufactured. \n In conclusion, there are several factors leading to the background of the throwaway society.

However, there are areas where improvement is needed to strengthen your argument and adhere more closely to the requirements of an English proficiency test.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity**:
- Your essay does respond to the topic, but it could do so more directly. It's important to clearly state your main argument at the beginning. Avoid combining multiple ideas in one sentence. For example, separate your thesis about the reasons for consumerism from its impacts for clearer presentation.

2. **Language Use**:
- Try to avoid memorized phrases like ""In this day and age,"" as they can make your writing seem less original and may affect your score. Aim for more natural and varied expressions to convey your thoughts.
- Be mindful of your sentence construction. Make sure each sentence expresses a single complete idea. This will make your essay easier to follow and strengthen your arguments.

3. **Argument Development**:
- When you mention that there are specific reasons for a behavior or phenomenon, it is essential to clearly and fully explain each reason. If you mention two reasons, make sure both are thoroughly discussed. This demonstrates comprehensive thinking and supports your argument effectively.
- Develop your explanations further to make them more convincing. For instance, when discussing the influence of advertisements or the trend of purchasing new items, provide more detailed examples or data to back up your points.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:
- There are minor grammatical and style issues throughout your essay. For instance, be cautious with article use (e.g., ""an Apple company"" should be ""the Apple company"") and ensure your sentences are complete and not run-on.
- Aim for simplicity and clarity in your writing. It's better to write in a straightforward manner that accurately conveys your argument than to use complex language that could confuse the reader or lead to errors.

5. **Point of View and Support**:
- Your point of view is present but could be articulated more strongly. Begin with a definitive statement of your perspective on the issue. Throughout, use clear and descriptive arguments that support your position. Each paragraph should contain evidence or examples that reinforce your viewpoint.

6. **Conclusion**:
- Your conclusion summarizes the main points but consider reinforcing your standpoint here as well. A strong concluding statement can leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Overall, your essay has a good foundation with a relevant topic. Focus on developing your arguments more thoroughly, using clear and precise language, and ensuring your ideas are well-organized.

You must be able to read, understand, brainstorm, draft, review, revise, edit, and finalize the content of the essay, in English, within 40 minutes. On the contrary, the longest essay that you can write, being an ESL speaker will be between 275-300 words. That is a guaranteed word range based on the requirements of the essay. The next time you write a practice essay, use a timer, that will be the best way to assume how many words you might be able to write given a particular topic during the actual test. Remember, you have editing consideration to allot time for as well so don't use up all 40 minutes just drafting the essay. \n Now, it is fairly obvious to the reader that you have done extensive research, most likely internet based research for this essay. That is why it is highly technical in discussion and offers highly researched discussion points. Kindly remember that you are taking a pen and paper test at the center. That means you will not have access to internet sources during the test. Therefore, you will only be able to use what little or extensive knowledge you have, based on personal knowledge and experience to write the essay. That is another reason why you will be unable to write 500 words during the actual test. \n The advice given to you regarding the 3-5 sentence minimum and maximum requirement is correct though so you should keep that in mind when writing your paragraphs. Now, it will be better for me to not consider this essay as your first practice test. The first essay is always the one that I base my advice for correction upon. While your essay is clearly presented in terms of reasoning, it requires a shortening of discussion. Therefore, for your next practice test, try to make yourself understood in English within the required sentence allotment. I will begin a more in-depth analysis of your next essay because I hope to see you present a more properly formatted essay at that point. \n By the way, since this is a direct question essay, please begin the statement by rephrasing the prompt for discussion and then offering 2 more sentences that directly respond to the questions provided. These 2 responses will be the topic sentences for your reasoning paragraphs. The opening paragraph basically serves to help you outline the discussion presentation every time so take the time to properly understand the discussion instructions then address it properly in the first paragraph. It will make it easier for you to write the reasoning paragraphs because you have already outlined and mapped your discussion topics beforehand.","The essay addresses the urgent issue of biodiversity loss due to human activities, which shows an understanding of the topic. However, there are several areas where improvements can greatly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The essay touches upon the causes and possible solutions for biodiversity loss. To improve, it is crucial to directly answer the prompt in the introduction by rephrasing the question followed by two sentences that outline the main arguments. This method will help in clearly setting the stage for the discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   There are numerous spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. For instance, ""animal losing their extinctions"" should be corrected to ""animals facing extinction."" Be careful with verb tenses, singular/plural nouns, and sentence structure to ensure readability. Avoid long, complex sentences that might confuse the reader. Short, clear sentences can more effectively deliver your message.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:**
   The essay could benefit from a clearer expression of the author's stance. Introducing the essay with a strong thesis statement that reflects your main argument and then using topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph can help in making your viewpoint unmistakable to the reader.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:**
   While the essay attempts to provide arguments and examples, they often lack detail and clarity. Each paragraph should start with a clear argument (topic sentence), followed by evidence or examples, and then a brief explanation of how this supports your main point. For instance, rather than simply stating that waste in the oceans harms sea life, explain how plastics release toxins that disrupt the marine food chain, leading to species extinction.

5. **Word Count and Time Management:**
   Writing within a limited time frame requires effective time management. Aim for a word count that allows for planning, drafting, and revising within the allotted time. For an English proficiency test, a range of 275-300 words is more realistic than attempting 500 words. Use a timer during practice sessions to get a better sense of timing.

6. **Technical Language and Personal Knowledge:**
   Although the essay showcases research, remember that during the test, you won't have access to the internet. It's important to write based on what you know and can recall. This means preparing by reading widely and familiarizing yourself with common topics before the test. Try to simplify your language to ensure your points are made clear and understandable.

Lastly, as you prepare for the next practice essay, focus on organizing your thoughts clearly, making sure your grammar and spelling are correct, and directly addressing the essay prompt. Practice writing concise sentences and paragraphs that are structured around clear main ideas, supported by examples or evidence, and conclude each paragraph by relating it back to your overall argument.",3,4,4,4,3,3,2,3,3,1,Argumentative

It also becomes the only way of learning and teaching during pandemics and disasters. However, by the fact that it can be too impersonal for some and discourages others for their lack of technological skills or passion, it is still not the best method to teach and learn.","<quotation>This essay will discuss both sides of this approach.</quotation> \n It is not necessary to indicate how the essay will be written.

You just have to give an idea of how you will be discussing the topic. That way you will meet the TA writer's opinion section requirement. \n Remember to edit your work before submission to avoid unnecessary deductions.

This is a great start, as you have identified a relevant and timely issue. However, to further improve the clarity and impact of the essay, consider the following points:

1. **Relevance to the Topic:** You have adequately responded to the topic by outlining the impact of technology in education and discussing both its positives and negatives. To enhance your essay, provide a more explicit statement of your viewpoint or how you intend to explore the topic right at the beginning. Instead of stating, ""This essay will discuss both sides of this approach,"" dive directly into presenting the key advantage or disadvantage you will explore. This approach will make your introduction more engaging and focused.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** There are minor errors in the essay that disrupt the flow and can affect readability. Specifically, the first word of a paragraph was not capitalized (""not everything, however about the introduction of this new technology into education is useful""), which can detract from the overall presentation of your work. Pay attention to capitalization, punctuation, and the correct usage of words to enhance the professionalism of your essay. Additionally, some sentences could be simplified for coherence and ease of understanding, especially considering the audience might include English language learners.

3. **Author’s Point of View:** The essay outlines both advantages and disadvantages of technology in education, but it lacks a clear authorial stance. While it is important to discuss both sides of the issue, clarifying your own perspective or suggesting a balanced approach could make your argument more compelling. Remember, even when not explicitly asked for an opinion, indicating a leaning towards one argument over another, or a balanced view, can make your essay more persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You provided examples of how technology can enhance learning, like interactive quizzes and video tutorials, which is excellent. To strengthen your argument further, include more specific examples or data to support your claims. For instance, mentioning studies or statistics about improved learning outcomes due to technology use could substantiate your points. On the contrary side, when discussing the disadvantages, beyond mentioning the reduced face-to-face interaction, include how this impacts the learning process or suggest ways to overcome this issue.

In summary, your essay effectively addresses the topic of technology in education, presenting both sides of the story. To improve, work on refining your grammar and style, clarify your stance, and further develop your arguments with specific examples or evidence. By making these adjustments, your essay can become more compelling and polished.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Lots of inappropriate behavior may have a negative effect on their psychology due to phone radiation. This hazard makes children feel alone, catharsis, as well as being isolated from sociality.

While minimal points will be awarded in these sections, the fact that the writer did not follow the writing and discussion instructions are originally indicated have prevented the writer from gaining a passing score.

However, to improve the essay and align it more effectively with English proficiency test expectations, several areas should be addressed.

1. **Adherence to the Topic:**
The essay must respond directly to the question or topic provided. Ensure the essay sticks closely to the original instructions and doesn't stray from the given topic. It's crucial to understand the prompt fully and structure the essay to directly address each part of the prompt. In this instance, re-evaluating the original prompt and aligning the essay's content more closely with it can enhance the essay's relevance and coherence.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
While the essay conveys ideas, it would benefit from a closer review of spelling, grammar, and style. There are instances of awkward phrasing (""so-call"" should be ""so-called"", ""catharsis"" seems misused, and ""sociality"" is likely meant to be ""socialization"") and punctuation errors that can be refined. Additionally, using clearer and more precise language will make the arguments stronger and easier to follow. A thorough proofreading session focusing on sentence structure and grammatical accuracy could greatly improve the quality of the text.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
The conclusion indicates a personal opinion, stating that the trend is seen as positive. However, the essay would benefit from clearer signposting throughout to indicate when an opinion is being presented versus when information or evidence is being discussed. This clarity will help the reader understand and follow the author's line of reasoning more effectively.

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Support:**
The essay presents arguments for both sides of the issue but would benefit from more specific examples and evidence. When discussing the disadvantages, such as the ""Momo challenge"", providing sources or further details could strengthen the argument. Similarly, for the advantages, expanding on how early exposure to technology can aid development with more examples or citing studies could make the case more compelling. Furthermore, ensuring that each argument directly supports the author's viewpoint will add to the essay's coherence.

However, some people generally believed that beside of making a profit, these enterprises are accountable for helping the society. I strongly agree that businesses should have a role in acting for the community. \n First of all, it is admitted that by making money, corporations can survive in this competitive world. Companies have to spend a large amount of money on employees and many kinds of taxes. If businesses could not affordable to pay for them, they might go into bankrupt. As the consequence, this would become a burden to the government due to the increase in the unemployment rate. Indeed, making a profit is necessary as it helps develop the economy of a country. \n On the other hand, as human beings, businessman and businesswoman are responsible for making the community better. Because running a business also has some negative impacts on things such as the environment. One of the good examples is when producing plastic bags, many emissions from factories are released to the environment, which lead to the pollution. Therefore, finding solutions is one of the duty which businesses have to be accountable for. In fact, everyone has an obligation to develop the society. \n To sum up, corporations need to make money in order to remain its business.

Social responsibility is based say, on the way a product affects the mental health of a person. The way a product encourages poor people to buy a product because it is in fashion, even if they have to borrow money to do it. The social responsibility is related to the way a business is directly responsible for the way people lead their lives in relation to the product brand. \n The writer understands some, but not all of the topic. The lack of understanding led to the irrelevant / incorrect reasoning presentation.","The essay clearly states agreement with the idea that businesses should be responsible not only for making profits but also for supporting the community. This perspective is well-presented, showing a strong viewpoint from the start. However, there are several key areas where the essay could be significantly improved to better match the essay prompt and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The first paragraph after introducing the opinion does not directly support the stated opinion about businesses having a social responsibility. It discusses the necessity of making profits for the survival of businesses, which, although related, does not address how or why businesses should contribute to society. To improve, focus on explaining how businesses, while making profits, can also actively work towards benefiting society.

2. **Understanding of Social Responsibility**: The essay slightly misinterprets the concept of social responsibility by focusing heavily on environmental impacts, which, while important, are only one aspect. Social responsibility encompasses broader concerns, including ethical business practices, impacting the community positively, and ensuring products or services do not harm individuals' mental, physical, or financial well-being. For a more relevant response, consider discussing how businesses can influence people's lives beyond environmental factors, such as through ethical marketing, offering fair wages, or contributing to local communities.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that hinder understanding. For instance, ""beside of making a profit"" should be ""besides making a profit,"" and ""businessman and businesswoman"" can be replaced with ""businesspeople"" for conciseness. Moreover, ""could not affordable to pay"" should be ""could not afford to pay."" Aim to simplify sentences and use a grammar checker to identify and correct these mistakes.

4. **Clarity and Descriptiveness**:
   - **Clarity**: At times, the essay’s arguments are not clearly articulated, making it hard for readers to follow the author's main points. Work on structuring sentences and paragraphs in a way that each thought is expressed clearly and logically follows from the previous one.
   - **Descriptiveness**: While the essay mentions the importance of businesses contributing to society, it lacks specific examples or detailed explanations of how this can be achieved. Enhancing the essay with practical examples or suggesting ways businesses can fulfill their social responsibilities would make the arguments more persuasive and engaging.

5. **Point of View**: The essay successfully communicates a personal viewpoint, agreeing that businesses should engage in the welfare of the community. This clear stance is a strength. Build on this by providing more detailed support and reasoning that directly relates to the topic of social responsibility as it pertains more broadly to the impact of businesses on society.

In summary, to strengthen the essay, refine the focus to directly address the social responsibilities of businesses beyond environmental impacts, correct grammatical errors, clarify arguments, and enrich the content with specific, relevant examples.

However, there are also a number of disadvantages for people to do that. \n First of all, working after school can help students get practical experiences ready to go to the academy. For example, if people want to major in marketing in the university, they can take a part-time job in a store or café shop where they can get close with many customers and know exactly what customers want. Moreover, for someone who hasn't known what discipline they will study in university can be easier to find out their true passion.

It presents both advantages and disadvantages of taking a gap year for work before pursuing higher education.

1. **Response to the topic:** The essay addresses the topic by outlining both positives and negatives of taking a job before university. However, presenting a personal opinion (""I think this is a good idea"") is not necessary unless specifically asked for in the prompt. The task is to analyze the advantages and disadvantages without including personal views unless prompted.

2. **Spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues:** The essay contains several grammatical and stylistic errors that could hinder clarity. For example, ""In the other hand"" should be corrected to ""On the other hand,"" and it's ""café shop"" not ""café shop"". Paying attention to the correct use of articles, prepositions, and transition phrases will enhance the readability and professionalism of the essay. Also, ensuring proper sentence structure and punctuation will significantly improve the essay's quality.

3. **Clarity of the author's point of view:** The essay aims to present both sides of the argument but does so by integrating a personal opinion which is not required by the prompt. It's important to focus on objectively analyzing the topic without inserting personal views unless the instructions specifically ask for it.

4. **Arguments and supporting evidence:** The arguments posed about the gains of work experience and potential risks of taking a gap year lack depth and connection. It would be beneficial to focus on no more than two advantages and two disadvantages, providing clear, related examples and substantiation for each. Instead of listing multiple, loosely connected points, delve deeper into fewer, well-explained arguments. This approach will make the essay stronger and more convincing. For instance, discussing how practical experience in a job can directly benefit university coursework would make for a stronger argument if detailed examples and analysis accompany it.

Moreover, avoid making exaggerated or unsupported claims, such as implying that taking a gap year could ""ruin their whole life."" Such statements need more evidence and detract from the essay's objectivity.

In this essay, I will discuss both positions and give my opinion regarding this matter. \n There are several reasons why hosting an international sporting event is good for a country. First of all, the hosting country will attract many visitors around the world to these events so this will bring benefits to the service industry of this country. Because, besides following sporting events, almost all visitors will spend their money to visit and experience famous traveling destinations, tourist services in the hosting country. In addition, hosting an international competition with a lot of tourists will help the hosting country broadcast their national image, especially their service industry to the world. Therefore, this will be a potential chance to develop the country's service industry and bring economical benefits to this country. Secondly, being the organization of sporting events will stimulate the pride of each individual to their country and being a positive promotion to help this country's athletes try their best to give the champion for their country. \n On the other hand, organizing an international sporting event may make some drawbacks to the hosting country. First, hosting these events demand a country to pay a big amount of money to upgrade the infrastructure of their sport venue and other preparatory fees. Especially with some countries where the infrastructure of their sport venues are old, this will be a hard game among benefits and negative impacts. Secondly, the reception of a large number of foreign guests will lead to the risk of fraud, riff of prices to the foreign tourists so this issue can make a negative impression on tourists to the hosting country. Moreover, many tourists visit, environmental problems are also concerned due to the increased amount of waste. \n In conclusion, becoming a hosting of national sporting events would bring both sides of effect to the hosting nation but I believe that the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages.","The restated opinions must be presented as 2 stand-alone sentences. These separate sentences will allow the reader to better understand the individual nature of each pov. The witter must never fully depend on the use of commas in a paragraph for sentence formation.

However, there are areas that could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

1. **Response to Topic**: The introduction succeeds in presenting the debate but could be strengthened by directly stating the personal opinion. Including a clear statement of your stance in the introduction is essential for a strong opening and contributes positively to your score by showing comprehension skills.

2. **Grammar and Style**: The essay exhibits some issues with comma usage and sentence structure. It's crucial to remember that using commas excessively or incorrectly can lead to run-on sentences, which may confuse readers and lower your score. Try to vary your sentence types between simple and complex structures for better clarity and flow. Additionally, avoid starting sentences with ""because"" as it works better as a connector within sentences rather than at the beginning.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While your conclusion provides a personal opinion, this viewpoint should be highlighted earlier in the essay, specifically in the introduction, to guide the reader more effectively through your argumentation. This will ensure that your position is clear from the start.

4. **Argument Support and Structure**: The arguments for both sides of the debate are presented, but their impact could be enhanced by distinguishing more clearly between public benefits and personal viewpoints. The essay tends to merge these aspects, which might confuse readers. Aim for better separation of ideas to maintain focus in each paragraph. Using separate sentences to introduce contrasting opinions could help in this regard and would make your arguments easier to follow.

To improve, consider revising your introduction to include your personal stance clearly and without repeating the task requirements. Work on sentence structure to avoid run-on sentences and overuse of commas. Be sure to differentiate clearly between the general discussion and your personal views throughout, using distinct sentences and paragraphs as appropriate.

By addressing these points, you can make your essay clearer, more direct, and more persuasive, thereby likely increasing your score for both coherence and grammatical range and accuracy.",4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

To come to this point, there are many reason which can be talked about but it is worth noticing that the large concentration of people has led to the rapid spread of strange viruses, thereby creating a serious pandemic. In terms of giving solution, security establishment should be tightened and manage strictly. This essay will elaborate these ideas in details below. \n Definitely, the contaminate of some viruses has strongly affected the development of host countries. Despite the fact that the disease's symptoms have been announced, it is difficult to determine whether or not a person is afflicted. In a little more details, doctors must conduct at least two tests before concluding that a patient is ill. As a result, receiving a high number of international visitors with the potential for disease outbreaks will be challenging for governments. For instance, the corona virus has its origins in Wuhan, China and then quickly spread to the rest of the world due to a huge number of flights and voyages from and to there. After just two years the pandemic has been expanding and evolving into stronger forms of the virus. \n With respect to changing the perspective above, it is suggested that host nations implement rigorous security regulations and medical procedures in densely populated areas. Thereby, officials may more closely monitor the visitors to their nation and enhance the possibilities of controlling or identifying the sickness. As an evidence, according to WHO reports, the danger of infection has been lowered to only 25% by strengthening security and social distancing. In addition, the government should increase laws and punishments in order to promote public awareness about disease prevention. Thanks to these radical measures, governments can now allow international visitors to come and be more assured about dealing with a potential pandemic in the future. \n In conclusion, diseases brought by foreign tourists have raised concerns among countries due to the severe aftermaths. Nevertheless, improving medical and security measures is critical to dealing with and preventing this problem. It is strongly recommended that countries all over the world invest in this problem to guarantee both their people and tourists a secure and healthy future.","I am unsure as to whether you are on topic with this topic or not due to the missing prompt statement. There are several prompts in relation to international tourism. That is why it is important that the original topic and writing instructions be included with the response essay post. There is no available prompt that refers to a pandemic discussion. It is more than likely that the writer misrepresented the original discussion by creating a totally different topic. Which would limit the TA score due to an inaccurate restatement. If I am right, then there is a likelihood the discussion responses may be incorrect as well. Again, the lack of proper topic presentation and writing guidelines limit the assessment I can provide for this essay.","The essay presents an argument regarding the impact of foreign tourists on the spread of diseases and suggests measures to control potential pandemics. However, there are several points to consider for improvement to make the essay more effective and aligned with typical writing prompts for English proficiency tests.

**Response to Topic:** 
- Without the original prompt, it's challenging to assess the direct relevance of the essay. Ensure that your essay closely follows the prompt's requirements. If the original topic was about the effects of international tourism, focusing solely on health risks without addressing other aspects might not fully align with the prompt. It's crucial to cover all parts of the question asked.

**Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** 
- There are minor spelling and grammatical errors that need attention. For instance, ""concider"" should be ""consider,"" ""contaminate"" as used should be ""contamination,"" and ""reason"" should be ""reasons.""
- Some sentences are complex and could be simplified for clarity. For example, the sentence structure in ""For instance, the corona virus has its origins in Wuhan, China and then quickly spread..."" could be simplified to improve readability.
- Be consistent with terminology, such as ""corona virus"" should be ""coronavirus.""

**Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** 
- The point of view is clear but could be strengthened by directly stating the essay's stance at the beginning and ensuring each paragraph supports this perspective cohesively.

**Arguments and Support:** 
- While the essay provides examples, such as the reference to the coronavirus pandemic, including more varied evidence could strengthen the argument. This can include statistics, studies, or historical examples relating to other aspects of international tourism.
- The solutions proposed need to be connected more explicitly to how they address the specific problems raised. For example, explain how ""rigorous security regulations and medical procedures"" can effectively prevent the spread of diseases by tourists.
- Provide clear and descriptive arguments by breaking down complex ideas into more straightforward statements for easier understanding.

**Overall Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Ensure the essay directly answers the specific prompt given for the assignment.
- Work on simplifying sentence structures for better clarity and editing for spelling and grammatical accuracy.
- Enhance the coherence of the essay by clearly linking solutions to the identified problems and ensuring each paragraph contributes effectively to the argument.
- Expand on the argument by incorporating a broader range of evidence and discussing the topic from multiple angles, if applicable to the prompt.

Almostly, people believe that living in this modern century is better than the previous. From my point of view, I totally agree with this statement. \n To begin with, there are several reasons why the quality of life these days is better than before. For the first reasons, nowadays, life provides many modern and technical facilities and equipment, which make many career's fields easier and save a lot of money for hiring staff or workers. For example, a factory does not need to have a large number of workers, they need to have only some special machines for their own industries to produce and remain the company without a lot of money to pay salaries for agents. \n Secondly, living in this period, children mostly have a chance to learn in school, no matter your age or sex, all of them have the same educational curriculum and opportunity for working.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the essay further.

1. **Introduction and Thesis Statement:** The introduction does a basic job of presenting the essay's main argument. However, to strengthen the essay, consider adding a thesis statement at the end of the introduction. This statement should outline the key reasons that will be discussed, providing a clearer roadmap for the reader.

2. **Essay Length and Development:** The current essay is concise and needs further development to thoroughly explore the topic. Expanding on the provided reasons with more detailed examples and explanations could increase the effectiveness of the argument. Aim for an essay length that is closer to 275 words, but try not to exceed 300 words. This will not only provide a more comprehensive discussion but could also potentially improve the essay's score.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are a few errors in spelling (""Almostly"" should be ""Almost""), grammar, and style that need attention. For instance, consider revising phrases for clarity and correctness. Additionally, avoiding repetition and varying sentence structure can make the essay more engaging to read.

4. **Clarity of Point of View and Arguments:** The essay successfully communicates a clear point of view, arguing that life in the modern era is better than in the past. To build on this, ensure that each argument is backed by specific and descriptive examples. For example, when discussing technological advancements, mentioning specific technologies and their impacts can make your argument more convincing.

5. **Handling Examples:** When providing examples, such as the improved access to education for children today, make sure these examples are fully developed to showcase how they support the main argument. Explaining the significance of these examples in the broader context of improving the quality of life will strengthen the essay's persuasive power.

I am referring to the second paragraph where you cannot seem to get out of the explanation that the government should provide quality healthcare for all the citizens of your country. I believe that the problem stems from a lack of understanding of the prompt requirements.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Without the exact prompt, it's difficult to assess if the essay thoroughly addresses the specific requirements. It's essential for an essay to directly respond to the given question or topic. In future essays, ensure that your response clearly aligns with the prompt's instructions and scope.

2. **Cohesion and Coherence:** The essay struggles with organization and clarity. A clearer structure, with distinct paragraphs each introducing a separate idea gradually building upon the initial argument, would enhance readability. Avoid repeating the same point. Instead, offer new information or perspectives in each paragraph to maintain the reader's interest and keep the argument progressing.

3. **Grammar and Style:** There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases that disrupt the flow. Paying attention to sentence structure can help. For example, ""Despite the providing of partial medical care from our country"" could be simplified to ""Despite our country providing partial medical care."" Simplifying language not only helps with clarity but also makes the essay more accessible to readers.

4. **Point of View and Arguments:** Your point of view is evident; you advocate for government-provided healthcare for all. However, make sure your arguments are consistently supporting this viewpoint. The transition from discussing the government's responsibility to individuals' responsibility for healthcare funding is a bit abrupt and contradictory. Clarify your stance on who should bear the primary responsibility for healthcare costs, and ensure each argument logically supports your viewpoint without contradicting earlier statements.

5. **Development of Arguments:** Expand on your arguments to make them more compelling. For example, when mentioning that ""different people have different requirements,"" further explain why a one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare is insufficient. Use examples or data to validate your points, making them more persuasive.

6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion effectively restates the essay's central message, emphasizing the importance of universal healthcare. However, it could be strengthened by summarizing the key arguments presented in the essay, providing a concise and powerful ending.

While the effort to tackle this topic is commendable, there are several key areas that require attention and improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of areas for improvement:

1. **Response to the Topic:** It's crucial to start your essay with a clear introduction that outlines the topic and sets the stage for the discussion. The introduction should rephrase the prompt and give a brief overview of what the essay will cover. The essay lacks a clear paraphrasing of the topic, making it difficult for readers to grasp the central theme immediately. Ensure to include some background information or a more explicit statement of what the essay intends to discuss regarding the media's effect on relationships.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** While the essay demonstrates an effort to engage with complex topics, numerous spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues hinder its readability and clarity. Pay attention to verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and the proper structuring of sentences to avoid confusion. Avoiding run-on sentences and fragments will also improve the essay's flow. Moreover, the use of the first-person perspective ('I think') should be approached with care, ensuring it's appropriately positioned within the essay.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** While the essay attempts to present a point of view, namely that the author disagrees with the viewpoint that media only has negative impacts on relationships, this perspective could be more clearly and strongly stated. Enhancing the clarity and presence of your stance throughout the essay, especially in the introduction and conclusion, will make your argument more compelling.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay mentions both negative and positive aspects of media use, yet it struggles with organizing these points coherently. To improve, dedicate separate paragraphs to discuss the pros and cons distinctly, providing clear examples and reasons for each point. This separation will help in making the essay structured and the arguments easy to follow. Include specific, relevant examples to support your arguments, and ensure each paragraph logically transitions to the next.

5. **Conclusion:** The concluding paragraph should summarize the main points discussed and reinforce the author's viewpoint. It should be a decisive statement of your stance rather than introducing new information or appearing as another argumentative paragraph.

To enhance your writing skills, focus on creating a clear outline before writing, which includes an introduction, body paragraphs each dedicated to a specific point (pros and cons), and a clear conclusion.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some sentences are confusing and disrupt the flow of reading. For example, ""People have a linking for it are shown in how they decorate their house…"" could be clarified to ""People show their preference for certain colors in the way they decorate their homes…"". Avoiding informal language like ""etc."" and ensuring proper sentence structure will also improve clarity.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some recurring mistakes, such as the confusion between ""effect"" and ""affect."" ""Effect"" is a noun meaning the result of something, while ""affect"" is a verb meaning to influence something. Additionally, consistency in American or British English spelling of ""color/colour"" should be maintained throughout the essay. 

5. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: While the essay mentions how color can influence emotions and the design of spaces, these points are not fully developed. Providing more detailed examples and exploring why certain colors have specific effects could strengthen your arguments. Also, consider integrating scientific studies or statistics to support your claims.

6. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay does present a consistent point of view, asserting the importance of color in affecting mood and environments. Making your thesis statement more explicit in the introduction could further clarify your stance.

7. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should not only summarize the essay's main points but also reinforce the significance of the argument. Expanding it to reflect on the broader implications of your discussion can make the conclusion more impactful.

I strongly believe that using e-books will be beneficial to the readers due to its practicality as well as the environment, although some believe it comes along with a certain health issue. \n The development of technology introduces a new way of presenting literature known as an electronic book, which has two main benefits. Firstly, this method provides readers a more practical way of gathering information from books, allowing them to bring their books more easily. For example, students often find it hard to bring all of the paper resources they need, which is normally large and heavy, to attend the lecture. By using e-books, however, it is possible for them to bring countless books stored in a small electronic device, such as phone. Moreover, the change from paper to digital books will obviously decrease the paper usage and thus saving natural resources and protecting the world ecosystem. \n On the other hand, some view that reading an electronic book causes eye problems. The reason behind this is that it has a small display screen and emits a harmful radiation to the eye. That activity is not just the one to blame though. Reading a paper book excessively in the dark, for instance, also lead to the similar problem. With regards to this, as long as the reader maintain a good reading habit, the effect can be prevented, I suppose. \n To sum up, digital books bring positive impacts on both people and surroundings.

So the response should have been: \n <em>Based on 2 comparative factors, I believe that the help offered by the eBooks are greater than the problems that using it poses.</em> \n What you said was: <em>I strongly believe that using e-books will be beneficial to the readers due to its practicality as well as the environment, although some believe it comes along with a certain health issue.</em> \n Since this is not a degree of dis/agreement essay, your response will be considered incorrect as it shows that you did not understand the correct format for the response. Points will be deducted from the TA score because of this error. Remember, in the paraphrase, your restate the prompt and answer the question. Nothing more is required from you. At that point, your English comprehension skills are being tested, so prove that you understand English instructions and that you are capable of explaining English discussion points in your own words. Your own words have to reflect the correct topic and reason for discussion elements. That is why you only have 5 sentences to use in the paragraph. The actual discussion starts after the comprehension skills test. \n Never use terms of uncertainty in this essay. ""I suppose"" indicates that you do not really believe what you are saying. It creates a tangential response which could adversely affect your TA score.","The essay successfully addresses the topic of digital versus print books, presenting a clear position favoring digital books. However, the essay's structure and response to the prompt question need improvement to more precisely align with the expected response format for a comparative analysis essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The prompt requires a direct comparison where one side is clearly favored over the other based on specific factors. Instead of stating a general preference for e-books due to their practicality and environmental benefits, the essay should explicitly compare these advantages against the disadvantages, concluding that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. An improved response might be: ""Considering the ease of access and environmental benefits, the advantages of e-books significantly overshadow the minor issue of potential eye strain.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay is well-written but there are minor grammatical issues and instances where clarity could be enhanced. For example, avoiding terms of uncertainty such as ""I suppose"" would strengthen assertions. Additionally, ensuring subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""that activity is not just the one to blame"" could be revised to ""those activities are not the only ones to blame"") and consistently using plural or singular nouns (""e-books"" instead of switching between ""e-book"" and ""e-books"") would improve readability.

3. **Clearness of the Point of View:** The point of view is clear; the author believes in the benefits of digital books. However, expressing this viewpoint within the specified comparison structure would make the argument stronger. Avoid phrases that indicate uncertainty to convey confidence in the stated position.

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Support:** The essay provides good examples and reasons in support of the preference for digital books, like portability and environmental considerations. Yet, to enhance the argumentative strength, compare these positives directly with the negatives associated with digital books, providing a balanced analysis before concluding that the positives indeed outweigh the negatives.

In summary, focusing on explicitly comparing the advantages and disadvantages of e-books as per the essay prompt, avoiding uncertainty in your language, and making minor grammatical adjustments will significantly improve the clarity and persuasiveness of the argument. Remember to restate the prompt in your own words, understanding the specific response format required, to demonstrate comprehension fully and effectively communicate your point of view.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

What are the causes of these pressures and what measures should be taken to reduce these pressures?","There is no doubt that family and society are putting more and more burden over young people with the expectation of growth in education, social development and financial matters. This essay will address some of the root cause of rising in standard of identity and propose solutions to these problems. \n Firstly, the cause for this matter is that aspects such as academic knowledge, communication, and financial matter are often considered as criteria to judge the ability to move forward of an individual, therefore people believe putting pressure on those aspects will act as a motivation for children in order to bring up the general life of society. For specific, after many centuries of development, life in general always has the tendency to move up, therefore it is reasonable for parents and society to put more desire to grow onto children with the hope that they will bring about more innovation into the world. \n How to cut back on pressure over young people is what need to be concentrated on today. Proposing a solution for this problem could be let children sprout in their own way. Furthermore, adults should shift their focus to self-identity which is also known as allowing children to discover their own potential during their growing up. In this way, young people will have the opportunity to learn more about their personalities and what to do in the future that suits best with them. \n In conclusion, the problem that many children have to be under pressure from aspects such as education, social and commercial expectation could be resonated in desire to better of adults and the pressures would likely reduce by letting children free to grow.","Dear student, my style of helping students who as for a score is to score you on an individual basis so that I can fully explain how you made the mistake and how you can fix it. Based on this essay, I can see your potential as an writer and the problems you currently have which you need to address. \n Let me start by saying that you need to understand the difference between an ordinary opinion essay and a direct opinion essay. The IELTS test Task 2 is always a single opinion essay unless varied by 2 methods. The first variation is the ""compare and contrast"" essay and the other, is the ""direct question , direct response"" essay. The prompt you were provided with falls under the latter description. So, where is the problem then with your essay? \n A direct response / opinion essay requires you to immediately start the discussion in the opening paraphrase by allowing you to outline the 3 discussion points that you wish to present in the body of paragraphs. Here lies the difference with the other task 2 essays which do not allow you to begin the opinion discussion in the first paragraph. In the direct question essay, your must outline your response as part of your thesis statement in relation to its positioning in the body paragraphs presentation. The format that you followed here was the one for the ordinary essay opinion discussion. Please remember this difference for your future reference. \n Now for the scoring section of your essay. My scoring for this will be as follows: \n TA - 5 - you present relevant ideas in the discussion but these ideas are not totally threshed out in the presentation. The reasoning presented is limited in scope and does not always connect within the overall discussion. Using more transition sentences at the end of the paragraphs should help resolve this issue. Make sure that all of the discussion points presented in the prompt are appropriately responded to. \n C&C - 5 - You need to learn to develop your discussions in a more believable manner. The best way to do this is by presenting a singular discussion topic per paragraph. That way you have 4 sentences with which to fully explain yourself and why you support such a statement. What I read in this essay are all reference points for discussions which were never fully developed for the benefit of the reader. The reasoning is weak and the supporting statements require further explanations. \n LR - 5 - There are errors in your word formation and usage which affect the timeline (tense presentation) in the essay. This makes it very difficult for the reader to make sense of your paragraphs. \n GRA - 5 - your grammatical errors stemming from inappropriate word usage and sentence formation problems. You do not really have a proper mix of simple and complex sentence structures. Long sentences (run-on) that combine 2 ideas in one statement, separated by commas make it difficult to keep track of the message of the sentences and create forgettable paragraphs. This creates confusion for the reader who cannot remember what the discussion topic and reasons were all about. \n Please remember that there is a 3 sentence minimum with a 5 sentence maximum per paragraph presentation. Do not try to include too many ideas in your discussion if you wish to create an understandable and memorable essay discussion.","This essay makes a relevant attempt at discussing the pressures young people face from family and society in terms of education, social development, and financial expectations. It provides a perspective on the issue and suggests potential solutions. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, structure, and effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the topic but lacks a direct response to a specific question. It's essential to clarify the exact question being answered and ensure that the thesis statement directly addresses this question right from the introduction. Try to outline the main points or arguments in the introduction to guide the reader through the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay shows issues with word formation, tense consistency, and sentence structure, making some parts confusing. Aim for a mix of simple and complex sentences while avoiding overly long sentences that can be hard to follow. Ensure that each sentence clearly conveys your idea without combining multiple thoughts that could muddle the message.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: While the essay presents a general stance on the pressure imposed on the youth, it does not thoroughly develop a strong, personal viewpoint. Enhancing the clarity of your position on this issue will strengthen your essay. Make your stance clear in the thesis statement and maintain this perspective consistently throughout the essay.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: The essay introduces several arguments but falls short in fully developing these ideas. To strengthen your essay, focus on presenting one main idea per paragraph and explore this idea in depth, supported by specific examples or evidence. This method will make your arguments more convincing and easier for the reader to follow.

Additionally, understanding the difference between various types of essays, particularly for IELTS task 2, is crucial. Identify whether the task requires a direct response to a question, a discussion, or a comparison, and adjust your approach accordingly. The essay seems to follow a more general discussion format rather than providing direct responses as required for some prompts.

Finally, aim to use transitions effectively to connect your ideas and paragraphs smoothly. This will help in creating a cohesive and coherent argument throughout the essay. Remember, each paragraph should ideally have a minimum of three sentences and a maximum of five, focusing on a single idea to avoid overcrowding your discussion with too many unexplored points.

In summary, focus on strengthening the direct response to the essay question, clarifying the point of view, enhancing the argument development, and addressing grammatical and stylistic issues. With these adjustments, the essay will become more coherent, persuasive, and aligned with the expectations for English proficiency tests.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

The reason that I scored you within that bracket is because the essay has good topic sentences but you do not know how to properly present your discussion so that your thought process is clear and understandable to the reader. You have clear problems with cohesiveness and coherence in all your sentences because you are always missing a clear topic sentence and, there are times when it seems like you are presenting a sentence from the middle, instead from the start of the thought development presentation.

Here are some detailed points to help you improve your essay and aim for a higher score:

1. **Response to Topic**: You've chosen a pertinent topic and presented both sides of the argument, which aligns well with the initial task. It's crucial, though, to ensure that your introduction more clearly outlines these views before delving into the discussion. Your thesis statement should offer a hint of your conclusion to guide readers through your essay.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your sentences and paragraphs show an attempt to present complex ideas, but sometimes these ideas become unclear due to sentence structure issues. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea you will discuss. Avoid jumping into thoughts or examples without properly introducing them. Practice writing sentences that start from the beginning of a thought and gradually build up to present the entire idea clearly. This will help in making your arguments more understandable.

3. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Spelling and grammar are areas for improvement. Errors in these areas can disrupt the flow of your essay and make your arguments harder to follow. Consider simple exercises like filling in the blanks and reconstructing sentences to enhance your grammar and sentence development skills. Reading articles in English and summarizing them in your own words can also be beneficial. Focus on forming simple, complete sentences before moving on to complex structures.

4. **Developing Arguments**: While you've mentioned several key points supporting both perspectives, delve deeper into these arguments by providing specific examples or evidence. A statement becomes much stronger if followed by an example that illustrates your point clearly. For instance, when discussing the importance of experience in certain fields, offering a real-world example can make your argument more persuasive.

5. **Point of View**: Your essay's final paragraph attempts to provide a personal perspective, which is good. However, to make your viewpoint stand out more distinctly, support it with reasons and possibly personal or observed examples. This personal touch will make your conclusion more impactful.

6. **Stylistic Issues**: Pay attention to the flow between sentences and paragraphs. Transitional phrases can help with the essay's smoothness and readability. At times, your essay might seem a bit disjointed, which makes it hard for readers to follow your train of thought. Consistent practice in writing and reading can significantly improve this.

In summary, your essay has a strong foundation with its critical engagement with the topic. The primary areas for improvement include clarifying your argumentation, enhancing sentence structure, and polishing grammar. Continuous practice, especially with exercises tailored to address these issues, will undoubtedly help you achieve your targeted score.

As technology accelerates at breakneck speed, the various sectors of the world become more interdependent. "" Multinational corporations manufacture products in many countries and sell them to consumers around the world. Money, technology and raw materials are moving ever faster across national borders"" (globalpolicy.org). Nevertheless, it is not only those tangible elements that quickly transcend borders: ideas, rituals, and cultures cross boundaries rapidly, and so that more policies and social movements develop on the international stage. The globalisation of today is not the globalisation of 70 years ago. Much of 20th-century globalisation directly relates to the Industrial Revolution and the transportation of goods across borders (Baldwin, 2018). The development of globalisation has many features that have been made since the 1980s. The emerging trends that contributed include the interconnection in the sense of markets, consumer tastes, and how finance is done. The strong influence of technology is a vital development that has to affect New Zealand (NZ) international business. Firstly, this essay will discuss the main features of the development of globalisation since the 1980s. Lastly, the implications that these developments have for NZ international businesses.","You cannot jump from first to last without representing the discussion topics in between. You have the right idea, an over extended idea, but not enough of a thesis statement or personal abstract idea to represent the discussion flow of your research paper. I would not go with a century reference in this presentation. Globalisation is happening year on year so maybe, do with decades as a time description instead? Also, Maybe refer to a history of globalisation in New Zealand as part of the study? If you can present the history of globalisation in the country and the need for it to continue to grow as a part of the thesis statement, then you should develop a better thesis statement.","The essay begins with a broad perspective on globalization and its acceleration due to technological advancements, touching upon the increased interdependence of economic sectors worldwide. This introduction sets a relevant context for discussing the specific developments in globalization since the 1980s and their impact on New Zealand (NZ) international businesses.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay addresses the prompt by outlining an intention to discuss the main features of globalization's development since the 1980s and its repercussions for NZ international businesses. However, to strengthen the response to the topic, it would be helpful to include a clear thesis statement early in the essay. This statement should summarize your unique perspective or argument regarding how globalization has developed and affected NZ businesses. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally understandable but would benefit from attention to detail in spelling and grammar, including the correction of ""affect"" to ""effect"" when discussing impacts on NZ businesses. Additionally, structuring the essay with clear, distinct paragraphs for each main point would improve readability and coherence. 

3. **Author’s Point of View**: While the essay hints at a perspective that globalization has significantly impacted NZ businesses through technological advancements and market connections, this viewpoint could be made clearer. Developing a strong thesis statement, as mentioned, would greatly clarify the author's stance.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay mentions several key elements, such as multinational corporations, technology, and the historical context of globalization. However, the arguments would be strengthened by more directly connecting these elements to NZ international businesses. For instance, specific examples of how technology has influenced NZ companies or how these companies have adapted to global market trends since the 1980s would make the argument more persuasive and compelling.

**Additional Suggestions**:

- Consider narrowing the focus to specific decades, as globalization progresses year by year. This approach can provide a clearer framework for your discussion and allow for a more detailed analysis of the changes and trends over time.

- Incorporating a brief history of globalization in New Zealand and discussing the country's evolving role in the global market could enrich the essay. This addition would not only contextualize NZ's international business landscape but also provide a solid foundation for your thesis.

- Ensure that each point made is followed by evidence or examples, especially when making claims about the impact of globalization. This strategy will make your argument more robust and convincing.

By refining the thesis statement, improving structure and clarity, and providing specific examples related to NZ, the essay could offer a comprehensive and insightful analysis of globalization's developments since the 1980s and their impact on NZ international businesses.",3,4,3,4,2,3,3,3,2,1,Informative
4796,https://essayforum.com/writing/english-persuasive-lying-74098/,dev,English Essay: Persuasive Essay on Lying,"The definition of a lie entails the action of telling an intentionally false statement. Lying is part of human nature. We learn to do so from the moment we can talk and as we grow older, it begins to function more as a second language. We all know liars, and the vast majority of us lie from time to time. Of course, lying does not always attribute to dishonesty, untrustworthiness, or deceit, like we were taught early in our education. In fact, of the 200 lies we are exposed to every day, a fair fraction of them are harmless. We tell these types lies to help another person, or to avoid inflicting hurt feelings. Other times, we lie for the benefit of ourselves, without harming others. \n Lying has been always seen as morally wrong, however, there is a multitude of situations where lying is highly justifiable. \n A white lie is defined as a harmless or trivial untruth that is usually told to avoid hurting someone's feelings. In many cases, white lies may be more beneficial compared to the truth. It can prevent unreasonable quarrels between people and leave both sides satisfied. For instance, if you receive a gift that you are not very satisfied with, you would be justified in lying and convincing the other party that you are happy with what you received. If you were to reveal your true feelings instead, you could create future conflict and gain a negative reputation from your peers. In this situation, telling a white lie would have lead to the most positive outcome. \n Lying in specific scenarios in order to delay pain or suffering (emotional or physical) may also be justifiable. Sometimes, this may involve lying to a child. If you are given the task to talk to a young child about the death of their loved one, it would be better to lie and give them a scenario that they can cope with and process. The young brain has yet to develop the ability to digest such horrors, so in some cases, it might be better to gloss things over. Lying with the purpose of protecting or delaying a painful situation can be kinder to the receiver than just telling the truth when they may not be ready to hear it. \n Moreover, telling a lie to save a life is also acceptable. For example, in a medical situation where a patient enters an operation that can cause him his life, lying about the survival rates can encourage the patient to push to fight for his life. In the case of war, lying to the enemy in a prisoner of war scenario can potentially save the lives of you and your peers. When you have the potential to prevent death through lying, it is completely warranted. \n Ever since we were young, we were always taught that honesty is the best policy, and lying is something we should avoid. Whilst this holds some truth, being completely honest is not always the right decision to make. If you were to take anything from this, it should be that telling a lie in certain situations would bring better prospects than speaking the truth.","Rose, actually, your paper is not properly representing the discussion of lies. You say that there are times when lying is justifiable, I will admit that there are situations when that is correct. The problem is, you are not properly categorizing lies in your essay. You speak of white lies only as the focus of your essay. In order to properly support your opinion, you should have used the more professional types of lies which are as follows: \n 1. Lies of Commission - This is when someone tells something that is not a fact. This is also known as twisting the truth. \n 2. Lies of Omission - Is when you leave out an important part of information. This is usually easier to tell for people because it entails only telling half the truth. \n Had you used the correct professional classification of lies in support of your evidence, the essay would have become more authoritative and shown that you did deeper research for this paper instead of just using the first result that turned up in a Google search.","The essay submitted explores the concept of lying and argues that in some cases, lying is justifiable. This topic is indeed well-aligned with discussions on moral philosophy and human behavior, which makes it a relevant and interesting essay theme. The essay begins with a general definition of lying and transitions into discussing specific scenarios where lying could be considered justifiable or even beneficial. The focus on 'white lies' serves to illustrate the author's stance that not all lies are harmful. This choice of topic and approach addresses the essay prompt effectively, engaging with a complex moral issue with clarity.

One of the strengths of this essay is its clear structure; it progresses logically from introducing the concept of a lie to detailed examples of situations where lying might be seen as the better choice. This progression helps readers follow the argument more easily. Furthermore, the examples provided are relatable and effectively illustrate the points being made.

However, the essay would benefit significantly from including a broader categorization of lies. Currently, the discussion primarily revolves around 'white lies.' Expanding the scope to include more professional types of lies, such as 'lies of commission' (where an untruth is told) and 'lies of omission' (where crucial information is left out), would not only enrich the essay by showing a deeper understanding of the subject but also provide a more nuanced view of the morality of lying. By incorporating these concepts, the argument would be grounded in a more comprehensive exploration of dishonesty, enhancing its credibility and depth.

Moreover, there are some areas where the essay could be improved stylistically and grammatically. While the essay is mostly clear, minor errors in spelling and grammar can distract from the argument being made. Paying closer attention to these details would improve the overall readability and professionalism of the essay.

In terms of clarity and descriptiveness, the essay successfully communicates its main points and provides supporting arguments for its stance. However, the point of view could be articulated more compellingly by explicitly stating the criteria for when lying might be considered 'justifiable' early in the essay. This would set clearer expectations for the reader and strengthen the argumentative framework of the essay.

The essay presents a well-argued case for the justifiability of lying under specific circumstances. To enhance this argument further, it's recommended to incorporate a broader classification of lies and to scrutinize the moral implications of each category. This approach, coupled with careful proofreading to eliminate spelling and grammatical errors, would elevate the quality of the essay, making it more persuasive and engaging.

By addressing these aspects, the essay would not only appeal to a wider audience but also demonstrate a deeper engagement with the complexities of human ethics and behavior.",3,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,1,Argumentative

The responsibility of corporation towards society and environment is inevitable, as use of resources from the society and environment and role of corporation in shaping society make corporation morally obliged to contribute for society. \n Because society is supreme need of corporation, corporation can't ignore them. The corporations such as factories, industries use various resources from the environment like air, water, raw materials and society- manpower, and earn benefits from it.

The corporation has to look after the worker and family members. Moreover, the corporations are also threat to society and environment. Unlike old generation, corporations, nowadays, are big, use much resource, and produce much pollution. Being unconcerned about their effects, corporation can further aggravate the issue. So corporations should be responsible for the society and environment. For instance, TATA steels of India, allocate 2 percent of company profit to check the environmental deterioration, promote health status of society members. \n However, some may assert that sole role of corporation it to earn money, but they forget that the corporation earns money from utilization of society and surrounding. If the company acts for profit purpose only, without alleviating various environmental caused by it, then there is a chance of hostility between corporation and society. Such companies are likely to downfall. They are many companies which are closed due to such reason. In the other hands, participating in environmental developmental plan and health plan, corporations are likely to have good reputation. Such reputation is required for sustainability and prosperity of corporation itself. \n In conclusion, corporation engagement in development of society and surrounding are not avoidable as it benefits greatly from society and surrounding, possess greater hazard to environment and helps to develop affable relationship.

However, there are several key areas where your essay could be improved to better meet the requirements of the essay prompt and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
Your essay does delve into the topic of corporate responsibility towards society and the environment. Nonetheless, your presentation could be structured more effectively to align with the expectations of the prompt. Initially, presenting a clear thesis statement that outlines your position on the topic is essential. This statement should come at the beginning of your essay to guide the reader through your discussion. Instead of saving your point of view for the conclusion, introduce it early on to set the stage for your arguments.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
While your essay communicates your ideas, there are several instances of grammatical and stylistic errors that could hinder comprehension. For instance, pay attention to article usage (""a"", ""the""), subject-verb agreement, and the correct use of prepositions. Additionally, choosing simpler language could help in making your arguments more accessible to the reader. Also, ensure to maintain a formal tone throughout, avoiding colloquial expressions.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
Your point of view on the responsibility of corporations towards society is evident but could be articulated more clearly. Positioning your thesis statement at the beginning, as mentioned, will help clarify your stance from the outset. It would also be beneficial to more distinctly acknowledge opposing viewpoints before presenting your own perspective, to create a balanced argument.

4. **Arguments Supporting Your Position:**
Your essay includes several arguments that support your view, such as the moral obligation of corporations to contribute to society and the environment, and examples of successful corporate strategies. To strengthen these arguments, consider providing more detailed examples, statistics, or research findings. Additionally, discussing the counterargument more thoroughly before refuting it can enrich your essay by showcasing a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

- Start your essay with a clear thesis statement reflecting your point of view.
- Structure your essay to first briefly acknowledge the opposing viewpoint, then detail your own arguments, and conclude by reinforcing your position without introducing new information.
- Simplify your language for better accessibility and understanding.
- Correct grammatical and stylistic errors to enhance readability.

Do you agree? \n One school of thought that the government should no longer spend their funding to maintain activities of art and culture. This essay aims to shed light on the reasons why I completely disagree with this way of thinking. \n To begin with, using the funding of government for supporting art and cultural activities create a foundation for patriotism, national self-reliance, the strength of great national unity and the desire to develop the country into prosperity. The government spend amount of money for art and cultural activities which also help to preserve and promote the tradition and culture beauties of each nation. For example, most countries in Asia has traditional occasion which is Lunar New Year, each of country has many activities to welcome a new year with all the luck \n In addition, using the funding of the government motivate them to promote their art and culture in sustainable and effective ways, this create a foundation to encourage the tourism industry which helping the national economy exponentially. For instance, Vietnam is a country having many famous traditional culture places such as Hoi An ancient town or Hoa Lu ancient capital where tourists come to learn and experience unique customs. \n In conclusion, it seems to me that the funding of the government should use for maintaining art and cultural activities, it also helps to keep the culture and art of each nation from disappearing and affirming the unique traditions of each region.","<quotation>why I completely disagree</quotation> \n Do not exaggerate your response. Know when to use a measured response to the question and when not to. If you do not see the question indicating ""To what extent"", then a simple agree or disagree response is expected. As it is, the essay is not in the expected response format so you might get a slight penalty in the preliminary TA score. \n The tendency of your presentation is to take on a run-on format. That means, you are using long sentences that combine at least 2 ideas in one sentence. Avoid doing that since it creates GRA deductions for you. Always separate the ideas in the presentation. You may use transition sentences or phrases within the paragraph to achieve that separate, but connected reasoning presentation.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by presenting a clear stance that government funding should be used to support art and cultural activities. The argument is that such funding promotes patriotism, cultural preservation, and tourism, which benefits the national economy. This position is maintained throughout the essay, making the point of view clear and consistent.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made:

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay directly addresses the question, the language used (""completely disagree"") appears too strong for the question asked. The question does not ask ""to what extent"" you agree or disagree, implying that a simple agreement or disagreement would suffice. It's important to match your response's intensity to the question's requirements to avoid being marked down.

2. **Writing Style and Grammar**: The essay tends to use long sentences that combine multiple ideas, which can lead to confusion and make the text less coherent. It's better to break down complex ideas into shorter sentences, ensuring each one conveys a single point. This will not only improve readability but also help in clearly presenting your arguments. Additionally, there are minor grammatical issues, such as subject-verb agreement (""countries in Asia has"" should be ""countries in Asia have"") and missing articles (""the government spend amount of money"" should be ""the government spends a/an amount of money"").

3. **Clarity and Arguments**: While the essay presents arguments to support the position taken, these could be articulated more clearly and cohesively. Using transitional phrases or sentences can help distinguish between different ideas while maintaining a logical flow. This approach not only enhances the argument's clarity but also reinforces the structure of the essay.

4. **Descriptive and Specific Arguments**: The arguments made in favor of government funding for art and cultural activities could be strengthened by incorporating more specific examples and details. While examples like Lunar New Year and Hoi An ancient town are mentioned, further elaboration on these or additional examples could better illustrate the point. Providing specific evidence and details enriches the argument and makes it more convincing.

In summary, focusing on simplifying and clarifying sentences, adjusting the response's intensity to match the question, and adding more specific examples would greatly improve the essay. These changes would enhance both the readability and persuasiveness of the argument presented.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Firstly, the primary reason is that people have a very hectic schedule because they do not have spare time for their family, so they usually spend this time on recharging and fulfilling energy after tiring days of work. This is also time for meeting up and tightening bonds with their relationships. Besides, Festivals are becoming times for celebration and having parties. For instance, Vietnamese people will make a floating cake, make a tray of rice to offer on the altar, and gather their loved people in the Cold Food festival. \n On the other hand, the merits of traditional and religious festivals are being remembered while there are conflicting opinions. These have been taught from early childhood about the merits of their own orthodox and distinct festivals. Moreover, the significant role of the family in passing knowledge on to the next generations. For example, Vietnamese children are taught the meaning of independent day from a young age, so they can love and be more proud of their country. \n In conclusion, the merits of conventional and religious festivals are participated with many different purposes. However, I still support that people keep the meaning of traditional and spiritual festivals educated and passed when they were a child.","You cannot stand with both opinions in this case. The instruction requires you to choose one opinion and defend it over 2 paragraphs. This error in your presentation will result in a failing TA score for your essay. The basis for the preliminary failing score is the fact that you obviously did not understand the instructions and, you were not able to discuss the essay as expected. You will do well to familiarize yourself with the different response expectations, depending upon the question presented. This is sadly, not a passing score essay. There is no clear writer's opinion based on a single opinion choice. It is not going to get a passing score even if partial grades are given to the non-essential scoring areas.","This essay explores the significance of traditional and religious festivals, discussing both their enjoyment and educational aspects. However, there are several areas where improvements could be made to better align with typical essay expectations for English proficiency tests.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to cover both sides of the topic but lacks a clear stance. The instructions likely asked for a single viewpoint to be chosen and defended throughout the essay. It is crucial to carefully read and understand the assignment's requirements before beginning your essay. Choosing one opinion and consistently supporting it across your paragraphs will not only meet the task's demands but also give your essay a focused and coherent structure.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: While the essay has minimal spelling issues, there are some grammar and stylistic problems. For instance:
   - The essay could benefit from more varied sentence structure to improve readability and flow.
   - Some phrases (""recharging and fulfilling energy,"" ""are participated with"") might be rephrased for clarity, such as ""recharge and replenish energy"" and ""participated in for many different reasons.""
   - Pay attention to the consistency in verb tenses and the clarity of expressions to ensure your message is clear.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay's point of view is somewhat unclear due to the attempt to cover both perspectives of the argument. For a more effective essay, decide on a single viewpoint and articulate it clearly from the beginning. This approach helps to maintain a clear and persuasive position throughout your essay.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: The essay provides some descriptive arguments and examples, particularly when discussing the importance of festivals for family bonding and cultural education. However, these points often straddle both perspectives without decisively supporting a singular stance. To strengthen your essay:
   - Select one viewpoint as your central argument.
   - Use specific examples and clear reasoning to support this viewpoint consistently across all parts of your essay.
   - Each paragraph should introduce a new aspect of your chosen stance, building a strong, unified argument.

In conclusion, focusing on articulating and supporting a single viewpoint will greatly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your essay. Additionally, refining grammar and stylistic choices will further improve readability and the overall impression of your work.

The majority believe that the host country will earn a big economic benefits after the events, while some others argue that they will have to face a risk of crime and vandalism rising rate due to uncontrollable tourism rising rate. Supporting ideas for both views and my opinion will be given below. \n To begin with, although these global events are great opportunities for host countries to increase worldwide exposure, they also are confronted with crucial challenges. Unmanageable tourism could lead to rising rate of pickpocket, demolition and environment ruined in famous destinations. There are some records that after the tourist seasons, the authorities have a to pay a lot of money and attention to fixing and restoration. \n On the other hand, I am of the opinion that benefits that the host countries are getting from world-scaled events overwhelm the throwback they had on environment. By being the host, a country is able to appeal a vast array of visitors and money injections, which push infrastructure, accommodations and public services to be improved, and in a long term, it's a good sign for a country to improve and promote their culture in a global scale. Vietnam during the SEA GAMES 2003, for example, was full of tourists and also known as a must destination for food lovers. This do wonders to Vietnam economy. \n In conclusion, in every international sport events, host countries do have to face challenges but hospitality and economy boosting are way more significant.","The first thing I noticed about this writing was that you only wrote 256 words.

Please try to write a longer essay to merit a better score in the future. \n Reading the prompt paraphrase and writer's opinion, I have to say that I am disappointed as you did not paraphrase the original prompt properly. The original data is not accurately represented. You have included information that belong in the body of the discussion, not in the paraphrasing section. There is also no thesis statement provided. Therefore, The TA score will be a failing one since the paraphrase is not related to the original discussion. This means, based on the word count, and incorrect paraphrasing, the essay is already going to get a final failing score. There are also several other problems existing in the essay but the ones I stated are the reasons why the essay will immediately receive a failing score.","The essay provides an analysis on the impacts of hosting international sports events, focusing on both the economic benefits and the challenges associated with increased tourism. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness of the argument.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay attempts to address the topic, discussing the positive and negative effects of hosting international sports events. However, the introduction does not accurately paraphrase the original prompt, and crucially, it lacks a clear thesis statement. This omission is significant as it leaves readers without a clear understanding of the essay's main argument from the outset. To improve, ensure that the introduction accurately reflects the essay question and includes a thesis statement that outlines the key points that will be discussed.

2. **Length of the Essay**: The essay is relatively short, with only 256 words. For English proficiency tests, essays are generally expected to be between 275 and 300 words. Writing a longer essay allows for a more thorough exploration of the topic and demonstrates your ability to develop and support your ideas more fully. Aim to expand your essay by providing more detailed examples, elaborating on your arguments, or including an additional paragraph that further explores the topic.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few spelling and grammatical errors within the essay. For instance, phrases like ""the majority believe"" should be ""the majority of people believe,"" and ""throwback they had on environment"" should be rephrased for clarity. Additionally, there are instances where word choice can be improved for precision and impact, such as using ""challenges"" instead of ""throwback."" Review your essay for such errors and consider employing tools or resources to help identify and correct them.

4. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The author's point of view becomes clearer towards the end of the essay, favoring the benefits of hosting international sports events. To strengthen the essay, ensure that your position is clearly stated in the introduction alongside the thesis statement. This approach guides the reader through your argumentation more cohesively.

5. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides examples and reasons to support its arguments; however, these could be developed further. For instance, the mention of Vietnam during the SEA GAMES 2003 is a good start, but providing more detailed information about the economic impact or the specific improvements observed could make the argument more convincing. Aim to include more specific details, data, or examples to substantiate your claims.

In summary, to improve the essay, focus on crafting a clear and accurate introduction with a thesis statement, extending the length of the essay to fully develop your arguments, correcting spelling and grammatical mistakes, ensuring the clarity of your viewpoint throughout, and providing more detailed support for your arguments.

4801,https://essayforum.com/writing/school-teach-traditional-subjects-practical-86692/,dev,IELTS - Essay about whether school should teach traditional subjects or practical knowledge.,"Creating a proper curriculum for school is always a matter of many educators. There is an existing idea that a great concentration is made on traditional subjects, which is supposed to be no longer adequate to equip job-orientated skills for students. While many people find feasible subjects lucrative, others insist on the benefits of long-established ones. Pondering upon this issue, I hold a strong interest on the later perception. \n First and foremost, a more secured success in recruitment is what I put in my priority. What students expected to gain after school is high skill of knowledge acquisition, which is highly likely to guarantee successful employment in the future. It cannot be denied that academic basis provided by schools is inevitably pivotal in the modern society. Thanks to schools' priority in primarily focusing on theoretical subjects, students will inaugurate the skills, theories they gain during study progress into practice. For instance, based on different types of writing styles pupils learn at school, they have high skills of writing CV. Therefore, students are offered a great chance of recruitment and become qualified employees. \n The further point holds no less importance in my argument is all-round development of students. Needless to say, traditional subjects play a fundamental role in imparting academic and professional knowledge. First of all, in the process of learning science subjects, such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, critical, analytical thinking skills which are valuable experiences and make individuals dominant in workplace will be promoted. Moreover, studying History will broaden one's horizons on different ancient civilizations motivate them to explore diverse cultures. Similarly, while reading pages in Literature, both vocabulary and imagination will scale up and enhance. By and large, those who attain academic knowledge have irrefutable advantages in the modern working world. \n In conclusion, success in future recruitment and all-round development are tenable reason for my preference. Taking my analysis into meticulous consideration, I believe that students whose have learning spirits will stand more opportunity to glorify their future.","Please remember that this 40 minute task has to be edited and finalized in terms of content. Do not focus on the length of the essay because you run out of time to edit the paper. The mere length will not assure you of an overall passing consideration. You need to leave at least 5 minutes to make sure that there are no spelling errors, no incorrect vocabulary usage, no unclear sentences or paragraphs. You have all of those problems existing in this essay. Had you written an essay between 275-290 words in length, you would have avoided those errors and also allowed yourself some time to perfect the essay content. \n For starters, you did not really respond to the extent question in the essay. What you gave as a response was: \n <em>Pondering upon this issue, I hold a strong interest on the later perception.</em> \n What is the latter perception? Did you even realize that your total paragraph, because of your unreasonable focus on trying to impress the reviewer with your vocabulary, you failed to properly paraphrase the original prompt? You did not express a clear thought in the prompt paraphrase. Your paraphrase even contains information not included in the original prompt. The more appropriate paraphrase would have been: \n <em>Educational institutions tend to focus on conventional learning courses. It is commonly believed that these forms of learning are no longer capable of equipping learners for modern occupational conditions. I strongly agree with this belief for various reasons.</em> \n You have to clearly rephrase the original topic and reason. After that, you give a clear, pointed response to the question posed. That is how you properly paraphrase the original presentation. Your presentation was nowhere near a proper paraphrase because you veered away from the original discussion through the reference to the question of curriculum creation, which wasn't the discussion focus of the essay at all. Hence the improper paraphrase and the confusing response to the question that you created. \n Your discussion topics are incorrect. The ability to write a proper resume has nothing to do with the preparedness of an individual to perform his job. Rather, it is the proper practical training that should be the focus of your discussion at that point. Your second reasoning paragraph is even further off the discussion topic. Your reasons would have probably been more applicable had you provided proper discussion examples and supporting explanations. Right now, all your paragraphs lack clarity and coherence. Which will be main reasons why it will get a low score in the end.","The essay attempts to engage with the prompt around the adequacy of current school curriculums in preparing students for job-oriented skills. However, there are several areas that need improvement to make the essay more effective and aligned with the task requirements. 

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay seems to miss a direct response to the given topic. The introduction vaguely mentions an interest in traditional subjects over more practical ones but doesn't clearly express a stance or directly address the prompt. To improve, start by accurately summarizing the topic and then clearly state your position. For example, you could say, ""Schools currently emphasize traditional academic subjects, which many believe do not fully prepare students for the workforce. I support this view because...""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are noticeable issues with spelling, grammar, and the use of complex vocabulary that sometimes makes sentences hard to understand. Remember, clarity and precision in language are more important than using advanced vocabulary. Ensure that every sentence conveys a clear meaning and contributes to your argument. Using simpler language can help avoid confusion and make your essay more accessible. Also, allocating the last few minutes of your writing time to proofread can significantly reduce these errors.

3. **Author's Point of View**: While your preference for traditional subjects is mentioned, the reasoning behind this choice is not strongly articulated. Make your point of view clearer by directly stating why you believe traditional subjects are more beneficial for students' future employment opportunities and development. Each paragraph should open with a statement that reflects your view before delving into detailed arguments.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides some general statements about the benefits of traditional subjects but lacks specific examples and clear explanations to support these claims. For instance, saying traditional subjects improve critical thinking is a start, but you need to explain how they do so and why this is important for employment. Also, ensure that your arguments are focused and relevant to the topic. For example, the ability to write a resume, while useful, does not directly address the core skills needed for most jobs. Instead, focus on how traditional education develops critical and analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of various fields—attributes that are valuable in the workplace.

By addressing these areas—ensuring a clear response to the prompt, improving language use for clarity, explicitly stating your point of view, and providing detailed support for your arguments—your essay will become more coherent, persuasive, and aligned with the task requirements. Remember, the goal is to present a well-structured and convincing argument within a concise and clear framework.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

While there are some strong arguments that they affect our life in different negative ways, I support the view that the benefits of technological advances far outweigh their drawbacks. \n It is undeniable that technology breakthroughs, such as the manufacturing machines of next generation that installed in warehouses across the world, cause an increasing unemployment rate among blue collar workers. However, I would argue they accelerate the transformation of society and in turn improve the quality of life in the long term. Take the same example, sophisticated machinery perform much better than human in areas where the accuracy is the priority. Careless mistakes in calculation can be avoid, and at the same time, they save us from labour-intensive exercises and let us concentrate on essential creative tasks. \n Alongside advanced computational capabilities, innovations in the field of communication open a new world of opportunities. Thanks to modern connecting software pioneers like Slack and Zoom, a great number of employees manage to work remotely yet together and companies keep operating during the lockdown period.

Do not use that word if you are trying to create a supporting sentence. Learn how to use words properly in the English language.

Hence; ""... sophisticated machinery workS much better..."" . Don't forget to use a comma after a conjunction like ""together , and companies..."" Also, beware of the way you use technical jargon. It is not ""real time date"", it is ""real time DATA"". Again, a grave LR error. \n You must improve your English vocabulary. Make sure you understand the meaning of words before you use it in the essay. Too many point deductions can occur when you do not use the words properly in a sentence.","The essay tackles the topic effectively by acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects of modern innovations but ultimately supporting the benefits these innovations bring. This stance is clear throughout the essay, aligning with the prompt's request for a personal view. However, there are several opportunities for improvement to strengthen the essay's overall quality and coherence.

1. **Sticking to One Side of the Argument:**
The essay introduces a negative aspect of technological advancements in the first reasoning paragraph, which can confuse readers about the writer's stance. It's vital to maintain a consistent position throughout the essay. Instead of presenting a drawback and then countering it with a benefit, focus more on elaborating the positive impacts of technological innovations. This approach will help maintain the essay's cohesiveness and ensure the discussion remains on track.

2. **Correct Word Usage:**
The word ""However"" is used to introduce a counterargument, which might not be the intended purpose in the context it was used. Paying attention to word choice is crucial for clarity and coherence in your essay. Avoid using words that suggest a shift in your argument when your intent is to support a point. Additionally, there's a misapplication of the word ""date"" instead of the correct term ""data."" Such mistakes can affect the perceived accuracy of your essay.

3. **Tense Consistency and Punctuation:**
The essay occasionally shifts tenses improperly. For instance, when discussing the capabilities of sophisticated machinery, the present tense ""works"" should be used to maintain consistency. Moreover, be mindful of punctuation, especially when using conjunctions, to ensure sentences are well-structured and easy to understand. These grammatical details significantly impact the readability of your essay.

4. **Improving Vocabulary and Usage:**
The essay demonstrates a strong command of language in several instances. However, there are moments where the misuse of words can detract from the overall message. Expanding your vocabulary and understanding the nuances of word meanings will greatly enhance your essay. It's important to be sure of a word's definition and appropriate context before incorporating it into your writing to avoid misinterpretation or ambiguity.

By focusing on these key areas—maintaining a consistent argument, proper word usage, tense consistency, and vocabulary improvement—the quality, coherence, and persuasiveness of the essay can be significantly enhanced. These adjustments will not only make the essay more engaging and easier to follow but will also demonstrate a high level of English proficiency and understanding of the essay topic.",3,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, the cost of attending university, which has escalated in recent years, has endangered some valid concerns. It is argued that the government should waive college tuition fees, regardless of a student's socio-economic status. While this thinking is valid to a certain extent, I opine that subsidizing college education would have an adverse bearing on students and society. \n It is understandable why some people subscribe to the view that students should be allowed to pursue tertiary education for free. Proponents of tuition exemption argue that this practice would enable more students, especially the underprivileged, to attend college. which would enable them to obtain a tertiary degree and help university graduates stand a better chance of getting well-paid jobs. Nevertheless, this thinking needs to be revised, since the larger influx of graduates into the labor market is a primary driving force behind the rising of youth unemployment. Therefore, it is apparent that the provision of free-of-charge education is counter-productive to job guarantees. \n Another significant drawback is that the abolition of university tuition could take a toll on students' performance. As today most undergraduates have to pay for their tuition fees, they are inclined to study in earnest to achieve high scores. As a result, students may be indifferent to studying and lose the motivation to work hard if the financial burden no longer exerts a strain on them. For example, they might skip classes or miss exams to spend time working, entertaining, extracurricular activities participating, and some other certifications studying, which is useful for students' future, as they feel that failing does not cost them anything, leading to deteriorating performance and failing to benefit from their education. \n In conclusion, I believe that allotting state funding to cover higher education tuition is not advisable.","The first 2 sentences of the restatement is not related to the given discussion. Points will be deducted due to prompt deviaton. The writer's opinion is not properly formatted. There is no extent description presented prior to the thesis statement of the writer.

That is an error and failing grade that will be difficult to overcome in the discussion portion. \n Discussion wise, you have not really defended a personal opinion in the presentation. What you did was present an explanation for both public perceptions, based on public opinions. So the essay does not pass the personal opinion scoring consideration. The essay could fail based on an irrelevant discussion format.","The essay addresses the question of whether the government should waive college tuition fees. The introduction sets the stage for this debate but strays slightly by not directly addressing the prompt’s primary focus from the beginning. To improve, it's vital to ensure that every sentence in the introduction directly relates to the topic and presents a clear stance. Moreover, explicitly stating your viewpoint upfront would make your position clearer to the reader.

There are instances of minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. For example, ""endangered some valid concerns"" likely intended to say ""engendered some valid concerns,"" as ""endanger"" and ""engender"" have different meanings. Additionally, there's a run-on sentence that could be more effectively broken down for clarity, specifically in the argument about tuition exemption leading to an influx of graduates and the consequences thereof. Using simpler sentences can help in maintaining clarity and ensuring the message isn't lost or misunderstood.

While the essay attempts to present a nuanced view by examining both sides of the argument, it does merit point out that the expression of a personal opinion needs to be more explicit and consistently maintained throughout the essay. It's beneficial to present a thesis statement early on that clearly outlines the essay's stance, and ensure that subsequent paragraphs reinforce this viewpoint with specific, supported arguments.

The discussion of the potential issues with waiving tuition fees – such as the impacts on student motivation and performance – does provide an argumentative basis supporting your viewpoint. However, these points could be strengthened further by including more detailed examples, relevant statistics, or findings from studies to substantiate the claims made. Additionally, some of the arguments are presented somewhat hastily, with critical analysis and depth missing. For instance, exploring why and how free tuition could lead to students valuing their education less would make your argument more compelling.

In conclusion, while the essay does provide an overview of the topic, sharpening the focus on your own viewpoint, refining the clarity of the argument through better structure and grammar, and reinforcing positions with solid evidence would enhance its effectiveness substantially. Crafting a clear and distinct thesis statement at the outset, avoiding deviations from the topic, and refining the articulation of arguments can go a long way in improving the essay's coherence and persuasiveness.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

Unfortunately, this will backfire on you in the actual test because you won't have time to research impressive sounding words. Just speak naturally and used words that you are familiar with. It is best to be scored on the level for information you truly know rather than information that you researched. \n Finally, please make sure to double check for your punctuation placements. There were a few instances when you did not place a period at the end of a sentence leading into a new paragraph. That creates a hanging sentence which would affect your GRA score. Also, you need to provide at least 3 sentences in order to create an acceptable, minimum paragraph. You will lose points for writing less sentences as well. Just don't go over 5 sentences and your score will be acceptable in that area.","The essay demonstrates a commendable effort in tackling the topic of the advantages and disadvantages of living in urban versus small community areas. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity and coherence, and to better meet the expectations of English proficiency tests.

Firstly, the essay misses the mark in accurately responding to the prompt. To more effectively address the topic, the introduction should clearly restate the subject matter by outlining that the discussion will explore both the benefits and drawbacks of residing in smaller communities as opposed to urban areas. An example of a more suitable introduction could be: ""In recent times, there's a noticeable preference for urban living over small community settings, leading to less neighborly familiarity. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of living in smaller, more intimate communities.""

Moreover, the essay employs a variety of complex and antiquated terms such as ""hutment"" and ""burg."" While it is impressive to see a wide range of vocabulary, it is crucial to use words that are commonly understood and part of regular English conversation. Utilizing overly complex or obscure words can detract from the clarity of the argument and may not be practical during a timed exam, where familiarity and ease with the language are paramount.

In terms of grammar and style, the essay exhibits several issues, including inconsistent tense usage, incorrect word choices, and punctuation errors. There are instances where sentences end without punctuation, leading to confusion and a lack of polish. For improvement, focus on using clear and straightforward sentences and ensure that every sentence ends with the appropriate punctuation mark. Additionally, maintaining a consistent tense throughout the essay and choosing the correct words to convey meaning will significantly enhance readability.

Regarding the structure and development of arguments, the essay somewhat identifies the merits and demerits of small community living. However, the points presented lack depth and are not always clearly connected to support the overarching point of view. To strengthen the essay, include specific examples and detailed explanations of why certain aspects are considered advantages or disadvantages. Each paragraph should ideally contain at least three sentences to adequately develop an idea but avoid exceeding five sentences to maintain focus and readability.

To conclude, while the foundation of a compelling discussion is present, focusing on accurately addressing the prompt, simplifying language use, correcting grammatical and punctuation errors, and more clearly structuring arguments will improve the overall effectiveness and coherence of the essay. Remember, clarity and simplicity often outweigh the use of impressive but complex vocabulary.",3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative
4805,https://essayforum.com/writing/music-widely-perceived-power-unite-connect-86913/,dev,Music is widely perceived to have the power to unite and connect humans,"Topic: Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? \n Music is widely perceived to have the power to unite and connect humans, irrespective of their cultural backgrounds and ages. I am, personally, in complete agreement with that notion. \n In the first place, music could transcend cultural boundaries. Such a universal language is it that music could be absorbed by individuals from all four corners of the world. Furthermore, recent researches have indicated that the rhythm helps coordinate and synchronize the audience's body movements. As a result, a sense of group identity is created. For instance, a number of songs which are not written in the lingua franca, such as Despacito with Latin lyrics or Gangnam Style in Korean, have still taken the global entertainment industry by storm. Therefore, fans across continents are connected. \n In addition, music has the capability of connecting generations. Despite the generation gap, the shared feelings among the listeners act as the social glue that augments social relationships. That is the underlying reason why a work of art like Happy Birthday song appears to evoke joyful reactions in both the young and the elderly. Also, in the coronavirus pandemic, various music marathons are organized in order to support frontline healthcare workers, first responders and convey messages of solidarity. Those virtual concerts were not only successful fundraising telethons but also the potent social glue. Hardly has any art form been able to be as a powerful unifier as music. \n In conclusion, I believe that music has the unique capacity of bringing about social closeness, regardless of individual cultures and ages.","Let me start with the positives of your work. \n Your first reasoning paragraph (2nd paragraph) is highly effective. While the grammar may not be perfect, you were able to convey your meaning, without confusing the reader too much. It also has a degree of coherence to the discussion based on your related topic presentations within the paragraph. However, you should avoid mentioning any reference to researched information. You should always make it clear that the information comes from public perception or a personal opinion in the presentation. Do not be afraid to use the first pronoun presentation format since the prompt mentions the word YOU, that is indicative of first pronoun usage throughout the essay. \n The third paragraph (second reasoning paragraph) is a bit disconnected. There is no way you can connect the Happy Birthday Song with Covid 19. That paragraph comes across as forcing through and not really well developed. You should work on using only related topics per paragraph so further boos your C&C score. \n Now for what you did wrong. \n The paraphrasing is too rushed. You should have used 3-5 sentences in both the introduction and concluding paragraphs. The reason being that both paragraphs require you to properly restate the original prompt and discussion reasons. The difference being that the concluding paraphrase requires you to also present your personal opinion along with your reasoning topics. That would create a proper concluding paragraph for the essay. The way you have it presented now will not meet the requirements for a higher TA score.","The essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, specifically the unique power of music to bridge cultural and generational gaps. However, there are several areas that require improvement for clarity, coherence, and depth.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay successfully addresses the prompt, stating a clear agreement with the opinion that music can unite people from diverse cultures and ages. This position is consistently maintained throughout the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While the essay is mostly well-written, there are minor grammar errors and stylistic choices that could be refined to improve readability and conveyance of ideas. Avoid overly complex sentences, and aim for clear and concise expression. Additionally, ensuring that every piece of information, especially that pertaining to research, is presented as a personal opinion or widely accepted belief would make the arguments more persuasive and fitting to the essay’s subjective nature.

3. **Author’s Point of View**: The essay clearly conveys the author's point of view, with a strong stance in favor of music's unifying power. However, strengthening the personal perspective, especially by using the first person (""I believe,"" ""In my opinion"") more prominently, could enhance the authenticity and engagement of the narrative.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay contains relevant examples to support the idea that music is a universal language capable of uniting people across cultural and generational divides. Nonetheless, the coherence of arguments within paragraphs could be improved. For instance, connecting the Happy Birthday song to COVID-19 pandemic responses might appear unrelated. Focusing on closely related examples within each paragraph would enhance the essay’s overall coherence and argumentative power.

Moreover, the introduction and conclusion need further development. These sections should not only bookend the essay but also succinctly paraphrase the prompt and articulate the main arguments and personal stance. A more elaborated introduction and conclusion, consisting of 3-5 sentences each, would effectively set up and wrap up the discussion, contributing to a higher evaluation score.

In summary, while the essay's core message is compelling and largely well-expressed, focusing on clear, concise language, coherence in argumentation, and a more definitive structure, particularly in the introduction and conclusion, would significantly bolster its effectiveness. Addressing these points will lead to a more powerful and persuasive piece of writing.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

All of above are just examples to show one indisputable fact: movies or TV's influence on our behavior and the influence is not just for a short period. \n In a short time, media can effect on our mood. For instance; when you listen to heartbreaking music all of sudden you feel down while another hour with another type of music you feel cheerful. This fact is also true when you listen or watch the news; some news make you angry, while others make you happy, and the worth thing is we make all our decision base on our mood or in the other word we behave according to information we receive. \n In a long time, Media defines good and what is bad for us. News, programs, TV series always dictate what is right or wrong, how you should dress, or how is the appropriate behavior, and even what you should like or dislike. For example; Fat people are not considered model since all models we see on media are slim. \n Media can influence our behavior in short time and long time. You feel hungry when you are watching cooking channel or feel angry when hearing bad news. These are just examples of the effect of media on our behavior in a short time and how good people should dress or how should behave are examples of media in a long time.

Right now, the essay misses out on creating a relaxed reading atmosphere for your reader. \n By the way, I'd appreciate it if you can share the complete discussion prompt in this thread. I can't really judge the validity of your content and presentation unless I know the parameters by which you were supposed to write your response essay. Right now, I can only offer a general review and commentary, based upon the information that I can judge from reading your work. \n Now, you need to lengthen your paragraph discussions. You should aim to present more information in each paragraph that tries to cover the maximum of 5 sentences . While you present commonly known information in the essay, there are instances when your essay will best be helped by the presentation of your personal experience or connection with the prompt. That will depend upon the instructions provided with the prompt so I am not really sure if that personal opinion or experience is necessary in this instance. At the moment, the information has a generalized feel to the commentary and doesn't really inform the reader about anything not already commonly known. \n Reading the actual prompt will help me to better assess your essay and advice you regarding how to properly approach it. I hope you can post the prompt soon.","Reflecting on the essay provided, several key points emerge that can significantly enhance its effectiveness concerning the given topic. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay briefly addresses the influence of media on behavior over short and long periods, an indication that it aligns with a topic related to media's impact. However, the absence of the exact prompt limits a precise assessment of how well the content matches the required discussion parameters. Enhancing the essay to directly address the specific aspects of the prompt (if known) can refine its relevance and focus.

2. **Structural and Formatting Issues:** It's of utmost importance to structure your essay to improve readability and cohesiveness. Introducing spaces between paragraphs will greatly aid in distinguishing separate points and make the essay more reader-friendly. Each paragraph should ideally focus on a singular main idea, aiding in a clear, organized flow of information.

3. **Content Depth and Paragraph Length:** Aim to expand on the points discussed in each paragraph. A guideline might be to strive for a minimum of five sentences per paragraph, which allows for a comprehensive exploration of each idea. This expansion can provide the reader with a deeper understanding of your argument and the evidence supporting it. Integration of specific examples or personal experiences related to the media's influence can further enrich your essay by offering unique perspectives and a more engaging narrative.

4. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style:** The essay demonstrates a need for improvements in grammar and style. For example, consider revising phrases like ""media can effect on our mood"" to ""media can affect our mood,"" to correct grammar and ensure clarity. Paying close attention to spelling, subject-verb agreement, and avoiding the use of fragmented or run-on sentences can also enhance the essay's overall quality.

5. **Clarity of Point of View and Arguments:** While the essay introduces the author's viewpoint that media influences behavior in both the short and long term, it would benefit from clearer and more descriptive arguments to support this position. Elaborating on specific examples, such as the influence of media on body image perceptions, can offer concrete evidence that enriches your argument.

6. **Consider Addition of Personal Touch:** The inclusion of personal experiences or reflections, if aligned with the essay instructions, can offer a compelling dimension to the essay. It not only personalizes your response but can also provide a tangible connection between the theoretical discussion of media's influence and its real-world impact.

In sum, focusing on improving formatting, deepening content with detailed examples or personal insights, refining grammar and style, and reinforcing clear arguments will collectively enhance the quality of the essay. These adjustments will not only make the essay more engaging but also more informative, offering readers a well-rounded exploration of media's pervasive influence on behavior.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4807,https://essayforum.com/writing/countries-young-people-encouraged-89548/,dev,"[IELTS WRITING TASK 2] In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year","It is a promoted idea for youngers to take a gap year upon highschool graduation before entering university in some countries, which has both pros and cons that require careful evaluation before drawing a conclusion. \n An evident advantage to having a break is that they can develop social skills including communication and problem-solving, which are beneficial for further education as well as their career later on. By working or traveling, young people are exposed to real life scenerios, allowing them to respond creatively on the spot. For example, while traveling, they might have to talk to strangers if they get lost, or learn how to survive a night in the cold weather with little to no food. These personal experiences will help them gain better understanding of themselves regarding strengths and weaknesses to determine what they want to major in if they decide to go to a university. Another strong point is that it helps saving time and resources. Once they are aware of their choices, one might opt for vocational school to attain a certificate to do the job they want with less time and money. \n In spite of the mentioned benefits, one might argue that the time might be a waste if they do not get a professional intellectual job or if the trips are luxurious ones with little opportunity to sharpen their life skills. While it is a valid concern, it might be the case for a small number of young people with financial privileges, and even then, the skills learned from personal experiences are unique and cannot simply be measured by a brief observation. \n Overall, it is apparent that the pros of taking a gap year before attending university outweigh the cons in a number of different ways. I am of the opinion that young people should be encouraged to do so.","This is an unnecessarily long essay that fails to deliver on 2 specific points: \n - A proper word count of 250-290 words within 40 minutes \n - Properly developed and clear topic developments in each paragraph \n In the prompt restatement, you changed the discussion instructions by indicating that you will be providing a conclusion / opinion in the essay. That is a prompt deviation which will immediately lower your task accuracy score because the original instruction was to only discuss the advantage and disadvantage, nowhere in the original presentation were you asked to present your own opinion or come to a conclusion about the discussion. You will receive point deductions and word count deductions for references to this incorrect discussion prompt. \n In the Advantage reasoning paragraph. The first idea is well represented and explained. It would have helped you get a high C&C score if you had not added the incompletely discussed second reasoning. You were asked to present only one advantage in the prompt, the second one is a throw away. That is why it became under developed. You are not scored on the amount of information you know. The score comes from the clarity of the information that you know, even if it is only based on one representative topic. \n Your disadvantages discussion is also composed of little developed ideas in the presentation. You are only presenting reasons, but failing to explain them in a convincing manner. So the first 2 sentences had potential, then you failed to build on it. The next presentation did not even relate to the first discussion point so that only confused the reader, causing a lower C&C score for this presentation.","The essay provides a nuanced discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of taking a gap year after high school, touching upon the development of social skills and the financial aspects of making such a decision. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay deviates from the instructions by presenting a personal opinion and conclusion, which was not requested in the initial prompt. Sticking closely to the given instructions is crucial. Specifically, the essay should focus solely on discussing the advantages and disadvantages of a gap year as per the original prompt, without introducing an independent conclusion or opinion. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling or grammatical errors, but overall, the essay is well-written. However, attention should be paid to maintaining a clear and concise style. For instance, using simpler language can make the arguments more accessible to all readers, especially when explaining complex ideas.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay introduces the author’s point of view by suggesting that the benefits of a gap year outweigh its drawbacks. Although sharing an opinion is valuable, it's important to remember to adhere to the essay prompt's requirements, which did not ask for a personal viewpoint. 

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay successfully describes an advantage of taking a gap year by highlighting the development of crucial life skills through real-world experiences. However, discussing multiple advantages without fully exploring each can dilute the overall argument. It’s better to focus on one advantage and explore it thoroughly. On the disadvantages side, the ideas introduced need further development and clearer connections to each other to strengthen the argument and avoid confusing the reader.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- Refocus the essay to align strictly with the prompt's requirements by discussing the advantages and disadvantages equally without introducing personal opinions or conclusions.
- Choose one advantage and one disadvantage of taking a gap year to discuss in detail for a more concentrated and thorough exploration of the topic.
- Simplify language for clarity and accessibility, ensuring the essay is easy to understand for readers with varying levels of English proficiency.
- Work on developing arguments fully by providing more examples and elaborating on how each point directly impacts the decision to take a gap year.

Applying these changes will help create a more focused, instructive, and compelling argument that adheres closely to the assignment's guidelines.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

It lowers life quality in urban areas and raises crime rate. The essay below attempts to elaborate on the drawbacks of urbanisation and proposes some resolutions to it. \n Cities are highly vulnerable under the effect of urbanisation. More than often, this phenomena creates overcrowding and lack of sanitation, leading to diseases outbreak. At the same time, urbanisation potentially triggers the shortage in utilities in utilities, such as water, electricity and sewage disposal. Another down side of this problem is the constantly rising crime rates. Unfortunately, a high proportion of immigrants into urban areas are forced to reside in slums, which are not owned by them. Meanwhile, slums are widely regarded as the breeding ground for criminal activities. Maintenance of law and order, therefore, becomes more difficult. \n To achieve the goal of sustainable development, the government needs to put the crisis of urbanisation on its agenda and come up with practical resolutions. To combat the lack of utilities, those with higher power should create more private and public partnerships and provide waste; water and housing disposal for residents. At the same time, they should also enforce the widespread of education so that it can reach even slum residents. With proper training and housing development, both life quality and order maintenance shall be heightened. \n In conclusion, urbanisation is definitely not something for society to overlook, and it generally takes elaborative steps to approach its disadvantages.","There are two problem areas in your essay. The prompt paraphrase is incorrect and the second paragraph does not clearly explain itself. Hence, these will be the two areas that my review will focus on. \n In your paraphrase, you did not include a paraphrase of the sentence topic in the essay which is "" These days, people from urban areas come to the city to look for a better life. "" Without the paraphrase of that sentence, the presentation you used took on an alternative discussion slant to a small degree. The rest of your paraphrase is alright and stays within the remaining paraphrase requirements. So the first sentence should have been included by kicking off your paraphrase with the following: \n <em>The promise of a better life has enticed residents of metropolitan areas to move to intraurban locations...</em> \n Keep your paragraphs within 5 sentences. Do not try to discuss too many topics in your paragraphs so that what happens is that you just keep giving reasons, without adding supporting examples to justify your claims. It is more important to present 2 justified claims than 3 mentioned reasons. You will score better in the C&C section if you better explain your reasons by using proper sentence transitions within the 5 sentence maximum. You need only 2 related reasons in one paragraph which is connected by the transition sentence. For example you could have said: \n <em>... The results of these problems can be seen in the rise in urban crime rate.</em> Then you could have proceeded to mention the crime problem. \n The second body paragraphs lack subjects in the way the sentence is presented. The possible solution is presented, but the reason why suggestions such as these will work is not there. Therefore, the essay does not contain a clear discussion. \n The conclusion is only a single sentence, It does not follow the minimum 3 sentence requirement. That happened because you did not do the reverse paraphrase as required by these Task 2 essays. Next time, increase the sentences in the conclusion so that you can also raise your word count in relation to the scoring criteria.","This essay addresses urbanisation and its impacts, offering solutions, which aligns with the requested topic. However, it seems there was a misunderstanding of the original prompt, which mentioned that people move to the city for a better life. Incorporating this into the introduction would strengthen its relevance to the original topic. For example, starting with ""The promise of a better life has enticed residents of metropolitan areas to move to cities...""

Regarding structure and clarity, the essay would benefit from a more organized approach. Each paragraph should not exceed five sentences, focusing on delivering clear and supported arguments rather than an accumulation of reasons without detailed explanations. Aim to present two well-justified claims per paragraph, connected by coherent transitions. This will not only enhance the readability but also ensure a stronger demonstration of critical thinking and analysis.

The essay occasionally struggles with spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For instance, ""phenomena"" (plural) is used instead of ""phenomenon"" (singular), and the essay sometimes repeats phrases such as ""in utilities."" Paying close attention to grammar and ensuring variety in sentence structure can significantly improve the overall flow and professionalism of the writing.

The solutions to urbanisation are briefly touched upon but lack detailed explanation regarding their effectiveness or feasibility. Expanding on why certain solutions could work, possibly with examples or data, would provide a stronger argument and a more persuasive essay. Additionally, the use of more specific subjects in sentences can clarify your points.

Lastly, the conclusion is too brief and would benefit from expansion. A robust conclusion should summarize key points and restate the essay's main argument, reinforcing the discussion’s significance. Aim for at least three sentences to ensure a complete and satisfying closure to your essay.

In summary, focusing on a clearer structure, providing well-supported arguments, refining grammar and style, and expanding the conclusion will greatly enhance the essay's effectiveness.

Additionally, it is able to help businesses approach maximum potential customers. As a result, businesses can leverage this to organize fascinating competitions to enhance their transaction conversion rate.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some issues with sentence structure that need attention.

Also, be cautious of repetitive phrases and try to vary your language to maintain the reader's interest. Remember, clarity and conciseness are key in effective writing.

However, the essay could benefit from clearer and more direct statements of your position in the introduction and conclusion. This not only reinforces your stance but also helps guide the reader through your arguments.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you offer some examples to support your position, there's a need for more specific and relevant evidence to strengthen your argument.

As the result, the question of whether spending a great deal of money on festivals is necessary remains highly controversial. From my perspective, maintaining the quality of the festivals is important. \n It is clear that there are more urgent issues that should be tackled. For example, reinforcing infrastructure in most of the countries in the world is crucial. Besides, many schools over the world are now undergoing a terrible education system and need solving immediately. Sometimes, revenue cannot justify the cost. Countries should also exchange their cultures with others to create a multicultural society and enrich their relationships with other nations.

People always find out a way to assist them in escaping from dull life. Should the government resolve it, the conflicts among residents will arise.

The question being asked is whether you agree or disagree that people and the local governments are spending too much money on festivals. It is basically a yes or no question \n Question: Do you agree or disagree? \n Response: From my perspective, maintaining the quality of the festivals is important. \n With that mistake, you failed the task accuracy portion of the test. Which then hinders the possibility of you scoring at least a 5 with this essay. You are not responding to the task requirement with your response because rather than saying whether you agree or disagree, you changed the instruction and chose to respond to a topic of your choosing instead. Such a prompt deviation creates complications with how the rest of your writing will be received by the examiner. \n The proper approach to this essay would have been to say ""I agree with this statement for a number of reasons"" and then you can use 2 paragraphs to defend your stand. This is not an extent essay so you cannot ""partially"" agree or disagree with the statement. This is a one point of view response essay instead. I suggest you familiarize yourself with how those were written in order to learn from those who previously took and passed the test.","The essay does not directly address the question posed by the topic, which asks if you agree or disagree that too much money is being spent on national holidays. The response focuses on the importance of maintaining the quality of festivals, which is a different subject. This failure to directly answer the question affects the relevance of your essay to the task at hand. It's important for future essays to carefully read and directly respond to the question asked.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay could benefit from closer attention to these aspects. There are instances of awkward phrasing and potential errors that could disrupt the flow and clarity of your message. For example, consider revising phrases like ""burgeoning increase"" to more precise and appropriate language. Ensuring proper grammar and stylistic coherence will significantly improve the readability of your essay.

The point of view in the essay is somewhat clear; you appear to believe that the preservation and celebration of tradition through festivals are important. However, because the essay does not directly respond to the prompt, this point of view is less relevant to the discussion than it might otherwise be. Make sure your viewpoint directly relates to the prompt for a more focused and compelling argument.

In terms of arguments to support your position, there are some descriptive elements present, such as discussing the benefits to tourism in Vietnam. However, since the essay does not directly answer the original question, these arguments are not as effective as they might be. When making an argument, it's crucial to ensure it directly supports your answer to the question asked. For a prompt that asks for a specific agreement or disagreement, structure your argument around clear reasons supporting that stance, without diverting into unrelated topics.

For future essays, ensure to directly address the question, maintain clarity and cohesiveness in your arguments, and check for any grammatical or stylistic errors. This will greatly enhance the effectiveness of your writing and better meet the expectations of English proficiency tests.",3,3,3,2,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4812,https://essayforum.com/writing/video-platforms-agree-94165/,dev,Video Platforms - IELTS WRITING TASK 2 - AGREE OR DISAGREE?,"Some people are of the opinion that video platforms provide a greater means to impart knowledge on how people live in many places than texts. From my point of view, although I agree that videos can create a more engaging learning experience, I believe written documents could compensate for certain setbacks of their counterparts. \n On the one hand, learners could become more engaged in their areas of interest by the use of video materials. This is because videos offer viewers both visual and auditory inputs rather than solely abstract ideas delivered via texts. These stimulants not only describe the objects in the most authentic way but also make it easier for learners to visualise and retain information. For example, a video about a local festival would be far more effective than a written dissertation on the said subject in a sense that the former provides viewers with information about the music, the costumes, or the customs in a readily-acceptable fashion. \n On the other hand, written records could emerge as a more convenient source in certain cases. Firstly, documents could save more time when learners need to conduct research on complex subjects. For instance, the economic developments of a country could better be encapsulated in a written analysis, since it deals with various abstract concepts. Researchers, in this case, would find it easier to read and use this later for reference. Secondly, videos are not always available due to their huge production effort. Obviously, when compared to this hard work, written records require much less, thus become more easily accessible. \n In conclusion, videos could better enhance the learning experience as it helps visualising what life is in its nature. However, written documents make a better choice when it comes to complex and costly areas of studies.","This is an extent essay so an emotional response is required or a reference to an unmeasured (dis)agreement. It is not enough to say ""although I..."" because it does not indicate the reponse format as indicated by the writing instruction. The format would have been more task adherent had to you responded with ""I do not fully agree with the statement because there comes a point where written text is needed to fill in certain information."" The phrase ""do not fully agree"" is the response to question ""To what extent?"" The measure is there. You are not in full agreement. Proper response formatting will help increase the task accuracy score. Ensure that the correct reference and keywords are used in that section. \n While the response paragraphs are correct in number, the basis for the explanations are not all valid for scoring. The examiner will only award points to the discussion that supports your opinion. This will be seen as response that lacks correct opinion support. How do you accomplish that? \n Remember that you said you are not in full agreement? Well, when you discuss the explanation, use the reasons that you feel you can successfully prove as faulty. The format will be: \n Sentence 1: Positive reason for videos \n Sentence 2: Basis for positive reaction from the public \n Sentence 3: Oppose that opinion by showing its limitation \n Sentence 4: Explain your opposition \n Sentence 5: Give an example to support your opinion \n By doing so, you will show why you are not in full agreement with the public belief. It is a case of not saying the other side is wrong, just that their belief has loopholes that can show the faults in their opinion. This is one prompt that requires a debate response format. \n Your work is actually acceptable and will receive scoring points. It just won't be full scoring points because of the aforementioned reasons. This is not a bad first try. I can see your potential to score well in all aspects of writing. Your thoughts are clear and well reasoned.

However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the argument.

**1. Response to the Topic:**
The essay indeed addresses the topic, examining the merits of video materials versus written documents in learning. However, the response could be strengthened by directly addressing the extent to which the author agrees or disagrees with the given statement. Instead of simply stating agreement or disagreement, elaborating on the conditions or specific contexts in which one form may be preferred over the other could provide a clearer stance. For example, indicating that videos are beneficial up to a certain point beyond which texts become essential could offer a nuanced perspective.

**2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
The essay is generally well-written and follows a logical structure. Nonetheless, paying closer attention to the variety of sentence structures could improve readability and engagement. Employing a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences would not only make the writing more dynamic but also showcase a higher level of English proficiency.

**3. Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
While the essay presents a balanced view, there's room to more explicitly state the personal stance regarding the effectiveness of videos versus texts. For heightened clarity, consider beginning with a more defined thesis statement that precisely outlines your perspective. This approach ensures that readers understand the lens through which the subsequent arguments are presented.

**4. Supporting Arguments:**
The essay features examples and reasoning that support both sides of the argument. To further strengthen these arguments, consider following a structured format within the body paragraphs. Begin with acknowledging the positive aspects of videos, followed by a critical examination of their limitations, and culminating with a supporting example that illustrates why texts can be superior in certain contexts. This structured debate format not only aids in firmly establishing your position but also demonstrates critical thinking and analytical skills.

Lastly, while the essay effectively examines the merits of both videos and texts, remembering to continuously tie back each point to the central thesis will make for a more cohesive and persuasive argument. Emphasizing how each argument supports the overarching stance will improve the logical flow and persuasiveness of the essay.

In summary, the essay is on the right track with a solid foundation and clear thought process. Focusing on directly addressing the prompt, enhancing sentence variety, clearly stating the personal perspective, and structuring the arguments more strategically will undoubtedly elevate the quality of the essay. With these improvements, the essay has the potential to not only meet but exceed English proficiency test expectations.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Who should take a charge of it?,"Some people think environmental problems are too big for individuals to solve. Others, however, think that those problems can not be solved unless individuals take some action.

It is argued that these problems are so complex that individuals couldn't handle it. While some think that as long as people take actions, environmental problems could be solved. The two statements will be discussed in the essay below and person opinion will be given as well. \n Environmental problems such as global warming have been commonly regarded as a complicated issue for its wide range of aspects involved. It could be a discussion about science, pollution, animal extinction, and even human lifestyles. To provide a complete solution, government policies and professions from different fields are necessary, which is also the reason why there are multiple statements for a particular environmental problem. Most people do not have the professional knowledge to discuss certain issues deeply. \n Some argue that there are still things for individuals could do to solve environmental problems because the main reason for these problems is usually human. As long as people change their attitude to our mother earth, take actions to protect our home, problems may gradually retard. For instance, travel by public transportation instead of a private vehicle. Little changes by people may accumulate and heal the earth. \n In my opinion, I support the statement about the necessity for humans taking actions to prevent environmental problems. Not only can we change our lifestyles by doing recycles but also by attending volunteers to clean beaches. To know more about environmental issues, individuals could learn related knowledge through the internet and discuss with others. By exchanging opinions, it may gain much more attention to these significant problems. \n To sum up, professions and government policy are required for a complete solution to environmental problems. However, it is also vital for individuals to pay close attention and take specific actions to benefit the environment.

This time, I want you to practice using transition sentences at the end of every reasoning paragraph to help introduce the next discussion topic with more clarity. The aim is to further improve your GRA as well as C&C scoring potential.","The essay successfully addresses the topic by exploring different perspectives on whether environmental problems can be solved by individuals or require collective actions and government intervention. The opening paragraph effectively sets the stage for this discussion, demonstrating an understanding of the essay prompt. This clear introduction helps outline the structure of the essay, facilitating a cohesive flow of ideas.

In terms of content, the essay presents a balanced view by discussing the complexity of environmental issues and the role of individual actions in addressing these problems. The argument that environmental challenges are multi-faceted and require government and professional intervention is well-stated. Similarly, the case for individual responsibility through lifestyle changes and participation in environmental initiatives is compellingly made. These sections show a grasp of the subject matter and provide a solid foundation for the author's opinion.

However, there are areas where the essay could be strengthened. First, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother. Incorporating transition sentences at the end of paragraphs can make the essay more coherent and guide readers more effectively from one idea to the next. Such transitions will enhance the overall flow of the essay and make the argumentation more persuasive.

Second, while the essay's grammar and vocabulary are generally adequate, there is room for improvement to elevate the writing. Attention to grammatical details and the use of a more varied vocabulary can enhance clarity and readability. Also, ensuring that all ideas and arguments are fully developed with supporting details can provide a more robust discussion. For example, when mentioning specific actions individuals can take, expanding on how these actions contribute to broader environmental solutions could make the argument more compelling.

Finally, the essay's conclusion succinctly summarizes the main points and reiterates the author's stance, effectively closing the discussion. However, emphasizing the feasibility and impact of combined efforts—both individual and governmental—could provide a more powerful closing statement. The conclusion offers an opportunity to highlight the importance of everyone's contribution to solving environmental issues, reinforcing the essay's message.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a thoughtful discussion. With improved transitions, enhanced grammar and vocabulary, and more developed arguments, the writing can achieve greater coherence, clarity, and persuasiveness.

They are all crucial factors since they inform who I am, guide my choices and contribute to my unique journey.",There are several problems with your paragraph presentation. The first problem I saw was in the way that you tend to misspell words such as elaborately and identity. You obviously did not spellcheck your work before submitting it for review. You should practice conscious editing as you write your paragraphs so that you can avoid simple errors such as spelling problems. \n Grammar problems also exist in the essay. You need to familiarize yourself with the times when a possessive word presentation should be used. It is not always necessary to do so. Your sentences should be kept simple. You need to practice more and really update your grammar rules knowledge. Problems with preposition usage is very obvious in your presentations. Noun references in the singular or plural form should also be clearly addressed in your sentence building lessons.,"Your essay on the different aspects of identity—given, chosen, and core—is thoughtful and provides a personal insight into how these identities impact life. First, let’s celebrate your strengths: you’ve selected a compelling topic and have clearly put thought into how different kinds of identity shape us. You shared specific examples, like Tet holiday celebrations, that bring your given identity to life in a vivid way. This helps readers understand your points more deeply.

However, to make your essay even more effective, consider the following advice:

1. **Response to Topic**: You've done an excellent job in responding to the topic. Each paragraph focuses on a different aspect of identity, which keeps your essay organized and on-point. To enhance this further, you might consider briefly mentioning how each identity type impacts you at the beginning of each paragraph as a guide for your reader.

2. **Spelling and Grammar Issues**: There are some spelling mistakes (e.g., ""elobrately"" should be ""elaborately"", ""idetity"" should be ""identity"") that could be corrected with a spell checker. While minor, these errors can distract readers from your message. Grammar also needs attention; for instance, when constructing possessive forms or choosing between singular and plural nouns, make sure the form matches the noun it refers to. Furthermore, watch out for preposition usage. These are small but crucial details that improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Clear Point of View**: Your point of view comes through, especially in discussing how each aspect of identity influences you. To make it even clearer, you could explicitly state your main point or thesis at the beginning and summarize it at the end, creating a strong, clear frame for your essay.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments are nicely outlined but could be more vividly described and detailed. For example, when discussing chosen identity, mentioning specific decisions and how they have shaped your life would strengthen your argument. Additionally, connecting how each type of identity influences each other more clearly could enhance the complexity and depth of your essay.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Use spell check and read your essay out loud to catch spelling and grammar mistakes.
- Practice simple sentence construction to avoid complex grammatical errors.
- Increase specificity in your arguments with more detailed examples.
- Clarify the connections between different aspects of identity to make your thesis stronger and more nuanced.

It helps us to find the potential beauty, even in the most terrible thing. There are a number of things or people that we normally never pay any attention to, but for the help of art, all of them are carved in a brilliant way, therefore, it makes us all realize that each person or each thing has its own pulchritude. The short Vietnamese story ""Chi Pheo"", which is written by Nam Cao, illustrates that even the worst person (Chi Pheo) is also able to become kind if we show respect to him.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are occasional grammatical errors and awkward sentences that could be simplified for better clarity.

4. **Support for the Author's Position:** You provided interesting examples, like the Vietnamese story ""Chi Pheo"" and a case in Japan, to illustrate art's power.

Instead of mentioning various forms of art broadly, choose one or two specific forms (e.g., literature, visual arts) and delve deeper into how these specifically offer insights that science cannot. This will make your argument more targeted and compelling.

Additionally, to further strengthen your essay, consider discussing the emotional and psychological impact of art on individuals and communities.

Good work!,"The essay addresses the topic by describing the changes on a small offshore island, reflecting an understanding of the task. However, there are a few key areas where improvement is needed to enhance the clarity, objectiveness, and overall effectiveness of the writing.

Firstly, it's essential not to refer to visual elements like ""the two maps below"" since the essay should stand alone without the need for images. Descriptions and analyses should be clear and understandable without the reader having to see any pictures or diagrams. Instead of directing the reader to look at maps, describe the changes and features directly.

The usage of the word ""perhaps"" introduces an element of personal assumption, which is not appropriate for this type of analytical writing. Instead of speculating, focus on presenting clear, factual information about the changes on the island. Your writing should aim to be objective and based on the information provided rather than personal interpretations or assumptions.

On a positive note, the concluding statement effectively summarizes the transformations the island has undergone, which demonstrates an ability to synthesize information. This is a strong point of the essay as it wraps up the descriptions into a coherent overview of the island's development.

For spelling, grammar, and stylistic suggestions: 
- Pay attention to tense consistency. The essay mostly uses the past tense to discuss changes, which is appropriate, but ensure this is applied consistently throughout.
- Avoid repetitive phrases and consider varying your sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. 
- Words like ""uninhibited"" might be a misuse where ""uninhabited"" is intended. Such missteps can hinder clear understanding.

To clarify the author's point of view, while maintaining the analytical nature of the essay, ensure all descriptions and summaries are based on observable changes rather than personal viewpoints. Providing specific examples of changes, such as the construction of facilities, supports your point but remember to keep the discussion fact-based.

In terms of arguments and supporting evidence, the description of developments like the construction of a reception, restaurant, and residential areas are well-noted. Enhancing these descriptions with more detail and possibly discussing the impact of these changes could further strengthen the essay. For instance, explaining how the new facilities cater to tourists or affect the island's atmosphere could provide a deeper analysis.

Overall, this essay shows a good effort to describe significant changes on the island, effectively summarizing the transformation in the conclusion. Focusing on objective analysis, avoiding assumptions, and improving clarity and grammar will make future essays even stronger.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Descriptive

What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words. \n MY ESSAY: \n These days, more and more people have a propensity to be self-employed instead of being employees of any corporations or organizations. There are several possible reasons for this case and we cannot deny some certain drawbacks of this development. \n To commence with, there have been a number of reasons for people choosing to have their own business. Firstly, people nowadays are getting more and more initiative, thus they do not want to be followers but leaders. Since being self-employed can give these individuals chances to take the initiative, they opt for building up their businesses and becoming owners. Take the example of my uncle, after having been turned down several times for a position in a company that he applied to, he went for building up a company of his own and his enterprise made a great success. Second, many people especially the young would prefer to challenge themselves by becoming freelancers in many facets of work. It is undeniable young persons could possibly perform their best potential when being independent in their work. \n Nevertheless, this trend could bring people unexpected disadvantages. To begin with, if one does not have enough necessary to be self-employed and keeps moving on with this path, they could be more prone to failure. Some latest published research has shown that a high rate of young people's own businesses went bankrupt due to lack of experience. Additionally, in order to be self-employed, one needs to have a stable financial basement in advance, thus people need to be well-prepared for this decision, which requires a lot of time. \n In conclusion, the tendency to be initiative and to experience challenges in work prompt people to be self-employed. However, this development can bring people some drawbacks about unwanted failure and expose them to the financial burden. \n (299 words)","The writer has a bad habit of over extending his paragraphs by regularly using sentence fillers for the first part of his paragraph presentation.

The latter causing deductions in the C+C score of the paragraph.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are minor issues with sentence structure and word choice. For instance, consider simplifying phrases like ""have a propensity to"" to ""prefer."" This makes the essay more accessible. Watch out for repeating words and try to vary your language. Additionally, ensure your paragraphs flow smoothly by connecting ideas more clearly.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view is generally clear but could be strengthened by explicitly summarizing your main arguments in the introductory paragraph. This sets the stage for the reader and provides a roadmap of what to expect.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your essay introduces valuable points, but these need deeper exploration. Avoid starting paragraphs with unnecessary fillers. Jump straight into your argument to ensure every sentence adds value. Focus on developing your ideas fully. For example, when mentioning the risks of self-employment, delve deeper into why lack of experience is critical, perhaps by giving clearer, more specific examples or statistics.

To enhance your essay:

- Avoid lengthy introductions to your paragraphs. Get straight to the point to make the most of your words and effectively develop your ideas.
- Integrate a brief summary of your main points in your introduction to guide your readers from the start.
- Ensure your second reasoning or example in each paragraph is as fully developed and coherent as the first. This will strengthen the overall argument you're making.

4818,https://essayforum.com/writing/compulsory-tax-payment-agree-89993/,dev,IELTS task 2: COMPULSORY TAX PAYMENT (agree or disagree),"Over the recent years, tax payment has become a major concern worldwide. While it is compulsory for adult inhabitants to contribute money to state revenue, varying people argue it should not be their duty. In my opinion, it is reasonable for governments to levy on workers' income and business profits. \n Without a doubt, paying taxes plays a vital role in maintaining and improving social conditions. To be specific, most communal goods and services, such as parks, schools and hospitals are funded by public money. Besides, without tax, important departments, for instance, national defense and police would not be functional, which harms not only the security but also the world peace. On the other hand, governments are considered untrustworthy due to corruption and political instability, however, it is inevitable that tax payment significantly influences the community if state issues are worked out well. \n Equally important, solving the inequality gap can be viewed as a primary reason why governments should levy mature citizens and companies. In the modern world, income tax would undoubtedly help balance the power between different social classes as the rich have to pay much more money to state revenue than the poor. Furthermore, public money financially supports the poverty, the homeless and the unemployed besides providing governmental pension payments for retired employees. Although varied people would argue imposing tax may shortly weaken the economy due to huge charges on the rich, other social classes would be benefited and motivated to contribute more in addition to dealing with the inequality effectively. \n In conclusion, I strongly agree that it is essential for every mature adult to pay tax to the state instead of saving all the money they earn in order to improve public conditions as well as tackling wealth inequality. It is also recommended that varied major issues about politics and corruption should be eliminated so that tax can play a more major part in developing society.","<quotation>it is reasonable for governments</quotation> \n So you totally agree?

The essay speaks of taxes on national and local levels. There are no global taxes on individuals that would affect world peace. You could refer to national or community peace instead.","Your essay on the topic of taxation and its importance in society is a thoughtful piece that presents several compelling arguments in favor of taxation. Here are some specific points of feedback to help improve your essay further:

1. Response to the Topic: Your essay directly addresses the assigned topic by discussing the necessity and benefits of taxes for societal welfare and reducing income inequality. However, it would enhance your essay if you explicitly state your position (strong agreement with the necessity of taxation) at the beginning. This sets a clear tone for your argument right from the start.

2. Spelling, Grammar, and Style: Your essay is well-written with few spelling or grammatical errors, making your arguments easy to follow. To improve stylistically, consider varying your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. Additionally, be mindful of using phrases that match the scale of your argument. For example, referring to ""world peace"" may overstate the impact of national or local taxation; consider specifying ""national security"" or ""community safety"" instead.

3. Clarity of Point of View: Your point of view is clear and consistent throughout the essay. Strengthening this further, as mentioned earlier, involves stating your strong agreement with the essay prompt at the beginning to guide the reader through your argumentation.

4. Descriptive Arguments: Your essay successfully uses descriptive arguments to support your view, especially when discussing the role of taxes in funding public services and addressing income inequality. To enhance your arguments further, consider providing more specific examples or data to back up your claims. This could involve citing statistics on how taxes contribute to public goods or examples of countries where tax strategies have successfully addressed inequality.

5. Addressing Counterarguments: You briefly mention the perspective of those who oppose taxation, mainly focusing on concerns about government corruption and economic impact. To strengthen your essay, you could expand on these counterarguments more thoroughly and then refute them with concrete evidence or reasoning. This would not only show a well-rounded understanding of the issue but also reinforce your own position.

By addressing these points, your essay will offer a clearer, more engaging, and well-supported argument on the importance of taxation for societal welfare and equality.

4819,https://essayforum.com/writing/cbest-technology-part-modern-life-86135/,dev,CBEST Writing Technology is very much a part of modern life. Many people see technology as a force,"Technology has become a big part in our daily life. We can see technology everywhere around us. However, there are always arguments on whether technology is positive or negative to the society. People think technology is negative because it could be distracting, for example, people are looking at their phones every day in their life. On the other hand, people with positive opinions upon technology think technology is great because of the improvements it brings to us. In my opinion, I think the contribution of technology has made to modern life has been more positive. With technology, education, work and daily life have all become easier and more convenient to us. \n Technology made education more accessible. Nowadays, there are plenty of online educational resources that people could access from anywhere in the world. The online education benefits people who could not be in the classroom in person for reasons. For example, some colleges offer online degree which all lessons will be taught through the online platform. In this way, people don't have to come to the university in order to get the education, which greatly reduce the costs of college. Thus, education is more convenient and more accessible to people because of the technology. \n Technology brings flexibility and mobility to our work. Nowadays, people don't have to come to their office to get their work done especially those people in the tech field. People's work becomes more flexible because of the use of technology. Some people wasted a long time on transportation could now spend extra time at their home working on projects with the help of remote work technology system, such as employee portal and Zoom for online conferences. \n Life becomes more convenience with technology. Technology allows people to have a lighter and more convenient life. For example, as we notice that in some countries, especially in China, people don't have to bring their wallets when they go out for shopping, and everything they need is their phone. They could simply scan their QR code for checkout at the counter. In addition, people don't have to bring a lot of paper records to the doctors because every record can be accessed online. In general, technology makes our life easier because we don't have to worry about paper records since everything can be stored online nowadays. \n In conclusion, technology has more positive impacts on education, work and life. Without technology, we might find it difficult to access information and perform necessary activities efficiently. I think as the technology is improving, our life will become more and more convenient over time.","You forgot to upload the prompt for this essay along with your written work.

You can always write another essay, upload the prompt with the essay, and receive a complete review from me then. \n Like most essay writers, you decided to take a casual tone to your presentation. You decided to use conjunctions in your presentation. As a future educator, you should know that using conjunctions is a big no-no in academic writing. It is never don't, it is ""do not"".

However, without the original question or prompt, it's challenging to fully assess how well your argument aligns with the specific requirements.

One of the strengths of your essay is its structure. You introduce your viewpoint, develop it with supporting arguments across three paragraphs focusing on education, work, and life in general, then conclude by reiterating your main point. This organization helps make your essay easy to follow.

Despite these strengths, there are several areas where your essay could be improved:

1. **Academic Tone and Style:** Your essay occasionally slips into a more casual tone, evidenced by the use of contractions (e.g., ""don't"" instead of ""do not""). In formal academic writing, it's recommended to avoid contractions to maintain a formal tone. 

2. **Grammar and Precision:** There are a few grammatical errors and areas where precision could be enhanced. For instance, when discussing online degrees, the phrase should be ""online degrees where all lessons..."" to maintain consistency with the plural noun ""colleges"" and to correctly indicate the location of the lessons. Additionally, ""come to the university"" should be ""go to the university"" to correctly reflect the action from the students’ perspective.

3. **Clarity and Coherency:** While your essay is generally well-organized, some sentences could be made clearer. Ensuring each sentence directly supports your argument will strengthen your essay. For example, when discussing the convenience of technology in daily life, providing more varied examples or explaining how technology reduces the need for physical items like wallets and paper records in more depth could add to your argument's clarity.

4. **Detail and Support:** Your examples are relevant, but expanding on them could make your arguments more persuasive. For every point made, consider adding more detailed examples or evidence. This depth can help illustrate your points more vividly for the reader.

In terms of spelling and stylistic issues, while there are no major spelling mistakes, paying attention to the use of singular and plural forms, as well as the correct prepositions, will improve the overall readability and professionalism of your essay.

In future essays, remember to include the essay prompt. This allows for more targeted feedback and ensures your essay meets the specific requirements of the question.

Overall, you've demonstrated a good grasp of the essay's theme and structured your arguments well. By refining your academic writing style, addressing grammatical issues, and adding more detailed support for your arguments, you can further strengthen your essays. Keep these points in mind for your next essay, and continue to develop your ideas as clearly and precisely as possible.

While others think that the authorities ought to limit individual salaries at a certain level. In my opinion, put a law to monthly income is necessary and the governments should enact the law to solve this problem. \n On the one hand, the main reason why some people have a maximum wage law is those are highly skilled or talented. They should be rewarded to high salaries and it is also incentive for others work harder. Some occupations are believed dangerous or unplesant, so high salaries is a sign of country's wealth. High salaries could deter skilled or talented employees from leaving a country. \n Despite the above arguements, the governments should ensure that wealths is evenly distributed throughout a country. It is believed that limiting high wages would bring more equality, especially reduce the pay gap between highest and lowest income, which can be dishearting for some to have a low-paid job, while others receive a high salary. The more important is capping high salaries will prevent rich people from corrupt or unfair control over a certain aspects of society. \n In conclusion, in spite of the dispute for a maximum wage cap, I believe governments should set a limit on the wages of highest earners as it would have positive impacts on whole economic and country.","<quotation>In many countries all around the world</quotation> \n This is a redundant reference.

Specially since the opinion response does not answer the discussion gquestion. It does not ask if a law is needed . It asks if a cap should be placed on salaries. 2 different questions with only the latter needing a response in this presentation. The essay presentation is not related to the orginal presentation.","The provided essay addresses a significant and debated topic: whether it's beneficial for a country to have extremely high incomes or if there should be a cap on individual salaries. Your essay neatly presents arguments for both viewpoints, concluding with a personal stance advocating for a salary cap enforced by the government. This approach towards balanced argumentation is commendable. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the clarity, coherence, and impact of the essay.

Firstly, the introduction of the essay uses the phrase ""In many countries all around the world,"" which is somewhat redundant. Simplifying this to ""In many countries,"" followed by a comma, would make the sentence cleaner and more direct. Regarding the clarity of your opinion statement, it's essential to specify what kind of law you're referring to when discussing the imposition of salary caps. Instead of saying ""put a law to monthly income is necessary,"" it might be more effective to phrase it as ""implementing a law to cap monthly incomes is necessary,"" which directly addresses the topic while providing a clearer view of your stance.

The essay sometimes suffers from unclear language and grammatical issues that need addressing. For instance, the use of ""high salaries is a sign of country's wealth"" can be corrected to ""high salaries are a sign of a country's wealth,"" ensuring agreement in number and the inclusion of the article ""a"" for correctness and clarity. Paying close attention to such details can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of your writing.

Your arguments are presented in a manner that lacks specificity at times. When discussing the benefits and drawbacks of high salaries, incorporating concrete examples or statistical evidence could strengthen your position. For example, when arguing that high salaries deter skilled workers from leaving their country, mentioning specific instances or countries where this has been observed could make your argument more convincing.

The conclusion succinctly restates your stance, which is good practice. However, it could be enhanced by briefly summarizing the key arguments made throughout the essay. This would not only reinforce your position but also provide the reader with a compact and impactful recapitulation of your argumentation.

In summary, the essay makes a valiant effort to address a complex issue, presenting arguments from both sides before stating a personal opinion. Improving the clarity of your position statement, correcting grammatical errors, and providing more specific supporting details could elevate the quality of your essay significantly.

So you have to learn to read fast and note information in a chronological manner for presentation in the summary essay.","The essay under review attempts to tackle an intriguing topic about how diving mammals, like porpoises and cetaceans, adjust their heart rate for diving purposes. However, there are several areas that require attention and improvement for the essay to effectively communicate its message and fulfill its purpose. Here’s comprehensive feedback focusing on the essential aspects for improvement:

1. **Relevance to the Topic:** The essay begins with the intention to discuss how the heart rates of diving mammals can be adjusted or customized for diving. This is a fascinating subject, showing the initial alignment with a scientific or exploratory topic. However, the essay would benefit significantly from a clearer connection to the topic, especially concerning the relevance of the discussed studies or findings. Including more specific details from the original source material would strengthen this connection.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are multiple grammatical and stylistic issues that need to be addressed:
   - The opening sentence is incomplete. Consider revising it to something like, ""There are two divers, Freja and Sif, who want to customize their heart rate to suit the length of their dives with porpoises and cetaceans.""
   - The word “customize” is misspelled as “costumize.”
   - The essay would benefit from a more cohesive structure, with clearer transitions between points.
   - Use of the past tense (""was very deep"") is inconsistent with the context. Consider using the present tense for factual statements.
   - Consider breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones for clarity.

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:** The essay provides observational statements rather than a clear point of view or argument. It briefly mentions the ability of porpoises to control their heart rate but does not delve into an argument or specific viewpoint about this ability. Clarifying whether the focus is on the marvel of this biological adaptation, its implications for human understanding of marine biology, or its potential application would enhance the essay’s impact.

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Support:** While the essay mentions key facts, such as the heart rate control among porpoises and the influence of external factors like noise, it lacks depth in argumentation and descriptive support. Expanding on how these aspects were discovered, their significance, and possibly offering a comparison with creatures that do not have this ability, would provide a more compelling narrative. Moreover, incorporating the subtopics from the original source, which likely offer additional insights and evidence, would contribute to a more informative and complete essay. Subtopics might include related discoveries or further details on how these adaptations affect the animals' diving behavior.

In summary, to improve the essay and make it more engaging and informative:
- Ensure all relevant topics and subtopics from the source material are included and clearly connected to the main topic.
- Address grammatical and spelling errors for readability.
- Clarify the author's perspective and delve deeper into the subject with descriptive arguments and evidence.
- Consider structuring the essay to include an introduction, body paragraphs that explore distinct but related points, and a conclusion that summarizes the findings and reflections.

By addressing these points, the essay can be enhanced significantly, making it not just informative but also a coherent and compelling piece on an intriguing subject.",2,2,1,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Informative

I guess I will have to start with the basic structural problems of your sentences. Look at the way that you wrote the essay. do you notice the misplaced capitalized words which are not nouns and yet you used a capital letter to spell the word with? That is a basic rookie mistake and shows that you do are not aware of the basic English writing rules. Next, you keep starting your sentences with the connecting words ""And"" or ""Because"", both of which can only be used in the middle of a sentence that requires the connection of two separate thoughts or ideas in one sentence. These words are never used to start a sentence because there are no thoughts or ideas to connect when one is simply beginning to write his thoughts down. I also caught you using ellipses in a formal essay. You do not use ellipses in a formal essay as these indicate that there are additional thoughts not included in the presentation. If you do not present complete thoughts in an academic paper and make the professor guess, your grade will suffer. That is, unless you are writing a casual paper or a creative piece, which you are not. You must be conscious of the English writing rules and also, learn to review your paper for possible simple but avoidable mistakes such as ""Wwork"". This is one word that should have only had a capital W because it was at the start of the sentence. These sorts of errors show that you don't really care about doing the exercise properly, you just want to get over with it so you don't care if you make glaring mistakes. Please, learn to care about the grade that your paper will get by showing responsibility in the way that you write your essays.","Your essay addresses an essential topic – the importance of job satisfaction and its components. Acknowledging that individuals spend a significant amount of their life at work, you rightly stress the importance of a fulfilling job environment, salary, and opportunities for promotion. Your attempt to engage the reader with questions is a good technique to make your argument more relatable. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your points clearer and more impactful.

Firstly, pay close attention to the basic rules of English writing. Capitalization errors are frequent throughout your essay. Remember, in English, capital letters are used at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns, not arbitrarily within sentences. Words like ""work environment,"" ""salary,"" and ""promotion"" should not be capitalized unless they are at the beginning of a sentence or part of a title.

Secondly, you tend to start sentences with ""And"" or ""Because,"" which disrupts the flow of your writing. These words are generally used to connect thoughts within a single sentence rather than to begin new sentences. Starting sentences in such a manner can make your essay appear less formal and polished. Additionally, the use of ellipses (...) is not appropriate for formal essays, as it suggests incomplete thoughts. Ensure each sentence and idea is fully developed and clearly expressed.

Another point to consider is the importance of reviewing your essay for spelling mistakes or typos, such as ""Wwork"" instead of ""Work."" These errors distract from the content of your essay and can easily be fixed by proofreading.

Your essay could also benefit from clearer structure and argument development. Though you mention key factors contributing to job satisfaction, such as work environment, salary, and promotion, your arguments would be stronger if you provided more detailed examples and explanations. Discussing how these factors interplay to affect an individual’s well-being and job performance would add depth to your essay.

In terms of presentation, breaking your essay into paragraphs with specific points would enhance readability and organization. Each paragraph could focus on one of the main factors contributing to job satisfaction you’ve identified, allowing you to explore each one more thoroughly.

Overall, your essay shows a good understanding of the topic. With attention to English writing conventions, a more structured presentation of your arguments, and thorough proofreading, your essay can be significantly improved.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your letter correctly addresses the essence of a resignation by stating your intent to leave the company and your request for a reference. You've included personal reasons for your resignation, which adds a personal touch to your letter. This approach shows you understand the requirements of a resignation letter's structure and purpose.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**:
   - Watch out for the consistent use of tense. For instance, ""Looking it back these five years,"" might be better stated as ""Looking back over these five years.""
   - Consider more conventional phrasing for formal letters. For example, ""You and the company have equipped me with practical knowledge,"" could be revised to, ""The company and you have provided me with valuable knowledge.""
   - Minor errors in prepositions and conjunctions can impact readability. Attention to detail in these areas can refine your writing further.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your point of view as the author is clear—you are grateful for the experiences and mentorship provided and are seeking to broaden your horizons. Your respectful tone and the detailed expression of gratitude strengthen the impact of your perspective.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: While you've generally managed to express thanks and outline your reasons for departure, focusing on more descriptive arguments could enhance your letter. For example, briefly detailing a particular instance where guidance was invaluable to you can vividly showcase your mentor’s influence and your growth. Such specifics add depth to your narrative and strengthen your position.

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Incorporate a brief and specific example of how the mentorship has positively impacted your career or personal growth. This can provide tangible evidence of your appreciation and the relationship's value.
- Ensure consistency in tense and adherence to formal language standards appropriate for a resignation letter. Reviewing basic grammar and style rules for letter writing could be helpful.
- Clarify and streamline your request for a reference by directly stating its importance to your future career goals, making your letter's purpose even clearer.

In my opinion, I disagree with the suggestion that we should just read about books including accurate information only. \n First of all, nearly all of books in the world are written imaginary. Authors often write about fictional contents and characters. The most two common categories of fiction books are comics and novel. These kinds of books easily attract and make readers cannot take their eyes from the very first chapter, as it is happening in life.

For instance, I was really confused when you said: ""First of all, nearly all of books in the world are written imaginary. "" What do you mean by written imaginary? I think you meant to say ""are works of fiction."" I believe this confusion is because you are not familiar with the book genres (sections) which are: fiction, non-fiction, young adult, children's books, and biographies. Comic books fall under children's books or young adult, depending upon the age target of the book. So your reasoning, that a child cannot be given a history book to read is incorrect. There are actually history books written for kids. For every adult book, there is a children's publication counterpart except for adult themed novels. \n Another confusing presentation: ""...novel written by Margret Mitchell which ""Gone With the wind"" had shocked the world literary formerly, had no real occasion as well as character at all!"" \n What do you mean by ""literary formerly? The backdrop of that war was the American civil war between the North and South. The historical story was that of the freeing of the slaves. Why did you say that there was no real occasion? True, the characters were fictional but the historical reference was very much real. By the way, you are writing an academic essay. Practice formality in your presentations. That means, no triple exclamation points, no exclamation points at all. \n Your take on the essay shows that you understood the prompt, but do not know enough about the topic to be able to offer a convincing and correct discussion regarding the topic. Your unclear sentence presentations indicate a lack of English vocabulary skills. Try to think and write in English. Do not think in your native tongue then translate it to English word for word. That is the most likely reasons why your sentence presentations do not make any sense. \n At this point, I would have to say that you do not have the vocabulary and grammar skills with which to write a passing Task 2 essay. It would be better if you focused first on improving your sentence writing skills along with increasing your knowledge of current events and pop culture. These improvements need to be accomplished before you can start writing task 2 practice essays again. You may also want to review the other essays posted here first as a part of your learning process. \n The works of the other students here should help you gain a better understanding of the Task 2 requirements and how to best present it in the essays. Don't just assume that because you put some words together in English, that it will automatically make sense. You need to learn the basics of English sentence structuring first. Learn to write complete short sentences first, then work your way up from there. Right now, you do not have the ability to write coherent English sentences and paragraphs yet.","Your essay provides a position on the topic, suggesting that people should not be limited to reading only about real events, real people, and established facts. While you demonstrate an understanding of the prompt, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your arguments.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
You have chosen a clear stance by disagreeing with the prompt. However, in your introduction, you could better establish your position by explicitly stating the reasons for your disagreement. This would set a strong foundation for the rest of your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
There are several grammatical errors and stylistic choices that hinder the readability of your essay. For instance, watch out for phrases like ""nearly all of books in the world are written imaginary,"" which could be more accurately expressed as ""most books in the world are works of fiction."" Also, avoid using slang or undefined terminology such as ""literary formerly,"" which can confuse readers. Keeping a formal tone is crucial in academic essays, so try to avoid using multiple exclamation points or casual language.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
While your point of view is evident, it could be presented more straightforwardly. When discussing examples, ensure that your arguments support your stance clearly and directly. For example, when discussing ""Gone With the Wind"" by Margaret Mitchell, clarify how it supports your argument about the value of fiction, keeping in mind that while characters may be fictional, the setting or events might still be grounded in real history.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:**
Your arguments would benefit from more precise and logical development. For example, instead of stating that fiction attracts readers because it is like ""it is happening in life,"" elaborate on how fiction can explore universal truths through imaginary scenarios, making complex ideas more accessible and engaging. Additionally, the point about children's ability to grasp historical or political concepts could be refined. Acknowledge that there are books about real events written specifically for young readers, which counters the argument that non-fiction is inherently unsuitable or uninteresting for them.

**Additional Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Understanding Genres:**
Clarify your understanding of different literary genres. This enables you to make more accurate comparisons and arguments about the value of reading various types of literature.

- **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary:** 
Work on sentence structure and vocabulary. This includes practicing writing clear, concise sentences and improving your grammar. Avoid translating directly from your native language, as this can lead to unnatural English phrasing. Instead, think and write directly in English to develop a more natural writing style.

- **Engagement with the Essay Topic:**
Deepen your engagement with the essay topic by researching current events, pop culture, and various literary genres. This broader knowledge base will allow you to draw from a wider array of examples and arguments in your writing.

Remember, essay writing is a skill that improves with practice and feedback. Consider reviewing example essays and focusing on basic sentence construction. Over time, you'll find your ability to express complex ideas in English will significantly improve.",3,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

There are several causes for this trend, in my opinion, but I believe it is mostly due to societal evolution. However, I am convinced that a variety of measures may be taken into account in order to substantially avoid Internet addiction. \n To begin with, the social landscape has shifted drastically. As a result, various electronic gadgets were presented to the public, and several online social platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, were established. People may readily communicate with those who live far away. As a result, kids will be able to make acquaintances with a large number of individuals from all over the world. Teenagers have more freedom of expression in social media without any protestion. Furthermore, these online platforms generally offer user-friendly interfaces and appealing features. Instagram, for example, provides a plethora of filters that allow users to enhance their look without using make-up. \n As someone who knows a lot of kids who are addicted to online socializing, I believe there are some options to explore. First and foremost, I believe that schools should try to organize more outside activities aim to actively encourage students to interact with their peers. Furthermore, the government should enact rules allowing individuals to use social media for a limited period of time. \n I am certain that this is not a beneficial trend since individuals may lose a significant portion of their genuine relationships. To promote awareness, each person should be informed about the drawbacks of excessive use of social media.","The question that the original prompt asks the writer to respond to is: "" Is this a positive or negative development?"" It appears that the writer confused the writing instructions for this prompt with another discussion topic. Rather than the supplied prompt, the writer decided to write about a cause and solution essay instead. I am not sure how the confusion happened since the original prompt presentation is very clear: \n <em>Nowadays more people are choosing to socialize online rather than face to face. it is a positive or a negative development?</em> \n As the task requirements for the discussion were not met, save for the topic restatement, the essay will recieve a failing score based on an unrelated task response. Regardless of the other scoring considerations, the improper discussion consideration is what ultimately reflects more than half the scoring consideration. The essay does not have a passing chance.","The essay topic revolves around whether the trend of people choosing to socialize online instead of face-to-face is positive or negative. However, the essay primarily discusses causes and suggests solutions for what appears to be internet addiction among teenagers, deviating from the core question. This indicates a misunderstanding of the essay prompt. To align better with the prompt, focus on discussing whether online socialization is a positive or negative development and provide reasons and examples to support your viewpoint. 

While the essay effectively highlights the accessibility and appeal of online platforms and suggests practical measures to counteract excessive online socializing, it's essential to directly address whether these developments are positive or negative. The shift towards discussing internet addiction and its solutions, without explicitly linking these to the essay's core question, makes the essay stray from the expected response. 

In terms of language and structure, there are areas with room for improvement: 
1. The phrase ""protestion"" is not appropriately used in this context. Consider revising it to ""opposition"" or ""objection"" to convey the intended meaning more clearly.
2. The term ""Concider"" should be corrected to ""Consider"" for proper spelling.
3. The essay would benefit from clearer separation of ideas into distinct paragraphs, each addressing a specific aspect of the argument. This would improve the overall coherence and readability.
4. When introducing solutions, ensure they are directly tied to the essay's main argument about whether online socialization is beneficial or harmful.
5. To avoid generalizations, provide specific examples or data to support the claim that online socialization leads to a loss of genuine relationships. 

Addressing the essay prompt directly, providing clear and well-supported arguments, and correcting language inaccuracies will significantly enhance the essay.

Cultural values refer to core principles and beliefs upon which the entire community exists. Particularly, culture values are surely shown up through social norms, those have been formed for such a long time in a certain society. Hence, regardless of newcomers, those not conforming these social norms are likely to face with hostile attitudes by local residents. For instance, South East Asia residents will surely consider newcomers spoiled if their appearance is cover by full of tattoos. \n On the other hand, adapting social norms can be beneficial for newcomers in many perspectives. Firstly, regarding to those behave according to social norms, they are surely gain a richness of experiences from enjoying aspects of local customs and traditions. Culture conflicts generally results in social isolation, hence, establishing close relationships with the host community is considered as the top priority for majority of foreigners when living in a new society. Additionally, with the welcoming attitudes by local residents, in term of doing business, newcomers will definitely gain certain achievements. To illustrate, an entrepreneur will have a chance to maximize the profit if his products conform to the cultural values of local residents. \n By way of conclusion, with the purpose of being part of community as well as avoiding social isolation, it is truly essential for foreigners to behave respectively to the social norms of where they are living.","Can, the main problem with your essay is not that you did not accurately represent the opening statement (I will get to that later). The biggest problem of your essay is that it clearly shows a lack of English comprehension skills because you did not discuss the essay according to the prompt instructions even though you properly responded to it in the thesis statement of your first paragraph presentation. \n This is an ""emotional"" essay that discusses the ""extent"", another term for it would be ""degree"", of your agreement or disagreement with a given topic. You used the word ""strongly"" to discuss your opinion on the topic provided. That is good. It is an appropriate response as it indicates a degree of support for one side of the discussion. One side of the discussion. That is where your essay fell apart. \n In a proper discussion of this essay, you would have used the 3 body paragraphs to present, explain, and offer an acceptable example in support of your reason within the 3 paragraphs. You would have represented each topic in one paragraph each. You would not have discussed two sides within the body because the instruction given was not ""Discuss both points of view"". You were clearly asked to pick one point of view to present and discuss based on the word ""OR"". The word ""or"" means there is an alternative response to be chosen. Therefore, pick only one and strongly discuss the side that you support. Not both. \n Going back to the problem of your opening statement. Each time that you opt to use a run-on sentence, as you did in this essay, to represent a discussion, you will lose points. Specifically, your GRA and C&C sections will suffer severely from this mistake. A proper paragraph is always at least 3 sentences short, 5 sentences long. It is not one long sentence like the one you wrote. So how should you have written that paragraph? Let me see... \n <em>Every country has its own set of customs and traditions. Therefore, people who move to a new country in order to reside there must assimilate the new social culture they are living in. I strongly agree with this statement for a number of reasons.</em> \n While you did appropriately respond and represent the original prompt. Doing so in only one sentence meant that you did not pursue the possibility of gaining a higher TA, C&C, GRA, and LR score. Look at the obvious differences between your presentation and mine. Whose version offers the examiner an opportunity to get to know my English understanding abilities? Which paragraph represents a stronger grasp of English vocabulary use? Whose explanation of the discussion topic is clearer and stronger in presentation? Exactly. Always aim for a presentation that will fully utilize the available scoring criteria rather than going for the quick fix. The quick fix means you get the job done, but you don't get the maximum possible score out of it.","Your essay addresses the task of discussing whether people should adapt to the customs and traditions of a new country. Your stance, agreeing with the necessity of adapting to local norms to avoid social isolation and to integrate more successfully into the community, is clear throughout the essay. However, there are areas that could be improved to make your argument stronger and your writing more effective. 

1. **Response to the Topic**: You have responded to the topic, but the structure of your argument could be improved to align more closely with the prompt's instructions. The essay prompt asks for a discussion to a specific extent (degree) of agreement or disagreement. While you mention complete agreement, the essay would benefit from a more structured approach to discussing your reasons, focusing on supporting your point of view more thoroughly in separate paragraphs, rather than presenting a mix of perspectives.

2. **Clarity and Structure**: Your opening statement should be expanded to introduce your argument more effectively. A concise thesis statement, followed by paragraphs that each present a single clear reason supporting your view, would make your argument stronger. Remember, each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by explanations and examples. This structure will not only clarify your argumentation but also demonstrate your English comprehension skills and ability to organize ideas logically.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow of your essay. For instance, ""Regarding to a common argument"" should be ""Regarding a common argument"" or ""With regard to a common argument."" Try to simplify your sentences to avoid run-ons and ensure clarity. Furthermore, pay attention to article use (a, an, the) and preposition choices, which are common areas of difficulty but crucial for fluency and coherence.

4. **Vocabulary and Expression**: You’ve shown an effort to use a range of vocabulary, which is commendable. However, it's essential to ensure accuracy in word choice and usage. Also, be wary of overcomplicating sentences. Clear and precise language often has a more significant impact than complex language used inaccurately.

In summary, your essay would benefit greatly from a clearer structure that aligns with the essay prompt more directly, focusing on supporting your viewpoint in a structured manner. Work on simplifying your language to improve clarity and seek to correct grammatical errors. Keep practicing these aspects, and your writing will certainly improve.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Each student has their own level of comprehension, their own strength and weakness on various subjects. Because of these differences, students are hardly approach all important content without the assistance of a teacher. You can easily see this situation in any classes. In a class of a specific subject, for example Math, there are likely to be two groups. Group one contains students who are prompt and sensible in solving equations. They are energetic in class and excited to spend more time in solving Math problems. However, students from group two have difficulties in absorbing the lessons and are frustrated in studying Math problems. Therefore, the teacher will help group one advance their knowledge and explore more from the material while using the appropriate methods to guarantee group two to thoroughly learn the material. The teacher comes out to be the intermediate element between the lessons and the students. \n Secondly, teacher helps the students stay focus and prevent them from distraction, which are things young people usually struggle with. Students commonly get distracted by minor factors presenting in daily life such as smartphones, social networking websites and entertainment activities. They not only interrupt the studying progress but also make the students spend much time which is supposed to be invested in learning. As I mentioned above, there are two opposite groups that exist in Math class. Students from group two are more easily distracted than group one. Beside helping them learn the material, teacher also monitors them in order to assure they focus on the lessons, finish their tasks and do not do irrelevant things while studying. As a result, the studying progress with the presence of the teacher becomes more effective. \n In conclusion, I strongly agree that the teacher's responsibility is important for the students to comprehend the material. This is because the teacher helps the students approach the goals of the lessons and eliminates factors that distract the students from studying.","Dear student, without knowing the actual prompt that you are trying to answer, I still found myself highly impressed by the essay that you wrote.

There are just one or two points that I believe should be called to your attention as those parts have a direct effect on the way your essay would be scored. Is there any chance you can upload the prompt so that I can rest my fears about that aspect of your writing? \n In your paragraph about the teachers needing to prevent the distractions that affect the students, I am not sure why you had to circle back to the Math example. Normally, you should strive to present at least 2 examples in the essay. That is, 2 different examples. Now, in the classroom and during tutorial sessions, the students are made to put away their gadgets. So how exactly is the teacher supposed to prevent distraction during this learning process? \n You have shown a great deal of ability in expressing your thoughts in the written English word. If you can supply the prompt requirement, I am sure that I will be able to offer more advice regarding your writing improvement.","The essay effectively addresses the importance of a teacher's role in facilitating students' learning and managing distractions. The argument presented is logical, with a clear progression of thought, which makes the essay cohesive and understandable.

However, there are areas where improvements are necessary to enhance the essay's clarity and effectiveness:

1. **Response to the Prompt**: Without the exact prompt, it's challenging to confirm if the essay fully addresses the assigned topic. It's essential for essays to directly respond to the question or statement provided. Ensuring the essay meets the prompt's requirements is crucial for a satisfactory response.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay maintains a good level of English, which is commendable. To further improve, pay attention to minor spelling and grammar errors, as well as sentence structure to ensure clarity and flow throughout the essay. Using simpler language can help in making the essay more accessible to all readers.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay successfully conveys the author's opinion, believing in the significance of a teacher's role in education. To strengthen this viewpoint, it may help to explicitly state this position at the beginning and reiterate it in the conclusion for emphasis.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The use of a Math class to illustrate points is effective, yet the essay could benefit from incorporating a variety of examples. Discussing another scenario outside of mathematics could provide a more comprehensive argument and prevent repetition. Additionally, exploring both the positive and negative impacts of a teacher's role could offer a more balanced perspective, as examining contrasting sides can enrich the argument.

5. **Distractions Section**: In discussing how teachers manage distractions, the essay revisits the Math class example. Expanding this discussion to include general strategies teachers employ to minimize distractions across different contexts could offer deeper insight and avoid redundancy.

In conclusion, focusing on directly addressing the prompt, diversifying examples, and refining the presentation of arguments can significantly enhance the quality of the essay.

That is why I believe plastic bags should not be banned. \n The reason why many do not support using plastic bags is that they pollute the land and the water. Some individuals reuse but mostly throw plastic away as trash. If they are not collected, they would dug in and impair the soil. Sometimes wind lifts plastic bags to rivers and seas. Many marine animals eat them and die. Because of those risks, banning plastic bags seems like the only way to save the Earth. \n A big numbers support replacing plastic bags by paper bags but it would make situation worse by another destruction. Totally using paper means more forest would be cleaned. Then, the carbon footprint would be increased. The planet would be warmer and there would be more natural disasters. For example, Vietnam lost a large amount of forest area during the wars. Therefore, now floods come frequently and causes big damage to people and properties. \n T do not think thoughtlessly banning plastic bags could solve the environmental problems. Government should have stricter laws of collecting and recycling instead of totally banning them.","I found myself confused about the actual slant of this essay discussion. I had to review it twice to convince myself that the writer failed to follow the correct discussion format for this type of prompt. The third reading was what I used to definitely believe that the essay does not follow the required writing format. \n The first error in this essay is that the prompt restatement was not a restatement of the topic but rather, the personal opinion of the writer. The personal opinion is not considered a reflection of the paraphrasing of the given topic. The second error in the first paragraph is that there is a lack of measured or emotional response to the question. The writer needs to use words that show the strength of his belief in the statement. This is not a simple agree or disagree essay. \n A third error can be found in the discussion paragraphs. Being a single opinion essay, the writer will not recieve any score for the paragraphs that do not support his given opinion. Since only one paragraph somewhat supports the writer's opinion in this presentation, he cannot expect to receive a passing score for the presentation. The reason for the failure will be the collective results of the first 3 errors and the improper development of the reasoning paragraphs. There must be 2 full supporting paragraphs for the writer's opinion. It cannot be less than that otherwise the score will be based on an under developed explanation. \n The writer also failed to proofread the work, which will result in a lower GRA score.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to strengthen the essay and ensure it more effectively communicates its arguments.

1. Addressing the Topic: The essay starts with an opinion rather than restating the topic or question. It's important to begin by clearly restating the topic in a neutral manner, then presenting the thesis statement or main argument. This helps set the stage for the discussion and ensures that the essay closely follows the prompt.

2. Structuring the Argument: The essay requires a clearer structure to effectively support the argument. A more successful approach would be to dedicate two full paragraphs to thorough arguments that directly support the stance against banning plastic bags. Each paragraph should focus on a single argument, providing detailed explanations and evidence. This focused structure would help enhance coherence and persuasiveness.

3. Clarity and Conviction: The language used in the essay sometimes lacks the depth and conviction necessary to strongly convey the author's stance. Using more defined and persuasive language can help demonstrate the significance of the position taken and engage the reader more effectively. This involves selecting words that convey a deep understanding and strong belief in the argument.

4. Grammatical and Stylistic Issues: There are grammatical mistakes and typos that detract from the clarity and professional presentation of the essay. For instance, ""T do not think"" should be corrected to ""I do not think,"" and attention should be paid to grammatical structures throughout the essay to ensure accuracy. Additionally, phrases like ""a big numbers support"" should be corrected to ""a large number supports"" for grammatical correctness. Proofreading the essay before submission is crucial to catch and correct these errors, enhancing the overall quality of the work.

5. Proofreading: The importance of proofreading cannot be overstated. It ensures that easily avoidable mistakes are corrected, which is essential for maintaining the professionalism of the essay and achieving a higher score. Taking the time to carefully review and edit the essay can make a significant difference in how the arguments are perceived and how the essay is ultimately scored.

By addressing these areas, the essay can be significantly improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness.

However, concerns persist regarding the health implications and potential harm to the environment. This essay explores the merits and demerits of embracing insects as a food source. \n One major advantage of consuming insects is their exceptional nutritional value. They are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious alternative to conventional meat sources. For instance, crickets rival traditional livestock in protein content while being more resource-efficient to raise. This nutritional density could be a boon, particularly in areas grappling with malnutrition, offering a cost-effective means to diversify diets. \n Moreover, insect farming requires significantly less land, water, and feed compared to traditional livestock agriculture. This eco-friendly aspect reduces the strain on natural resources and diminishes greenhouse gas emissions tied to conventional farming methods. By incorporating insects into our food supply, countries can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices and mitigate environmental degradation. \n However, there are valid concerns associated with insect consumption. Some argue that insects may carry diseases or contaminants.","The essay will receive a failing score. You have not properly developed the discussion presentation when it comes to the merits and demerits of eating insects. You cannot have a 2 sentence reference in the last reasoning paragraph. You must always write at least 3 sentences, or a maximum of 5 sentences. That is because you need to justify the opinion or evidence you are presenting to the reader. As such, the second reasoning paragraph in this presentation is not convincing since you did not even put any effort into trying to explain the opinion for that paragraph. The examiner will acknowledge this as lazy work and give the essay a failing score because of it.","This essay tackles an interesting and relevant topic: whether incorporating insects into our diets could be a sustainable solution to the global increase in food needs. The essay does well in responding to the topic by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of insect consumption, making the point of view of the author clear. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to strengthen the argumentation and overall quality of the essay.

1. **Development of Arguments**: One of the essay's key weaknesses is the underdevelopment of arguments, especially when discussing the disadvantages of eating insects. Each argument or claim made in an essay should be supported with sufficient explanation and evidence. It’s advisable to expand on the concerns related to health and environmental impact by providing more details, examples, or data. Aim for at least 3 to 5 sentences per paragraph to ensure that each argument is thoroughly explained and convincing. This not only makes your reasoning stronger but also demonstrates a deeper understanding of the topic to the reader.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is relatively free from major spelling and grammatical errors, which is good. However, pay attention to the flow and coherence of your essay to make sure it reads smoothly. Transition words and phrases can help improve the connection between sentences and paragraphs, guiding the reader through your arguments in a clear and logical way.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The essay does a good job of making the author’s point of view clear by stating the merits and demerits of insect consumption. To further clarify your position, it could be beneficial to explicitly state your personal stance on the issue in the conclusion. This not only summarises your arguments but also reinforces your perspective to the reader.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: While the essay mentions several important benefits of consuming insects (such as nutritional value and environmental sustainability), it falls short in fully exploring the negative aspects. Without detailed and descriptive arguments on both sides, the essay may appear unbalanced. To improve, make sure to delve deeper into the potential drawbacks, possibly including concerns about cultural acceptability, possible allergic reactions, or regulatory challenges. Providing specific examples or studies can significantly strengthen your arguments.

In conclusion, this essay presents a solid foundation on an engaging topic. By further developing each argument with detailed explanations, utilizing smooth transitions, and clarifying the conclusion with a strong personal stance, the essay can be significantly improved. These changes will not only make the arguments more convincing but will also demonstrate a higher level of critical thinking and understanding of the topic.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4830,https://essayforum.com/writing/educational-policy-favor-certain-subjects-94203/,dev,Essay about educational policy which favor certain subjects,"MY ESSAY: \n It is sometimes argued that government should provide free education for certain university subjects that meet the social demands, while ignoring less popular ones. I firmly believe that despite some short-term benefits it might bring, this funding scheme will bring many more negative impacts on the development of the country as a whole. \n Focusing resources on training high level workers in certain fields may often help a country reach its temporary goal. Japan after World War 2, for example, was in a surge of demand for building back their ruined infrastructures, which certainly requires a large number of engineers, architects and other experts in heavy industry sector. Such giant task can only be achieved by training more experts in the desired areas, possibly through a government-funded program. By doing this, the country can secure a sufficient labor force for national key projects, and many students will also benefit from not having to worry about any financial issue while studying as well as employment output after graduation. \n However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by many adverse consequences, first and foremost of which is the great unbalance in workforce allocation. Covering tuition fees for students who study in areas relevant to society's interest only will make most students enroll in the corresponding subjects, which therefore will cause a lack of specialists in other important but not as trendy areas such as education and healthcare. During Covid 19 pandemic, countries that once put too much stress on natural resources exploration, like Venezuela and Argentina, have been forced to exchange valuable gold and oil for bread to feed people. Such unfavorable trade and food security crisis wouldn't have happened if those countries had focused on building more sustainable and balanced economy, part of which could be achieved by training more experts in agriculture. From students' perspective, a biased funding program also limits the accessibility to college education of poor but talented students, who should normally be the first on any sponsoring list. \n In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential drawbacks of this plan are more significant than any possible benefits.","The prompt restatement is slightly incorrect. The first presentation, which you are restating does not indicate that the government should ignore the students enrolled in less popular / socially imperative courses. Rather, it merely states that the government should not subsidize their studies as they might the other, more popular, and necessary courses. That incorrect section of the interpretation will receive a lower marking consideration since it does not truly represent the original content. However, the deductions will be offset by your good response in the writer's opinion. Although the thesis statement is not completely presented, the response provided is good enough to receive relevant marks for task accuracy. It could have been more completely presented but this will do for now. \n The problem is that your actual discussion uses (1) an oudated example in World War 2 Japan and (2) deviates from the possible correct discussion of how these scholarships could have an effect on educational policies. Since this is an advantage v. disadvantage essay, the format that you used was not entirely correct. The proper debate topic could have helped you stay on track in a better way. Such a format would have entailed: \n Sentence 1 - Advantage \n Sentence 2 - Benefits of the advantage \n Sentence 3 - Possible disadvantage \n Sentence 4 - Expand on the reality of the disadvantage \n Sentence 5 - (optional) An example that supports the disadvantage \n In the end, it appears that you have not clearly explained your opinion in this presentation.

The position taken is clear, arguing that such funding is more detrimental than beneficial in the long term. However, there are several areas where the essay can be improved for clarity, accuracy, and alignment with the task's requirements. 

1. **Understanding and Responding to the Essay Prompt:** There's a slight misunderstanding of the original essay prompt. It's important to note that the prompt suggests selective funding, but not completely ignoring other subjects. Careful attention to the exact wording of prompts is crucial to ensure accuracy in your response. Clarifying this misunderstanding in your essay could help make your argument more precise.

2. **Use of Examples and Arguments:** Your essay uses an example from post-World War 2 Japan to underline the importance of specialized education in certain sectors. However, this example, while interesting, appears outdated and may not fully capture the nuances of current education and economic systems. Consider using more recent examples or hypothetical scenarios that directly relate to today's context to strengthen your arguments. Additionally, your essay would benefit from a more structured argumentation pattern. A suggested format could include presenting an advantage, outlining its benefits, discussing a potential disadvantage, expanding on this disadvantage, and possibly providing a relevant example. This structure can help balance the discussion on advantages and disadvantages more effectively.

3. **Clarity of Opinion:** While your essay does present a clear stance on the issue, it could be improved by explicitly stating your thesis in the introduction and then reiterating your conclusion more compellingly. This ensures that readers are fully aware of your position from the outset and understand your final judgement.

4. **Language and Style Issues:** There are some instances of awkward phrasing and a need for tighter language use throughout the essay. Simplifying complex sentences and checking for grammar consistency can enhance readability and ensure your arguments are conveyed more effectively.

5. **Expanding the Discussion:** Your essay predominantly focuses on the negative consequences of selective funding in education but could benefit from a more balanced view that also considers how these policies might be beneficial. This doesn't mean you need to agree with the opposing view, but discussing it can strengthen your argument by showing you've considered multiple perspectives.

In conclusion, focusing on aligning your essay more closely with the prompt, using current and relevant examples, structuring your arguments more coherently, and clarifying your thesis statement will significantly enhance your essay. These adjustments will make your stance more persuasive and your discussion more balanced and nuanced.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Some maintain that minority languages will die out and some nations tend to keep minority languages. I reckon that most common used international languages ease our life quality and communication with different nationalities. On the other hand, we need to help improve minority languages. \n There are many languages in the entire world and two or three minority languages die out each year. Some countries try to save dying languages. For instance, Australian Government created a project to save the language and culture of Maori who are Australian aborigines. And there are other projects to keep minority languages such as American Indian language. \n However, worldwide job market usually requires candidates who can speak English or other international languages. People who cannot speak lingua franca could hardly be promoted at work. For example, some companies need an employee who can deal with foreign companies. So that most people tend to learn at least one international language that helps them to find a better job. \n Therefore, world needs one common lingua franca that should be spoken in any country. Consequently, one common language should be a required subject in every school. So anyone speaking one common language can travel without worries to any point of the world and trade their products. People will not be obliged to learn many languages. \n In conclusion, we should help minority nations to keep their languages for the cultural diversity. To ease the worldwide communication among nations, we should create a common language and provide courses of it. As a result, no one will face a language issue.","Dear student, your score for this essay will be a 1. I know, I know, that is a failing score. I wanted to give you at least a 2 on this essay but based upon the scoring criteria for the Task Accuracy portion, which is the first and foremost scoring consideration, the response that you gave in the essay is completely unrelated to the task. The tipping point for my decision is the instruction sentence in the original prompt. Let me show you where the mistake lies: \n <em>Original Discussion Instruction: To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?<br/>Your Discussion Response: I reckon that most common used international languages ease our life quality and communication with different nationalities. On the other hand, we need to help improve minority languages.</em> \n The mistake in your response is as clear as day. You do not, at any point in your opening paragraph, deliver a proper ""emotional"" response based on the terms ""strongly, partially, to a certain extent, totally, and other strong opinion representation terms. The essay asks you to take a strong, emotional response then defend that in your presentation. If you used the term ""I partially agree"", then you could have used this comparison essay in the discussion. However, since you did not accurately represent the prompt requirements by offering a correct emotional response, the rest of the scoring considerations could not be given heavier weight in terms possible scores.","The essay attempts to discuss the importance and implications of maintaining minority languages in the face of the dominance of international languages. However, there are several areas in need of improvement to better meet the requirements of the essay prompt and to enhance overall clarity and effectiveness. Below is a breakdown of feedback focusing on the initial questions asked.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay does not fully address the prompt's instruction to express a strong, clear position on the matter of international versus minority languages. Instead of specifying to what extent the author agrees or disagrees with the preservation and promotion of minority languages over common international languages, the essay presents a general discussion on the topic. To improve, it is important to clearly state a well-defined stance in the introduction and use phrases that indicate the strength of this position, such as ""I strongly believe"" or ""I partially agree."" This will set a focused direction for the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay contains minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that could hinder clear communication. For instance, ""I reckon that most common used international languages ease our life quality"" could be improved to ""I believe that widely used international languages improve our quality of life."" Additionally, attention should be paid to article usage (""the Australian Government,"" ""an employee"") and consistent tense. It would enhance readability to break down complex ideas into simpler sentences and ensure each paragraph flows logically into the next.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The author's point of view is mentioned but not strongly articulated. For more effective communication of the author's stance, it's crucial to use decisive language and back up assertions with clear, persuasive arguments. Instead of a general statement like ""On the other hand, we need to help improve minority languages,"" a more compelling sentence could be ""Despite the convenience of a common language, preserving minority languages is essential for cultural diversity and identity.""

4. **Arguments Supporting the Essay's Position:** The arguments presented to support the position are somewhat relevant but lack depth and specificity. For example, mentioning the Australian Government's project to save the Maori language is a good start, but further explanation on how such efforts contribute to preserving cultural heritage and identity would strengthen the argument. Similarly, when discussing the necessity for a common language for job market competitiveness, elaborating on how this need could coexist with measures to protect minority languages would provide a more balanced and nuanced argument.

**Overall Recommendations:**
- Clearly state your position to the essay topic in the introduction and maintain this focus throughout the essay.
- Improve grammatical accuracy and simplify complex sentences to enhance clarity.
- Strengthen your arguments with specific examples and explain how they support your position.
- Consider both sides of the argument to provide a balanced view, but ensure your own perspective is clear and well-supported.

Many people believe that authorities should use money for expanding and improving road in order to alleviate traffic congestion while others suppose it is better choice to spend the fund on building rail and subway network. In my view, I agree that, train and subway network plays a significant role in lessening traffic congestion for a long-term solution. \n On one hand, there are many reasons why government should invest money on building new roads to reduce the traffic jams issue. Firstly, it is easy for drivers to commute smoothly in roads which have multiple lanes. This could be because multi - lanes roads are able to cope with growing number of cars on road which existing road can not deal with. In addition, there are an increasing rapidly number of people living in inner - city. This leads to more individual cars are used on roads; therefore, building more and wider road is really necessary to tackle with the volume of traffic. \n On the other hands, constructing rail and subway network is considered as a long-term solution to reduce congestion due to some reasons. First and foremost, train and subway are capable of transporting not only hundreds of passengers simultaneously to reach their destination but also are likely to carry tons of things. It is obvious that without using hundreds private vehicles on the city, the road will be relieved the pressure on it. Furthermore, Trains and Subway have their own road. Thus, people can save a great amount of time instead of waiting time in the intersection and red light. In short, people are encouraged to used train in order to save time, money, and safer and the like. \n In conclusion, although traffic congestion can be addressed in certain level by building and improving road it seems to me that constructing rail and subway have a vital role to play in minimizing traffic jams for a long-term solution.","Dear student, since this essay is obviously for an English exam, I believe this is for an IELTS exam right?

The essay test is geared more towards making sure that you are not only able to express yourself in English, but that you also understood the instructions you were given for the discussion. Therefore, you need to share the original instructions with us in order to receive a qualified assessment of your work. \n Based upon the discussion that you presented in the body of the essay, it seems that you are being asked to discuss both points of view and then provide your own opinion. However your opening paraphrase does not indicate that. Which means that you did not accurately represent the prompt requirements in the paraphrase, this will lead to a reduced TA score on your part. \n While the discussion you provided may be on the mark in terms of discussion requirements, I can't be sure because you forgot to give us a copy of the original discussion instruction, that doesn't erase the mistake that you made in the representation of your personal opinion. It is important that you allot the 3rd discussion paragraph for your personal opinion discussion. That is because you need to make sure that you fully explain and provide supporting evidence for the side of the discussion that you support. \n One major weakness of your essay is that you try to discuss more than one topic per paragraph. In order to fully qualify the paragraph as fully developed, you must present only one topic for discussion with 2 sentences for supporting evidence and one example (if required or necessary).

Here's how to make your essay even stronger:

1. **Response to Topic**: Ensure your introduction clearly outlines both viewpoints as well as your own stance, as this shows you've understood all aspects of the given topic. It appears you've discussed both views but make sure your introduction accurately reflects this structure to meet the essay's requirements fully.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. For example, there are unnecessary spaces before and after dashes (e.g., ""multi - lanes roads""), and the phrase “increasing rapidly number of people” should be revised for clarity. Consider using tools or consult guides to check for common grammatical errors and improve sentence structure. Also, aim for consistency in terms like “Train and Subway”, which should not be capitalized unless they are part of a name.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay does present a clear point of view, especially in the conclusion where you side with constructing rail and subway networks as a long-term solution. To make your stance even more transparent, explicitly state your opinion in the introduction and dedicate a separate paragraph to discussing your perspective with supporting evidence.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While your essay mentions arguments in favor of both road expansion and public transit investment, the support for each viewpoint could be more robust. Each paragraph discussing a particular viewpoint should ideally focus on one main idea, supported by at least two sentences of explanation and, if possible, a real-life example. This structure ensures your arguments are both clear and persuasive.

Remember, an essay is more compelling when it thoroughly explores each point with well-developed arguments. Balancing your discussion between different viewpoints before presenting your own conclusion allows for a more rounded essay. Also, make sure to fully understand the prompt and structure your essay accordingly, with distinct paragraphs for each viewpoint and your opinion.

Lastly, never hesitate to ask for the original prompt or specific instructions to be certain you've fully addressed the requirements. This attention to detail will greatly enhance the quality of your essays.

However, the first barrier these overseas students encounter is the visa applying. Some people believe that the government should loose the restriction of applying visa for these students yet I state the opposite view that the government should not treat these students different than the others, and my statement are following. \n First of all, the main reason people support to relax the visa limitation is their identities-students. Compare to other applicants such as immigrants and businessmen, students seem much simpler. They visit for studying or researching and most of them will not stay for a long time. Secondly, it can encourage the exchanges between different countries in terms of academic, sporty and art. In order to improve the diversity, it is a good way to attract different aspects students from worldwide. \n On the other hand, I believe the biggest concerned about visa restriction is safety. Although the purpose of these overseas students visiting is studying, it is hard to supervise all the students' life. For instance, there are several cases that some girls from poor countries will pretend as students to those developed countries to do the sexual business which can earn the money in very short period. I suppose the government should treat all the applicants the same so as to prevent such situations. \n To sum up, it is good to have many overseas students to visit. However, under no circumstance should we scarify our safety only for welcoming these students.","Dear student, while your argument is sound, the example that you gave in support of your stand on the need to be stricter about visa requirements for overseas students is weak. You should opt for a stronger example such as the need to vet the applicants better in case they pose a danger to the citizens of a particular country. Normally, the possibility of allowing a terrorist into a country based on a student visa is the actual fear that grips the nations in terms of admitting foreign students. So such an example would better prove your ability to analyze the possible supporting evidence for your argument and also prove that you are up to date when it comes to the current socio-political discussions. Now, I noticed that you used the term ""scarify"" towards the end of your essay. Just for your information, the correct term is ""sacrifice"". You need to be careful about the way you spell the English words. The wrong spelling could either change the meaning of your word or, as in this case, make the sentence nonsensical because the term you used doesn't exist in the language. Save for these comments and corrections, your work on this essay is quite good. Grammar problems aside, you really showed that you are capable of discussing such a complicated topic in your own intermediate manner. Not bad at all.","The essay presents a clear stance on the topic of visa restrictions for overseas students, arguing against loosening these restrictions. First, let's highlight some positive aspects before moving on to areas for improvement.

**Positive Aspects:**
- **Relevance to Topic:** The essay directly addresses the issue of visa restrictions for international students, ensuring the topic is central to the discussion.
- **Engagement with Counterarguments:** There is an attempt to consider both sides of the argument, demonstrating critical thinking.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Supporting Examples:** The argument could be strengthened by using more compelling examples. For instance, instead of discussing students who misuse their visas for illegal activities, a more substantial argument would focus on the importance of vetting students to prevent serious risks like terrorism. This approach would show a deeper understanding of international concerns and offer a more persuasive argument.
   
2. **Spelling and Word Choice:** Pay attention to spelling and ensure the correct words are used to convey the intended meaning. For example, the term ""scarify"" seems to be a mistake for ""sacrifice."" Incorrect spelling or word choice can confuse readers or weaken the essay's impact.

3. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues:** The essay has some grammatical and stylistic issues that need attention. For improved clarity and professionalism, focus on:
   - **Verb Tenses:** Ensure verb tenses are consistent and correctly used to describe ongoing and past actions.
   - **Sentence Structure:** Varied sentence structures can make the essay more engaging and easier to read.
   - **Pronouns and Clarity:** Avoid ambiguous pronouns and phrases to keep the argument clear and direct.

4. **Point of View and Argument Clarity:** Though the essay presents a viewpoint, enhancing the clarity of arguments will make the stance more convincing. Make sure each paragraph has a clear main idea that supports your overall argument.

5. **Comprehensive Argumentation:** Try to address potential counterarguments more thoroughly. Recognizing opposing views and directly refuting them with strong evidence or reasoning can make your position more robust.

**Final Thoughts:**
While the essay takes on a complex topic with a clear stance, focusing on the clarity and strength of arguments, as well as addressing grammatical and spelling issues, will significantly enhance the effectiveness of your writing.

Others disagree, arguing that assignments should only be given during school hours, allowing students time for other activities and leisure. In this essay, I will examine both points of view and explain why I feel that a teaching program must take into account an individual's capacity and capability. \n Those who emphasize the importance of homework argue that if students devote more time to schoolwork, their productivity will increase. The more extra time they spend focusing on studying, the more likely they are to achieve good grades. This possibility drives further educational processes which might strengthen their set of knowledge and escalate students' learning productivity. If teachers only gave tasks during the class, the effect of study would be less preserved and would not be long-lasting. \n For others, the appropriate portion of schoolwork is imperative to the learning process. Children who have a lot of homework may have a negative impact on their lives. A pupil, for example, who spends so many hours on homework will have no leisure time and will sleep less. This negative impact can also have an adverse effect on students' mental health because they will be overwhelmed and get stressed easily. It would be preferable if they allocated time for other activities, such as sports and community service. \n In conclusion, even though homework is important for children's education, I would strongly argue that it has a detrimental impact on students' health and daily lives. As a matter of fact, teachers should think about how effective learning programs can help children achieve a better school-life balance.","Your prompt restatement is inaccurate as it does not use the same reasoning factors provided in the original.

Therefore, the prompt restatement will receive a failing score based on prompt deviation. There is no recovering from that mistake. It will cause the paragraph to receive a failing score. Most specially since your own writer's opinion is not aligned with the topics provided for opinion consideration.

This is an attempt to address the topic, but there's a critical misunderstanding of the original argument. The rephrasing of the topic alters the essence of the debate, leading to a deviation from the requested theme. It's essential to accurately represent the original arguments to ensure that the essay is relevant and addresses the topic directly.

Addressing the specific points for feedback:
1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to discuss the relevance of homework but fails to directly align with the original prompt's specific arguments. It's crucial to understand and closely stick to the original topic to ensure the arguments developed are pertinent.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally well-written with few grammatical errors. However, attention to sentence structure and word choice could enhance clarity and readability. Sentences like ""A pupil, for example, who spends so many hours on homework will have no leisure time and will sleep less,"" could be rephrased for conciseness and impact, such as, ""For instance, students overwhelmed with homework often face reduced leisure time and insufficient sleep.""

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay clearly states a position in the conclusion that homework is detrimental to students' health and daily lives. This assertion could be strengthened by consistently integrating this viewpoint throughout the essay, ensuring a cohesive argument from introduction to conclusion.

4. **Arguments Support:** The essay provides arguments from both perspectives but lacks depth in supporting the author's stance. For a stronger essay, include specific examples, evidence, or studies that reveal how homework can negatively affect students' lives beyond assertions. Likewise, when presenting the opposing view, incorporating evidence would provide a balanced and persuasive argument.

To improve, focus on accurately interpreting essay prompts to ensure alignment with the requested topic.

Opinion essay.,"Some people argue that schoolchildren should spend most of their time on studying local history rather than global history. However, I do not agree with this opinion because I think that these fields of historical study are equally important. \n On the one hand, the study of local history can increase awareness and pride of children about where they live. When children learn local history, this means they learn the history of a town, an old building, a church, and everything around them. Therefore, they can have a clearer understanding of the area in which they still live. Besides, when children hear incredible stories about national heroes from their grandparents, they are inspired to become a good citizen later. In other words, learning local history increases children's confidence and sense of achievement, encouraging them to protect their local community and traditional values. \n On the other hand, understanding world history is a cornerstone for children to become a global citizen in the future. The study of the global history can reveal the diversity of human experiences, which motivates schoolchildren to learn more about other cultures. When they develop curiosity, they will be ready to absorb new knowledge and work with others all over the world. It is impossible to become a global citizen without a certain level of curiosity. And the study of world history is a good way to stimulate that interest. \n In conclusion, I disagree with the view that children should prioritize the study of local history, because I believe that learning national and world history plays an equal importance in children's development in the future.","Van, I am confused as to the method of presentation that you have in this essay.

In terms of your discussion, I can only assume that you made a mistake in delivering your response since you indicated an opinion essay alone, but you discussed a compare and contrast with personal opinion essay instead.","The essay presents arguments on the importance of studying both local and global history for schoolchildren, which is a significant topic. However, there is some room for improvement to make this essay more effective and aligned with common essay writing expectations.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to address the topic of whether schoolchildren should focus more on local history or global history. However, the style of the essay seems to mix elements of an opinion essay with a compare and contrast essay. To improve clarity, it's crucial to decide on one approach. If the goal is to write an opinion essay, it's important to state your opinion clearly in the introduction and then support this opinion throughout the essay without equally weighing both sides of the argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally well-written with few noticeable spelling or grammar errors. However, to enhance readability and effectiveness, try to vary sentence structure and employ a wider range of vocabulary. Also, ensure that each paragraph has a clear main idea that is expanded upon with examples or explanations.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The author's point of view becomes clear in the conclusion, stating disagreement with the view that children should prioritize the study of local history over world history. To improve, consider stating your viewpoint more prominently in the introduction and then reinforcing it throughout the essay. This will guide readers through your arguments more effectively.

4. **Arguments to Support the Author's Position:** The essay provides valid arguments for the importance of both local and global history studies. However, to create a more compelling argument, focus on directly linking each point back to how it supports your main stance. Adding more specific examples or evidence could also strengthen these arguments.

Additionally, the essay needs to meet basic structural requirements. For instance, make sure the introduction and conclusion consist of at least three sentences to meet common essay writing criteria. This not only adheres to guidelines but also allows for a more thorough explanation of your viewpoint and a more persuasive summary of your arguments.

Remember, the effectiveness of an essay greatly depends on its structure, clarity, and the strength of its arguments. By focusing on these aspects and ensuring the essay closely adheres to its intended format, the message you wish to communicate will be more effectively received by your readers.

Firstly, customers are liable for being fraught with problems of delay in the delivery. It probably takes more some days for their purchases to reach their hand, which seems to be a real nuisance to those who urgently need something on special occasions such as Christmas and Tet holiday when sales volumes are likely to increase. In contrast, should individuals purchase in a brick-and-mortar store, they can receive it at once. Secondly, sending goods back would be a big headache because there have been striking variations between return policies of manifold e-commerce shops. Packaging, for instance, can pose minor problems. Worse still, it would appear that in some cases you have to bear the cost of delivery. \n Nevertheless, I am in favor of the opinion that shopping is increasingly facilitated by the proliferation of technology. The first justification is that prospective buyers may be empowered to achieve some substantial savings. When visiting boutiques, sales assistants tend to lure them into purchasing unnecessary items with clever advertising. That shoppers get to proceed at their own space, however, may enable them to resist the urgent to purchase everything. Moreover, those can also avail themselves of coupons from retail stores and free shipping, aiming to buy at bargain prices and decrease full amounts. The second reason is that online shopping could alleviate the transmission of pathogens. To be specific, it can ensure effective social distancing and prevent community spread, thereby exerting a positive influence on societies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Take me as an example, only with one click did I overcome onerous quarantine at home with a view to avoiding being potentially exposed to COVID -19 cases. \n To sum up, I suppose that simplification in e-commerce business powered by cutting-edge technology can be ascribed to assistance in saving money and a substantial reduction in health and safety risks.","Do not refer to recent technological advancements in the discussion since there was no such reference in the original prompt. Just remove the word ""recently"" and the restatement would be more appropriate. There is a confusion presented in the mention of the second point of view. That sentence is improperly structured. It should have said ""Others frown upon this practice"". When you mentioned the point of view that you ""subscribe to"", then the next sentence should have been the reason why you support that point of view. The repetition of the discussion instructions will result in a lower score since the writer's opinion remained unsupported in the thesis presentation. \n Focus more on the clarity of the reasoning basis than the presentation of reasons. I found myself highly confused by the constant reasoning, but little explained information to support it. The paragraph ended up being full of reasons, but lacking in clarity of thought and explanation development. The fact that the sentences were not well formed also added to this jumbled discussion paragraph. Next time, think of a good reason, explain the public opinion, then tell the reader what you think of that opinion. The examiner is looking for thought clarity, not reasoning numbers. \n The personal opinion discussion is well developed. I am impressed, even as the sentence structures are imperfectly written. However, the lack of proper public opinion referencing in relation to the 2nd discussion point will be a scoring drawback for this opinion paper. The writer should be using the 3 paragraph format presentation that works on explaining the 2 public opinions separately before presenting his own opinion in support of a public perception. \n As far as the score will go, the essay may get a low but passing score because of the missing discussion point and GRA problems. If the writer will focus on discussion clarity instead of reasoning number, he may improve his scores in his next essay.","The essay provides a good discussion on the topic of e-commerce, presenting both challenges and advantages. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness in conveying the intended message. Here are some points to consider for refining the essay:

1. **Topic Response and Clarity:** The essay responds to the topic but could benefit from a clearer structure and more direct statements of opinion. It's crucial to state your viewpoint explicitly early on and then support it with reasons. Instead of listing several reasons, focus on explaining a few in depth. This approach will help in making your argument more persuasive and your essay easier to follow.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are several grammatical and stylistic issues that need attention. Look out for proper sentence structure and ensure that your sentences are complete and clear. Avoid overly complex sentences as they can confuse the reader. Paying attention to these details will improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view is present but gets lost amidst the multiple reasons and examples. For a clearer expression of your stance, directly state your position at the beginning and use the body paragraphs to delve into the supporting arguments. This organization will help readers understand and follow your line of reasoning more efficiently.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** While you mention several arguments for and against e-commerce, there's a need for more detailed explanations and examples. Instead of briefly listing reasons, choose fewer points and explore them in depth. Explain why these points substantiate your opinion and how they relate to the broader discussion. Providing concrete examples can also strengthen your arguments.

5. **Essay Structure Improvements:** Consider organizing your essay into three clear paragraphs, each dedicated to exploring a different perspective. This structure will allow you to present opposing views separately before articulating your own opinion. It will also help in making your essay more organized and coherent.

6. **Focus on Clarity Over Quantity:** It's better to have a well-explained argument than several briefly mentioned ones. Aim for clarity and depth in your writing by thoroughly exploring the reasons behind your opinion. This approach will make your essay more impactful and easier for readers to understand.

7. **Avoid Unnecessary References:** Be mindful of the essay prompt and avoid mentioning irrelevant details. For example, the reference to ""recent technological advancements"" might not be essential to your argument. Stick to the topic and focus on direct responses to the prompt.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly improve the quality of your essay. Remember, effective writing is not just about presenting ideas but also about expressing them clearly and compellingly.

Personally, I am in the flavor of the latter for several reasons. \n - It is obvious that the economy plays an important role in the development of each nation. A country with the potential economic ability is able to limit the residents' poverty. By investing more in the economy, the government could offer a variety of employment for local people, which leads to a reduction in joblessness. From there, that country would not be suffered from financial burden from unemployed individuals. Moreover, the economy is also considered as a ruler to measure one nation's development In fact, when looking at a specific country, the first and criteria would be judged is GDP (Gross Domestic Product). According to the Administration Office, 2021 Vietnam's GDP was recorded at around 271 billion USD, which is considered as a strong developing nation. \n On the other hand, besides the economy, I believe that the government should pay more attention to different industries to become a totally-developed country. Firstly, governments should allocate resources to education. It cannot deny that education is crucial to a nation's future. If the children are not well-educated, they would get into illegal activities and become juvenile crimes, which would be a big problem for every country. Secondly, healthcare also should be invested. The government is ought to enhance the life quality of residents by building more hospitals and improving the welfare system. Once people are fully-supplied, they will devote themselves to their country, which would push the development of the economy. \n In conclusion, the economy is vital to all nations around the world, though, governments should spend resources equally in other indutries to develop comprehensively.","The writer has written more than the required wordcount, but failed to proofread, edit, and discuss the given topic in the assigned format. From spelling errors, incorrect word usage, and disconnected reasoning paragraphs, the writer could have avoided these scoring deductions if he did not prioritize the word count over the quality of the presentation. I need not point out these obvious errors. The student should be able to easily spot these avoidable mistakes if he takes the time to review the paper now. \n The writer even goes so far as to alter the topic foundation by offering his personal opinion in the first sentence of the restatement. A big no - no that always results in point deductions. The opinion is always at the end of that paragraph, consolidated with the thesis statement. \n The provided discussions do not assess the public s against the writer's previously given statement. To presenta cohesive discussion, the public opinion must be considered along with his apposition or support in the paragraph. General discussions like these are seen as personal opinion alone in most cases. Without the paragraph comparisons, these will only be scored in a limited manner.","The essay has several strengths, including a clear understanding of the significance of both economic development and the importance of investing in other sectors such as education and healthcare for comprehensive national development. The examples used to support the arguments, like the mention of Vietnam's GDP, add value to the discussion. However, there are areas where the essay could be significantly improved for better clarity and coherence, aligning more closely with the expectations of English proficiency tests.

Firstly, it's essential to ensure that the essay directly responds to the assigned topic without diverting or altering the foundation of the discussion. The introduction of personal opinion should be carefully managed and not placed in the opening sentence of the restatement. This approach can detract from the clarity of the thesis statement, which ideally should consolidate your position effectively at the end of the introduction.

The essay displays issues with spelling, grammar, and incorrect word usage, such as ""flavor"" instead of ""favor"" and ""wheraeas"" instead of ""whereas"". These mistakes, along with the presence of run-on sentences, could easily be avoided with thorough proofreading. Taking the time to review your work can substantially improve its quality.

Disconnection in the reasoning between paragraphs and within the argumentation process is apparent. It's crucial to present a cohesive discussion by directly comparing public opinion with your stance on the issue. The essay tends to present general discussions that could be misinterpreted as personal opinions rather than well-supported arguments. To enhance the effectiveness of your essay, ensure each paragraph includes clear comparisons or contrasts between public perspectives and your viewpoints, supporting these with specific examples or evidence.

Lastly, though it's important to present detailed and developed arguments, prioritizing the quality of your presentation over the word count is key. Overshooting the word limit without ensuring the clarity and coherence of your arguments can detract from the overall impact of your essay.

By focusing on these areas—ensuring direct response to the essay prompt, improving spelling and grammar, creating more cohesive and supported arguments, and maintaining clarity and brevity—your essay will become more effective and aligned with the expectations of English proficiency tests.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, there are several areas for improvement to ensure your essay fully responds to the task and presents your arguments clearly and effectively.

1. **Response to the Essay Topic**: The essay somewhat addresses the topic, but it lacks a clear structure that shows the discussion of both perspectives before introducing your personal stance. To improve, consider organizing your essay into five paragraphs as follows:
   - Introduction: Briefly introduce the topic and mention the perspectives you will discuss.
   - Paragraph 2: Discuss the first public opinion that leisure time should be used for activities that improve the mind.
   - Paragraph 3: Explore the second public opinion that emphasizes resting the mind during leisure time.
   - Paragraph 4: Present your personal opinion, comparing the two public opinions and explaining how they influence your viewpoint. This comparison is crucial to align your essay more closely with the task requirements.
   - Conclusion: Summarize your discussion and restate your personal stance, emphasizing the importance of choosing leisure activities based on individual preference and the benefits to mental and physical health.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors in your essay. For example, ""It's all about one's lifestyle,"" should have a lowercase ""it's"" within the sentence. Pay attention to punctuation and ensure consistent use of lowercase letters after commas. To improve your sentence structure, practice varying your sentence beginnings and lengths to make your essay more engaging.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your personal viewpoint is present but could be made clearer with a dedicated paragraph that compares the two perspectives before stating your preferred approach. This structure will help readers understand your position more easily and see how you arrived at your conclusion.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay mentions several activities and briefly touches on their benefits. However, incorporating more detailed examples and explaining why certain activities might be preferred by individuals based on their lifestyles would strengthen your arguments. Try to provide specific reasons or evidence that supports your choice, making your argument more persuasive.

In summary, your essay has a good foundation but can be significantly improved by reorganizing its structure, clarifying your personal opinion through comparative analysis, and refining your use of grammar and style. With these adjustments, your essay will more effectively discuss the topic and present a clear, well-supported viewpoint.

4839,https://essayforum.com/writing/social-networking-knowledge-sharing-chevening-88088/,dev,Social Networking and Knowledge Sharing (Chevening Essay),"I believe communication skills are necessary for networking. Networking is great for sharing ideas and knowledge, people use to build social networks or social relationships with others through various platforms. In my opinion, forming a connection does not only require communication skills but also must be influential. The connection is the most important thing in life. \n In 2019, I decided to work as a Village Facilitator for the Peat Restoration Agency of Indonesia (BRG RI). Peat care village is a program that functions to restore the hydrological function of the peat ecosystem. During the dry season in 2019, 60 village facilitators from 7 provinces discussed the initiative to take action to tackle peatland fires in their respective villages. We agreed to distribute N-95 masks to priority villages affected by the fire smoke. The distribution is prioritized for small children, pregnant women, and residents with special needs. I empowered women to improve the economy through purun product crafts from all villages on the island of Sumatra. As a fresh graduate, the things that I got on campus became more and more developed. Through this work, I have had the opportunity to grow my network. I had the opportunity to discuss with representatives of government agencies, health institutions, infrastructure, services, education, and others. I realize that the success of a program must be supported by the collaboration of each stakeholder. As a result, the village under my guidance is free from forest and land fires and has been able to run the economy through purun products. This success strengthened the trust between villagers and extension workers, making it easier for future program planning. Besides that, I also learned a lot from the many people I met during the process. Indirectly, connections and communications are made professionally and personally. \n If I am selected as a Chevening awardee, I will be able to join Chevening communities to develop my network with fellow international students in the UK. Upon the completion of my study, I plan to maintain this relationship by developing social media (Instagram, Whatsapp Group, Facebook, Twitter) as communication tools to share our stories. I believe that sharing various Chevening scholarship activities can provide new insight to others, and of course, open up useful discussion spaces. Through many relationship-building activities, I believe that this will impact my future career.","This is more of a leadership and influencing essay instead of a networking essay. You have shown that you have the ability to negotiate, plan, and enact activities. Your sense of empowering women and pushing to get things done as a fresh graduate shows leadership potential. Do not use this as a networking essay as it is not classified as one. Instead, develop the discussion more on the side of leadership and influencing based on a local government scale. That way, you show your actual potential to become a national leader in the future. You have the potential to create a strong leadership and influencing essay with this paper. You should not use it as a networking essay. Instead, write a new networking essay that instead, discusses how you created a network of companies and support groups to help you build an image as an efficient networking developer. Connect the network to your leadership essay based on the need for these companies to assist in your plans for this project. If you can connect the two essays, without mixing them up in the networking essay, then you will have a strong networking essay presentation.","This essay demonstrates strong leadership skills, the ability to motivate a community, and the successful implementation of impactful projects. It vividly showcases an experience as a Village Facilitator and the initiatives taken to address peatland fires, highlighting an impressive ability to lead, plan, and inform through action. While these qualities are admirable, the focus of the essay shifts more towards leadership and influence rather than specifically addressing the theme of networking.

1. **Response to Topic:** The narrative primarily illustrates leadership achievements and community impact but does not delve deeply into how networks were developed or utilized to achieve these goals. For an essay intended to focus on the importance of communication skills in networking, it would be beneficial to explore more explicitly how networking contributed to the project's success or how it helped in building relationships with various stakeholders.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written with minor issues. However, attention to detail could enhance clarity and readability. Ensuring consistent tense, avoiding run-on sentences, and utilizing paragraphs to separate distinct ideas could significantly improve the structure. Simplifying language could also make the essay more accessible to a wider audience, especially considering it is for English language learner students.

3. **Author’s Point of View:** The essay clearly conveys the author's perspective, particularly in valuing connections and understanding the role of collaboration in achieving social and environmental goals. However, expanding on the specific role that networking played in these achievements could make the point of view on the essay’s primary theme more evident.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position:** The essay includes detailed examples of the author's work and its positive outcomes, effectively supporting the idea that leadership and collaborative efforts lead to success. To align more closely with a networking focus, it would be beneficial to include examples that illustrate how forming networks directly influenced outcomes. Discuss how relationships with different stakeholders were initiated, built, and maintained and how these networks were critical to the project's achievements.

In revising the essay, consider reframing the experiences to highlight how networking specifically contributed to the success of your initiatives. Discussing the process of creating and maintaining networks, and how these networks supported your leadership efforts, could strengthen the essay's alignment with the topic of networking. This approach will not only underscore the communication skills but also show how those skills were central to building effective collaborations that led to meaningful outcomes.

By refining the focus and enhancing the structure, the essay has the potential to provide a comprehensive insight into the importance of networking in achieving social and environmental objectives, in addition to demonstrating outstanding leadership qualities.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Letter

Although I support heavy taxes because it will ease the economical burden of governments, high rates of taxes can result in more financial pressure on taxpayers. \n Governments can use the collected tax money to construct and improve the fundamental infrastructure. Amenities such as rail networks, highways, and academic institutions require huge initial capital investments. Though governments hold billions of dollars in reserves, it is difficult for them to pay these enormous amounts alone. Therefore, support in the form of taxes paid by the citizens of a country can greatly lower the expenditure incurred by authorities. For example, Indians pay fifteen percent additional tax known as the ""Education Cess"" to reduce the total budget outlay of the government. However, I think that imposing high taxes is sometimes not suitable because this money can be easily misused by some politicians. \n Large amounts of tax, on the other hand, can put unnecessary stress on a person by cutting down his savings. This is to say that a mediocre employee produces an average salary, and a little is left after further deductions of the basic expenses. Such savings will be nominal if there are large taxation rates. Furthermore, future planning, including investment for retirement, luxurious lifestyle, and children's higher education, would be impossible with limited savings. In Sweden, for instance, residents have to pay 57% of their remuneration as taxes, and due to that many Swedish people live under a huge debt of unpaid tax dues. \n To conclude, increased taxes can aid the governing bodies financially by lowering their overall cost. Nevertheless, I believe that charging excessive taxes can depress individuals by reducing their important savings.","This would have been a very good task 2 extent essay, if it was an extent essay. The problem is that the prompt requires a single opinion presentation that does not consider the other side of the discussion. Only a single opinion must be presented and supported by the writer's point of view. So using the comparative opinion presentation for your point of view was not the correct response format. Although, you did follow the correct format for the common opinion presentation. So, while there are some negatives in terms of scoring for that section, there are also some positives that just might save the starting score of this essay. \n Another incorrect writing format can be found in the actual reasoning paragraphs. All of the discussions were presented in a general, personal point of view format. The writing requirement for the discussion is to show that you are discussing other people's opinions aside from yours. Therefore, the use of proper third person pronouns was in order. Without it, the comparisons provided do not reflect the public opinion or explanation, which is a required element of the GRA scoring section. There are 2 types of pronouns to be used in this presentation, the first person singular pronouns and the third person group pronouns. \n While the essay presentation is strong, deductions need to be applied for the areas where it comes across as weak, mostly in relation to prompt discussion compliance and GRA expectations. Good effort though. Your work shows a potential to pass this test in a better than average manner. Provided you learn how to correctly present your discussion paragraphs.","This essay tackles the question of whether authorities should impose high taxes on individuals' income for developing basic facilities. The essay demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of both sides of the argument, providing examples and reasoning for the impact of high taxation. However, there are several key areas in which this essay could be improved to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test.

Firstly, the essay’s format does not fully align with the task's requirements. The prompt asks for the presentation of a single opinion, yet the essay explores both the advantages and disadvantages of high taxation. For future essays, focusing solely on supporting the chosen standpoint without comparing it to the opposing view would adhere more closely to the instructions. Concentrating on one perspective might also allow for deeper exploration and stronger support for that viewpoint.

Secondly, it's important to use a variety of pronouns correctly to meet the grading criteria. This essay primarily uses a first-person singular perspective (""I think""), which gives it a personal touch. However, to comply with the task's requirements and to make the discussion more comprehensive, incorporating third-person pronouns (""people"", ""they"") would help discuss broader opinions beyond personal thoughts. This shift will make the essay sound more objective and reflective of wider societal viewpoints.

Regarding language and style, the essay is well-written but could benefit from closer attention to minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. Additionally, using simpler language can make the essay more accessible and understandable, especially for an English language learner audience. Remember, clarity is key, and straightforward sentences often make the strongest impact.

The essay does well in presenting clear arguments and supporting them with examples, such as the reference to tax utilization in India and Sweden. To further enhance the essay, ensure that these examples directly support the chosen standpoint whenever you're not exploring opposing views.

In conclusion, focusing on a single opinion, correctly using a variety of pronouns, simplifying language, and ensuring all examples directly support the chosen viewpoint will make for a stronger and more effective essay. These improvements will not only help in better meeting the task's requirements but also in crafting an argument that is compelling, clear, and convincingly presented.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

While there are some good arguments in favor of the idea that these athletes are overpaid, in my opinion they receive fair salaries. \n The main reason why many people might disapprove of high salaries of sportspeople is that they do not make much contribution to society despite their huge income. Many skilled athletes earn much more than workers in other professions, like teachers and doctors, even though their roles are not as vital as these workers. Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi, for example, took in $127 million from his salary, earnings and endorsements. By contrast, high school teachers in the United States made a median salary of $60,320 in 2018; the best-paid 25 percent made $77,720 that year. Most people believe that we should therefore value professionals such as nurses and teachers more highly. \n However, I believe that the best sportspeople deserve to earn a lot of money. Firstly, being a top sports player requires years of practice and hard-work, and in this regard athletes could set good examples for young people. Secondly, a sports star usually has millions of fans who are willing to pay to see him or her play. Finally, sport is a multi-million-dollar industry; there are many firms that want to use popular sportspeople for advertising purposes, by making considerable investment into advertising their products. In Lionel Messi's case, $37 million of his income came from endorsements. \n In conclusion, although there are good arguments against paying huge salaries to sports stars, I would argue that they deserve the money they earn. \n (264 words)","You do not use ownership phrases throughout your body of paragraphs to represent the public points of view (2 points) prior to discussing your point of view.

A mistake that you made in the overall discussion of this topic.","Your essay provides a thoughtful examination of the debate concerning the salaries of top athletes. However, there are several areas where improvements could enhance both its coherence and effectiveness in conveying your argument. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** There seems to be a misinterpretation of the prompt. The task requires you to discuss both views on athlete salaries before stating your own opinion. It's important to clearly distinguish between the general public's opinions and your personal stance. A more balanced approach would involve presenting both views as equally valid before concluding with your own perspective. An improved introduction might say, ""There are different viewpoints on athletes' salaries: some argue they are excessively high, while others feel they are justified. This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting my conclusion.""

2. **Language and Style:** Your essay is generally well-written, but enhancing it with phrases that indicate ownership of views (e.g., ""Some people argue..."" or ""On the other side of the debate..."") could help clarify which opinions are public and which are yours. This technique adds clarity and fairness to the discussion by showing you understand and acknowledge both sides before stating your personal opinion.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your viewpoint is clear but could be more effectively presented by separating public opinions from your own. Make it explicit when you are summarizing the views of others compared to when you are articulating your personal stance. This distinction is crucial for your readers to follow the discussion accurately.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You've presented some convincing arguments, especially with the inclusion of specific examples like Lionel Messi's earnings. To strengthen your essay further, ensure that each paragraph contains a clear main idea supported by evidence or explanations. For instance, when arguing that athletes' salaries are justified because of the advertising revenue they generate, more specific examples or data could bolster this point. Additionally, considering counterarguments more deeply could enrich your essay, providing a more rounded examination of the topic.

5. **Spelling and Grammar:** Your essay is largely free from spelling and grammar errors. However, pay attention to maintaining consistency in tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement. Proofreading your essay or having someone else review it could help catch and correct these minor mistakes.

6. **Conclusion:** The conclusion successfully restates your viewpoint. For further improvement, consider summarizing the key points from both sides of the debate before reiterating your stance. This provides a concise recap for your readers and strengthens the coherence of your argument.

By addressing these feedback points, your essay can be significantly enhanced in terms of structure, clarity, and persuasiveness.

This is a commendable attempt to tackle a complex subject. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness.

**1. Response to the Topic:**
Whilst your essay touches upon the importance of mathematical and scientific education, it seems to miss a comprehensive comparison between the TIMSS and PISA student rankings, which is crucial for a thorough discussion on the subject. Focusing more on comparing these examinations and how they assess students' learning capacities could add depth to your argument.

**2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
There are several spelling and grammar errors throughout your essay. For instance, ""Mathematic and science are as main feature in industrial revolution era like now"" could be corrected to ""Mathematics and science are key features in the current industrial revolution era."" Additionally, pay attention to consistent spelling (e.g., ""mathematic"" should be ""mathematics""), and ensure proper capitalization for names and titles (e.g., ""western Western"" should be ""Western countries"").

**3. Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
Your point of view regarding the significance of education in mathematics and science is evident. Yet, the argument could be strengthened. Making a clear distinction between your analysis and the information presented in the sources would help. When discussing the comparison of students' performance across countries, specifying how this information supports your stance could lend more credibility to your arguments.

**4. Arguments and Descriptive Support:**
The arguments presented tend to be somewhat vague and lacking in specific examples or data to back them up. To make your essay more persuasive, consider including more detailed descriptions and evidence from the TIMSS findings. Discussing specific aspects of what the tests measure and how this reflects on the educational systems could be very enlightening. Also, touching on potential reasons for the performance gaps and suggesting actionable steps for improvement could make your essay more comprehensive and engaging.

- Begin by summarizing the topic more accurately, incorporating a comparison between TIMSS and PISA findings to set a solid foundation for your essay.
- Work on spelling, grammar, and punctuation to enhance the readability of your essay.
- Make your arguments more clear by explicitly stating how each piece of evidence supports your viewpoint.
- Add examples or data from relevant studies to substantiate your arguments, making your essay more informative and persuasive.

However, many people take a negative attitude toward this fact, stating that becoming old is bad, especially in the modern world. Others believe that old people's life condition is much improved nowadays compared to how it used to be decades ago. This essay will elaborate on both views. \n On the one hand, it cannot be denied that aging is something we all want to avoid. First of all, this process results in the deterioration of our body's functions. Specifically, the immunity system becomes less effective in old age, making us more vulnerable to diseases. Besides, an elderly's muscles are not as flexible as they used to be in his younger days, which put a constraint on his motions and deprives him of enjoyable activities such as sports. Secondly, getting old in this modern world might be a terrifying scenario for many people, because it puts them at risk of being neglected by their family members. The popular rushing lifestyle leads to young people's immersion in work, which simultaneously robs them of caring time for the elderly in their families. According to a recent survey, a number of old people reported that they felt lonely in their homes. \n On the other hand, improvements in science and health care services have made the life of old people much more bearable nowadays. New medicines and medical treatments are invented for diseases once incurable in the past, leading to an increase in human beings' life span. Moreover, social welfare and public facilities are also enhanced, giving the elderly more opportunities to be cared for by social employees or volunteers, when their family members are busy. Additionally, the government of each country has invested more and more in building nursing homes with suitable infrastructure, which enables old people to enjoy their lives with several intriguing activities in a community of other old individuals. Not only does this solve the issue of loneliness, but it also helps them realise that getting old is not entirely bad. Last but not least, technological advancements also provide the elderly with several innovative ways to entertain themselves. For example, even when home alone, one old person can still enjoy recreational activities online, using an electronic device with internet connection, which was not available in the past. \n In conclusion, although getting old is by no means a pleasant process because of its detrimental impacts on one's physical and mental health, I believe that old people have a much better life nowadays than in the past. The continuous development in science, technologies, health care services, etc., assures my belief and gives me a positive perspective about my own later stage of life.",<quotation>This essay will elaborate on both views.</quotation> \n You are missing the personal opinion.

So your essay could receive a failing mark because you did not follow the writing instructions.,"Your essay provides a balanced view on the aging process, discussing both the challenges and improvements in the lives of older people. However, there are areas that can be improved to make your essay more effective.

1. **Topic Response:**
Your introduction attempts to address the topic by presenting both sides of the argument regarding aging. However, your essay lacks a clear personal stance in the introduction, which is essential for fully addressing the essay prompt. Remember to clearly state your perspective at the beginning to guide your readers through your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
Overall, your spelling and grammar are quite good. However, be mindful of making your sentences too complex, as simpler sentence structures can sometimes more effectively convey your points. Additionally, watch out for minor errors and aim for consistency in verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.

3. **Clarity of Viewpoint:**
While you conclude with your viewpoint, stating that ""old people have a much better life nowadays than in the past,"" this perspective should be introduced earlier in your essay. Presenting your personal opinion solely at the end, especially in the conclusion, can confuse readers. Instead, integrate your viewpoint within the body of the essay to strengthen your argument and help maintain a clear and persuasive standpoint throughout.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
Your essay does a commendable job of presenting arguments to support both the negative and positive aspects of aging. You provide specific examples, such as advancements in healthcare and technology, which strengthen your points. However, to further improve, ensure that each argument is clearly connected to your main viewpoint. This means not just listing facts but explaining how these facts support your overall perspective on aging.

Remember, your essay should clearly communicate your stance from the beginning through to the conclusion. Include your personal opinion in the introduction and ensure that the arguments throughout the body of your essay consistently support this viewpoint. By following these guidelines, you'll be able to craft a more cohesive and persuasive essay.

Lastly, always double-check the essay prompt and writing instructions to ensure that your essay fully meets the requirements, as this is crucial for achieving a high score. Keep practicing, and with these adjustments, your writing will surely improve!",4,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative
4844,https://essayforum.com/writing/several-languages-danger-governments-spend-86154/,dev,Several languages are in danger - should governments spend public money on saving these languages?,"Numbers of languages are endangered by extinction, due to lacking the speakers. Although some people believe that the authority should allocate money for preservation, others think this act merely as a waste of money. This essay will discuss both sides of opinion and the reason I support to preserve languages. \n Some people think saving these languages is a wasteful action because these languages are spoken by a small group of people. If governments want to maintain these languages, they need to educate more people to learn these. However, people nowadays tend to learn the language which can interact more people, such as English. Tn fact, they think governments should pay attention to other important aspects instead of the minority group, for instance, education or health care. \n Despite the above arguments, I believe that it is necessary to preserve these threatened languages spoken by minority people. One of the primary factors is that language contributed to the heritage of cultures, passing the ancestors' wisdom and ethnic uniqueness down generation after generation. If these languages are extinct, every individual becomes to speak a single language and share the same culture, and there will be no difference among countries. As a result, governments should allocate money for preserving and maintaining cultural diversity that is the nation's characteristics. \n In conclusion, it might cost a large expense on protection and preservation, but it still is necessary to protect every cultural heritage and identity. Therefore, governments should take some efforts in maintaining these endangered languages and prevent them from extinction.","This is a 5 paragraph essay that should represent the following: \n - Paraphrase \n - Government should spend to save the language \n - Government should not spend \n - Personal opinion \n - Reverse paraphrase \n Since the original prompt uses the word ""extinction"", you should avoid using it in your restatement. Try to use a synonym for the word such as destruction, annihilation, elimination, or obsolescence / obsolete. Try to avoid using the exact words as the original because that shows a limited English vocabulary which will affect your LR score. \n Your essay discusses only 2 out of 3 points of view required by the discussion instruction which is: \n -Discuss both points of view and give your opinion \n You selectively discussed the prompt requirements, for which there will be appropriate scoring deductions for under developed and/or selective discussion presentations in your essay. This will prevent you from achieving a passing score in the overall scoring consideration phase.","The essay addresses a significant topic about whether governments should allocate funds to preserve languages that are at risk. It’s structured to express different viewpoints and concludes with a personal opinion, which is good. However, there are a few areas where improvements could make this essay more effective and coherent.

1. **Addressing the Prompt**: The essay attempts to follow the expected structure of presenting different viewpoints and personal opinion. It’s crucial, though, to make sure all required points of view are covered comprehensively. In this case, the essay seems to have missed fully exploring the instruction to discuss government spending versus not spending on language preservation. Including more on why some people might see the expenditure as unnecessary could balance the argument better. 

2. **Vocabulary Usage**: There's an excellent opportunity to showcase vocabulary range by avoiding repetition of specific words from the prompt. For instance, instead of using ""extinction"" repeatedly, consider synonyms such as ""annihilation"" or ""obsolescence."" This approach demonstrates a broader vocabulary and enhances your language score.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: The essay’s intent is generally clear, but it could benefit from more explicit transitions and connections between ideas. Make sure each paragraph flows logically to the next, with clear reasons supporting each point of view before stating your own opinion.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay has minor errors, paying close attention to spelling and grammatical structure is vital. For example, ""the reason I support to preserve languages"" could be clearer and grammatically correct as ""the reasons why I support preserving languages."" Also, watch out for typographical errors like ""Tn fact"" instead of ""In fact.""

5. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay provides basic reasons for both viewpoints but could be strengthened with more detailed examples or evidence. When arguing for language preservation, mentioning specific benefits or historical instances where preserving a language had a positive impact could be persuasive.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion summarizes the points made, which is good practice. However, it could be made stronger by briefly restating the significance of cultural diversity and heritage conservation in addition to the need for government action.

In summary, focusing on fully answering the prompt, expanding vocabulary usage, enhancing the clarity and coherence of ideas, correcting grammatical errors, enriching the content with detailed arguments, and making a more impactful conclusion could significantly improve the essay. These adjustments will not only make the essay more compelling but also demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency.",3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4845,https://essayforum.com/writing/owning-home-renting-one-important-people-91082/,dev,Why owning a home rather than renting one is important for people? Is this negative or positive?,"Owning or renting a house is not only the decision of investment or choice of living style, but more involved with social psychology. Young people discuss this topic day by day, year by year when they are in the door of getting married or in the pressure of adult life. In some countries, mostly in Asia, residents are more inclined to own a house than renting one. This situation can be explained in 3 main reasons from my point of view. \n The world we live in now is full of the pressure of being successful. After decades, the words ""I am gifted. So are you!"" become a nightmare for the youth rather than an encouragement. Not all of us can be as talented as others with this kind of autosuggestion. But the extreme expectations of parents, especially Asia, on their children somehow lead to a stressful generation, who is living by social standards. One of those popular criteria to figure out a successful man is possessing a home. This implies a person has a high-salary stable job, money earning capability and of course, he is appreciated as gifted! \n Another insight of owning a home is the feeling of stability. Many people at the age of 25 - 35, who are in the process of purchasing an apartment or a house, confess that after years of experience changing accommodations, they desire to settle down at a place to avoid the remarkable drawback when renting one is the anxiety of moving when the contract expired. \n Moreover, satisfied emotion must be mentioned as a significant explanation why possessing a home is the majority's preference. As I mentioned in the second paragraph, social standard also forms a perception of happiness and success through owning property. A house is in the same figure of expensive stuff, which can bring human temporarily feeling of satisfy when obtained a target in life. \n Cannot come to conclusion whether putting effort into owning a home is negative or positive. But I stand by the notion that aiming to accumulate as much property as possible is a way of challenging our ability and ensuring our future.","The prompt restatement veers away from the orginal presentation because, rather than simply restating the topic, the writer has chosen to begin the discussion of his personal opinion at the very start of the paragraph. There are 2 areas in a Task 2 essay where the personal opinion should not be presented or discussed. These areas are: \n - Prompt restatement + personal opinion \n - Concluding summary \n Both areas should not deviate as these will affect the preliminary and final TA score. For the first paragraph, 3 sentences will be acceptable as long as it storyp close to the original discussion. For the concluding summary just repeat the topic, your opinion, and reasons. Failure to do that will result in a non-passing score.","The essay touches upon a relevant and engaging topic regarding the choice between owning and renting a house, examining it from a social psychology perspective, particularly in the context of societal pressures in Asian countries. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of the argument presented.

Firstly, it's crucial to ensure the opening of the essay accurately restates the topic without introducing personal opinions. The introduction serves as foundational groundwork for what's to come; thus, it should offer a clear indication of the topic being addressed without veering into personal viewpoints. Keeping the initial paragraph focused on the topic sets a strong base for developing the argument in subsequent paragraphs.

There are noticeable spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. For instance, there are minor errors such as ""concider"" which should be spelled ""consider,"" and ""the door of getting married"" which could be more clearly phrased as ""the threshold of marriage."" To improve the essay's readability and professional tone, it is recommended to conduct a thorough proofread focusing on these aspects. Additionally, some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly structured, making them difficult to follow. Simplifying these sentences can aid in conveying your points more effectively.

The point of view of the author comes through; however, it merges personal opinion with general discussion too early, particularly in the introductory section. It's better to separate your personal stance from general statements until later in the essay, ideally reserving it for a concluding statement where it can be tied together coherently with the supporting arguments provided.

While there are arguments presented that aim to support the preference for owning a home, they could benefit from being more explicit and detailed. For instance, when discussing societal pressures and expectations, incorporating specific examples or statistics could strengthen the argument. Expanding on how these pressures directly influence the preference for homeownership would provide a clearer and more persuasive narrative.

Regarding the conclusion, it's important to succinctly restate the topic, your stance, and the supporting reasons without introducing new information or diverging from the established argument. The conclusion should serve as a concise summary that reinforces the main points discussed, providing closure to the argument in a way that aligns with the rest of the essay.

Overall, focusing on a clearer segregation of personal opinions, attending to spelling and grammatical accuracy, streamlining sentence structure, and enhancing the depth of the arguments with specific examples will significantly elevate the quality of the essay. By addressing these areas, the essay will not only present a more polished and professional appearance but will also offer a more compelling and persuasive argument.",3,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

With respect to the solutions to this problem, I will put forward some that are possibly done to minimize it. \n Firstly, the authority should enlarge the road system. At times, that there are only a few narrow roads located right in the city center is the main cause of traffic jam. Therefore, they had better proliferate more motorways to lower the pressure that vehicles put on main routes during rush hours and also by doing that, give the citizens the pleasure of not having to wait desperately in the long lines of transportations. \n Secondly, in addition to widening the road system, the government should enhance the utility of public transport on the grounds that private means of transportation occupy a lot of road space and can cause congestion. To do this, they ought to encourage people to travel mainly by buses and underground which can contain a lot of people. Through many privileges such as: inexpensive, convenient, environmentally friendly,...., public transport definitely the best alternative to cars-the vehicle which can easily get bogged down with traffic jams. \n Finally, laws must be promulgated strictly and clearly to cope with all the activities and means of transportation that can bring about traffic jams and traffic accidents. The traffic policemen must immediately be mobilized when there are congestions or car crashes to tackle the situations as fast as possible. Simultaneously, cars and motorcycles have to be completely prohibited from the city center in the interest of the high possibilities of triggering heavy traffic, accidents, and also, to some extent, the detrimental gases they release during rush hours. \n In brief, dealing with traffic jams and traffic accidents is very necessary to develop a comprehensive traffic environment and the government should do everything in their power to reduce or even get rid of these. However, we-the citizens- from all ages and all classes of the society should also be aware of the seriousness of these problems and therefore, conform to the government's measures critically.","This is a 4 paragraph essay that utilizes only 2 reasoning paragraphs.

Your thesis statement is not clear. It does not tell me exactly what topics you will be discussing based on the subjects. You only imply a discussion, which does not help to pre-summarize your discussion presentation. \n Avoid exaggerated presentations. It is acceptable for you to refer to the topic as concerning, but not as controversial as there is no reference to such a situation in the original presentation. Examiners do not like it when students exaggerate the topic presentation because it often leads to misdirected discussion points in the reasoning paragraphs. \n You also cannot use 3 punctuation marks successively in a sentence. That is going to severely reduce your GRA score due to your obvious lack of grammar and punctuation usage.","The essay presents valuable ideas on how to address traffic jams and traffic accidents, highlighting potential solutions like expanding the road system, promoting public transportation, and enforcing strict traffic laws. However, to enhance clarity and effectiveness, the following points need consideration:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay effectively addresses the issue of traffic congestion and accidents, which is commendable. Yet, it's crucial to ensure the introduction clearly outlines the topics to be discussed, specifically stating the causes and solutions in a more defined manner. This will help in providing a clearer roadmap of the essay's content.

2. **Structure and Format**: The essay should adhere to an organized format. Typically, an essay of this nature would greatly benefit from a clear thesis statement early on, specifying the main arguments to be explored. Additionally, aim to include a balanced discussion by dedicating specific paragraphs to discussing causes and solutions, ensuring coherence in the essay structure.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay displays a good level of language use, though it's important to observe proper punctuation rules. Using three punctuation marks in succession can disrupt the flow and clarity, impacting readability. Aim to simplify complex sentences and ensure punctuation is used correctly throughout the essay.

4. **Presentation of Arguments**: While the essay's point of view is clear, supporting arguments could be made more precise by avoiding exaggeration. It's beneficial to present issues like traffic jams in a measured tone. Exaggeration can divert attention from the main arguments and weaken the essay's impact. Ensure that each proposed solution is backed by a strong rationale, clearly linking each suggestion to how it would effectively reduce traffic problems.

5. **Perspective and Tone**: It's vital to maintain an objective and balanced perspective throughout the essay. While it's acceptable to describe traffic issues as concerning, referring to them as controversial without presenting opposing viewpoints or discussions can be misleading. Focus on maintaining a factual and neutral tone, especially when depicting the severity of an issue.

In conclusion, the essay has a solid foundation with relevant ideas on solving traffic issues. Focusing on refining the thesis statement, adhering to a structured format, observing punctuation rules, presenting arguments without exaggeration, and maintaining a balanced and factual tone will significantly enhance the essay's quality and effectiveness.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

While the essay covers important points, there are areas that could be significantly improved to enhance its effectiveness and compliance with English proficiency test standards.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay does address the impact of computers in education by discussing their advantages and disadvantages. However, it seems to lack a direct response to a specific prompt or question. Most English proficiency tests, like the IELTS, require addressing a specific question and incorporating a personal opinion on the matter. It's important to read the prompt carefully, ensure understanding, and structure the essay to directly and fully respond to that prompt. Including a personal opinion, when required, and differentiating it clearly from the general discussion would also be vital.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are a few spelling errors (e.g., ""concider"" should be ""consider"", ""inflection"" should be ""infection"", ""data less"" should likely be ""data loss"") and grammatical issues (e.g., ""computer is being used"" could be better as ""computers are increasingly used"", ""has not install"" should be ""has not installed"") that need attention. Also, there are instances of awkward phrasing (e.g., ""a encyclopedia"" should be ""an encyclopedia"") that could be clarified. Improving these aspects will enhance the clarity and professionalism of the essay.

3. **Author’s Point of View**: The point of view is mostly clear, indicating an understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of computer use in education. However, explicitly stating a personal stance on whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, or vice versa, could enhance the essay by providing a clearer viewpoint.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The essay does introduce arguments regarding the pros and cons of computer use in education. To improve, consider expanding these points with more specific examples, real-life applications, or statistical evidence to support the claims made. This deepens the reader's understanding and makes the argument more convincing.

**Overall Suggestions**:
- Aim to meet the word count and structural requirements for English proficiency tests (e.g., 250 words minimum, organized into a paraphrased prompt, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion).
- Be sure to address the essay prompt fully, including any required personal opinion. This will ensure the essay is deemed relevant and complete.
- Focus on refining the grammar, spelling, and style to enhance readability and correctness.
- Provide more detailed examples and evidence to strengthen the arguments regarding the advantages and disadvantages of computer use in education.

On recognizing the consequences of this scenario, I fully agree with the idea. \n Admittedly, a lawless society is bound to face chaos and havoc. A community without guidelines and regulations is the perfect environment for crimes and misdemeanors. The public would have to constantly live in fear, knowing murders could be out there killing people but did not face any consequences for their actions. Moreover, crimes always leave dreadful results to victims involved. For instance, the injured party of a hit-and-run suffers from extreme effects, both mentally and physically, from the crash. If the person causing the accident were not punished appropriately for their wrongdoings, it would set a bad example for other members of the community. These examples serve to show that a society without the presence of law could cause social unrest and put citizens at risk. \n For the above reasons, laws and regulations must be set in motion to maintain order in society. The laws would work as boundaries, in which people still have their own freedom and they can do whatever they wish to as long as they abide by the laws. With the existence of rules and regulations, law-breakers are punished rightfully for crossing the lines, violating others' rights and benefits. \n In conclusion, I truly believe that society would not be able to function if laws, regulations, and rules were not set in place.","<quotation>I fully agree with the idea.</quotation> \n Based on what reasons?

The topic is addressed directly with a stated agreement on the necessity of laws for societal function. However, there are several areas where the essay could be significantly improved to enhance clarity, depth, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, the essay mentions agreement with the necessity for laws based on recognized consequences but fails to elaborate sufficiently on these consequences. When stating an opinion, it's crucial to support it with specific reasons. This not only strengthens the argument but also makes your viewpoint clearer to the reader. Consider adding a paragraph that outlines the reasons behind your stance in more detail.

Additionally, you've provided examples to support the argument but mentioned ""reasons"" in a plural form when, in reality, you provided a singular overarching reason centered around chaos and havoc in a lawless society. Paying attention to singular versus plural usage can help avoid confusing the reader. More so, distinguishing between your main reason and the examples supporting it could improve the organization of your essay. Each main point or reason could be explored in its own paragraph, followed by examples that illustrate this point in action rather than merging them together. Separating them allows for a deeper exploration of each point and enhances readability.

Your examples illustrating the consequences of a society without laws are strong; however, expanding on these examples in separate paragraphs could allow for a more thorough demonstration of your argument. This more detailed structure would provide a more rigorous examination of the issue at hand.

Regarding the conclusion, it succinctly restates the main argument but lacks a comprehensive summary of the discussion. Expanding the conclusion to include a brief recapitulation of your key points and examples would not only solidify your argument but also give the reader a memorable takeaway. Ideally, a three-sentence structure could be employed here to wrap up the discussion effectively, reiterating the stance, summarizing the supporting reasons and examples, and ending with a concluding remark that emphasizes the significance of the topic.

Lastly, while there are few explicit grammar or spelling mistakes, paying close attention to the specificity of language (e.g., avoiding general statements without support, clarifying singular versus plural) can further improve the essay. These revisions would allow for a clearer, more compelling argument that's well-supported and organized.

However, there are several areas for improvement to make the essay clearer and more impactful.

1. Several sentences in the essay are confusing or incomplete, which makes it difficult for readers to understand the intended message. For example, the phrase ""We should not computer-based"" lacks a clear subject and verb agreement, leaving readers unsure of what is being communicated. It would be more effective to rephrase this as ""We should not rely solely on computer-based translations."" Similarly, the question ""what if we do not bring computers along with?"" is incomplete. A clearer version might be, ""What if we cannot bring computers with us?""

2. The essay has spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For example, the use of ""concider"" should be corrected to ""consider."" Additionally, ensuring sentences have clear subjects and proper grammatical structure will greatly enhance readability and coherence. Paying attention to verb tense consistency and using articles (""a,"" ""an,"" ""the"") correctly will also improve the essay's quality.

3. The author's point of view is somewhat clear - advocating for the value of learning languages despite the capabilities of computers. To strengthen this viewpoint, providing more concrete examples or personal experiences could make the argument more compelling and tangible to readers.

4. While the essay attempts to support the author's position with arguments about the benefits of learning languages (such as understanding culture, reading literature, and experiencing life differently), these points could be more detailed and descriptive. Elaborating on how learning a language enriches personal experience or citing specific instances where language learning has opened doors that technology could not would offer stronger support for the author's stance.

So learning a modern language at primary school is mandatory. \n On the other hand, other people think that at primary school, kids start to discover what is education, how to write, read and manipulate numbers, children have to learn those basic things in their mother tongue language, start learning a new language is very unnecessary at this period, it will has just a negative consequences for the children's education future by disturbing them on focusing \n On basic mathematic or physic rules. Modern language is definitely a plus for kids but secondary school is the best time to learn it. I agree. \n To conclude, I believe that modern languages are very important to be taught the secondary school, at this period students just start to release what is important for them and what is not. The time period of giving courses to our children is crucial, we have to be careful with it.","Dear student, you can't just agree with an opinion in the essay when you are clearly being asked to present your own opinion and defend it alongside the two points of view that you have to discuss. So, you should have 3 paragraphs in this essay body that should represent 3 things: the pro, the con, and your opinion. You represent 2 out of 3 at this point. That explains why your paragraphs are short by one. You did not properly represent and discuss your opinion in support of one of the two sides you are expected to present within the discussion. It seems that you decided to present your opinion as the conclusion to the essay. You cannot do that. You are not allowed to present a new discussion within the conclusion as a closing statement. That is because the recap of the essay discussion is expected to be placed in the concluding paragraph. Needless to say, your essay has plenty of room for improvement in terms of task accuracy, coherence and cohesion, as well as the lexical resource and grammar accuracy. In fairness to you, I won't score your essay using the criteria previously mentioned so that you will have a chance to revise your essay to better be prompt adherent.","The essay provides a thoughtful examination of when children should start learning a second language, discussing the benefits and drawbacks of beginning this process in either primary or secondary school. However, there are several key areas where improvement is essential for clarity, coherence, and adherence to the given task requirements.

Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that the essay directly responds to the topic by clearly presenting personal opinions and analyzing both sides of the argument. While the essay attempts to address the issue, it falls short in fully developing a third paragraph that should articulate the personal stance in greater detail. Rather than merely stating agreement with one side in the conclusion, it's important to dedicate a specific section of the body to explore and support your own viewpoint.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are noticeable errors that could hinder understanding. For instance, watch for instances of plural agreement (""believes"" should be ""believe""), and be mindful of the difference between ""memoir"" and ""memory."" Additionally, aiming for clearer and more precise language will enhance the essay's readability and effectiveness. Phrases like ""phenomenal memoir abilities"" could be simplified to ""excellent memory skills"" for greater clarity.

The essay's point of view is indicated, but as mentioned, this perspective needs to be developed more fully within its own dedicated section of the essay. This approach will not only strengthen the argument but also ensure the structure is more aligned with the expectations for this task, which looks for a balanced discussion followed by a personal viewpoint.

In terms of argument support, while the essay provides examples and reasoning, it could benefit from more detailed and descriptive arguments. For example, when discussing the capabilities of children learning languages at an early age, incorporating specific studies or statistics could bolster the argument's credibility. Additionally, considering potential counterarguments more deeply would enrich the critical analysis and demonstrate a broader understanding of the issue.

To conclude, focusing on creating a clear, structured argument that includes a distinct personal viewpoint will greatly improve the essay. Addressing grammatical and stylistic issues will aid in making the essay more coherent and engaging. Taking these steps will not only clarify the author's stance but also provide a more compelling and comprehensive discussion of the topic at hand.",3,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Or general welfare?,"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n In ancient era, a so called ""great"" emperor is defined by how much he had done for all his people. For example, if he launched lots of public facilities with most of the wealth he has, which is usually spent for the emperor himself making his palace and life more luxury, he would be considered as a good leader of the country because he takes general welfare as priority. In most of the cases, those empires are memorized by people for its prosperity due to the gentle leader. \n However, in modern days, living in a democratic society, I don't think that those efforts made by the government are sympathetic or generous but somehow normal. For the reason that the consistent of government nowadays is by groups of people, and how the society work is not as simple as it was before. Therefore, establishing a good policy can't be simply contributed to a certain person. In fact, people are able to control the way they are willing to live in modern days by voting for specific policy or selecting candidates. As the reasons above, what we call as ""general welfare"" is too obscure because everyone has their own thought of good living and that affect people's own definition of the general welfare. \n Despite that the general welfare is too hard to define, you must say that the achievements of rulers, artists, scientists, specialists or people have tributes to the society, in a country are the best indicator of how great a nation is. I agree that those achievements are critical of demonstrating the prosperity of a country, while I don't think that people's welfare have much connection with it. \n Take a look at the people in North Korea, who are always considered suffering from bad living environment and a long term famine because of the lack of food and support from central authority. How come people can suffer from having no food in 21st century? Putting all these civil problems aside, their athletes are famous for well trained and always can get medals on most of internationally sports competition they attend. Moreover, they are pioneers of nuclear weapons. Their actual achievements in nuclear knowledge are unknown, but the fact that they are a treat to the world's leader, USA, is apparent. However, there are still many people escape from North Korea every years despite all the achievements mentioned above. \n Not only North Korea but China has achieved a lots to some degree in both science and art fields. However, their general living standard is evidently quite different from their performance level in those professional fields. In conclusion, neither general welfare nor the achievements from whichever fields are proper to be the only indicator of how good a nation is, and I believe that it should be scaled by not only specific factors but more comprehensive and various ones.","Dear student, somehow, I feel like you only posted the topic for discussion in the GRE essay. You did not post the discussion instruction along with it. Without the discussion instruction, it becomes difficult to review your work for relevance and appropriateness with regards to the discussion. As it is, the essay that you wrote is most likely going to score no higher than a 3. Since the actual purpose of the discussion is not clearly outlined in your opening statement, neither is it made clearer in the bodies of paragraphs that you wrote, I am not convinced that this is a very good or strong essay. The use of North Korea as an example in this essay is out of place. The discussion should be based on general, not political terms. You discussed the situation in a political context without taking more serious and far more relevant considerations into the discussion presentation. The example you used is of questionable importance and as such, weakened the presentation of your argument. Next time, post the prompt with the discussion instruction. That way a more thorough review of your essay can be provided. At this point, I can only assess your essay based on certain, obvious parameters.","The essay dives into a fascinating comparison between historical leadership and modern governance and how these aspects influence a nation's greatness. It seeks to navigate through complex themes such as general welfare, achievements in various fields, and their relative importance in assessing a nation's status. The argument is developed through examples and comparisons, showing a good level of understanding of the subject matter. However, there are areas that would benefit from further attention and improvement to ensure clarity, relevance, and impact.

1. **Relevance and Clarity of the Argument**: It's crucial to start with a clear thesis statement that outlines the topic and your stance. The essay somewhat lacks a clear linkage to the specific topic or question at hand. It's recommended to explicitly state your main argument in your introduction and ensure each paragraph contributes directly to supporting this argument. This will help your reader understand your position and follow your line of reasoning more easily.

2. **Use of Examples**: While examples are used to support arguments, their selection and context require careful consideration. Avoid choosing examples that might be seen as politically charged or controversial unless they directly support the essay's main argument, and ensure they are relevant and contribute to the discussion in a meaningful way. Consider examples that are universally applicable and non-political to strengthen your argument, focusing on how they illustrate your point rather than distract or divert from it.

3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that hinder the readability of the essay. For instance, ""a so called 'great' emperor"" could be rephrased as ""what is often called a 'great' emperor."" Also, pay attention to spelling and consistency (e.g., ""treat"" should be ""threat""). Aim for clear and concise sentences. This will make your arguments more persuasive and your essay easier to follow.

4. **Point of View and Arguments**: Your point of view does emerge, suggesting that a nation's greatness should not be judged solely by general welfare or achievements in specific fields but through a more comprehensive set of factors. However, this stance can be made clearer and more compelling with a structured argument. Make sure every paragraph has a clear main idea that supports your thesis, and use evidence and examples to back up each point you make.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should succinctly summarize the main arguments presented and reinforce why your viewpoint is valid. It's an opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the reader. Consider revisiting your conclusion to ensure it encapsulates the essence of your argument and the evidence you've presented in a powerful and memorable way.

In developing future essays, focusing on these areas of improvement will not only enhance the quality of writing but also the effectiveness of communication.

IELTS,"Foreign languages knowledge \n Question: \n Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or to work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. \n Answer: \n In modern times there are many courses and schools for learning a foreign language such as English, Spanish, French, Russian. The most common reason for studying a foreign language is because you are going to work or to travel in a particular country. But nowadays people start learning a different language not only for this but also because they want to enrich their culture and to communicate with more and more people. \n Firstly, travelling and working in a foreign country without knowing the native language is one of the most difficult things. For instance if I am going to work in some German company I will be obliged to learn Germany because without knowing it I will not be able to communicate with the other people if they don't know English for example. But in our everyday life not many people can separate time and money for studying language just for pleasure and this is one of the reasons why people learn a foreign language when it's necessary. \n Secondly, there are many people who just learn a foreign language because it is a pleasure for them to know more about the country or the people who live there. There are so many websites that you can communicate with people all over the world and to exchange information about the life in the different areas of the world. For example I have a friend whose favorite country is Japan. She is so attached to it that she started to learn the language because she wanted to find more about their culture and to communicate with Japanese people. \n All in all, no matter what you work or where you live knowing and studying a foreign language always will be an advantage for you because you will be able to find work easier, to communicate with different people and to enrich you knowledges.","Plamena, you have presented the discussion topic in the original prompt, but you failed to provide me with a copy of the discussion instruction.

As it is, your opening paraphrase seems to be missing some major required elements. I just can't put my finger on what those missing or improper portions are because of the less than complete prompt that you provided. Please remember to post the complete original prompt, with the discussion instructions included the next time around. For now, you will get a general review for this essay. \n Do not start any sentence with the word ""but"". ""But"" connotes that there is a previous idea that you would like to continue discussing in the same sentence. Since you were presenting a new sentence, you cannot use a connecting word at the start. Your vocabulary skills can use improvement. Remember, the language is German and the country is Germany. You should learn German (the language), not Germany (the country). \n Your concluding paragraph did not do you any favors either. You continued to discuss additional information in relation to the previous discussion. That is not the information that should be located in the concluding paragraph. The concluding paragraph should only present a quick run down of the aforementioned topic and reasons (not) supporting the discussion. Any additional information should be located in a separate paragraph before the conclusion. Since you only have a 5 paragraph maximum requirement, you should avoid presenting additional ideas in the concluding paragraph.","The essay begins by acknowledging the prompt's discussion topic, focusing on the reasons behind learning a foreign language. However, there's an unclear connection to specific instructions or expectations set by the prompt, which makes it difficult to fully assess if all required elements were addressed. For future submissions, ensuring the inclusion of the complete prompt, including any specific discussion instructions, would greatly help in providing more tailored and constructive feedback.

A key point to improve upon in the essay is the structuring of sentences, especially with the use of conjunctions like ""but."" Starting sentences with ""but"" suggests a continuation of a previous idea within the same sentence, and it is generally advisable to avoid beginning sentences with conjunctions in formal writing. Introducing new ideas or contrasting points can be done more effectively with a variety of sentence structures and transitional phrases that better connect thoughts and sections.

Regarding vocabulary and language accuracy, it's important to be precise. For example, when referring to languages and countries, use the correct terms such as ""German"" for the language and ""Germany"" for the country. This accuracy not only avoids confusion but also demonstrates a better command of the language being written in.

The conclusion of the essay would benefit from a more focused summary of the key points discussed without introducing new information. The purpose of a concluding paragraph is to encapsulate the main arguments presented, reinforcing the author's position on the topic. Adding new details in the conclusion can distract from the cohesiveness of the argument. It might be more effective to include any additional supporting information in the body paragraphs where it directly relates to the specific points being made.

Overall, the essay does a commendable job of presenting arguments for learning a foreign language beyond just work or travel. To enhance this further, clearer and more descriptive examples, along with a focused structure that carefully separates and elaborates on each point, would make the argument stronger. Attention to grammatical accuracy, precise vocabulary, and structured argumentation can greatly improve the overall clarity and impact of the essay.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

I find myself in complete agreement with this viewpoint. \n The first argument given to support my opinion is that poor countries remain poor due to several factors whether there is monetary support or not. I consider less wealthy countries can utilize money to address some problems but it can not attain the sustainable development, just assisting the citizens with resolving short-term issues. That is because corruption is one of the key road block to growth, weakening the economic potential and prosperity. Individuals who reach a level of financial wealth and a certain degree of status exploit their power to benefit themselves regardless of engaging illegal acts. Therefore there is no point in being supplied with a financial aid, the money can not reach the right recipients, who are unfortunate people living on the breadline. Furthermore, poverty also stems from the poor management of government and administrative systems of that nation and no countries have the right to intefere with its internal affairs. As a result, monetary support is not the solely measure to eliminate poverty. \n Another rationale behind my belief is that nations with a thriving economy should invest in education to assist their poorer counterparts with alleviating poverty to a certain amount. Children equipped with fundamental knowledge, numeracy and literacy skills will have the potential to get better employment, as well as higher income, greatly contributing to economic development. On the contrary, people with no post-secondary education can earn lower wages or even fall into unemployment. Hence, rich countries need to increase investment in the quality of primary schooling, create access to school in remote areas, making sure that education is available to children living in fragile contexts. As a result, with good education system, poor countries will achieve sustained economic growth in the foreseeable future. \n In conclusion, I believe rather than giving direct financial aid, developed nations should supply other forms of long-term assistance such as education to help the less wealthy countries eradicate poverty.","You forgot to keep track of your word count.

This strong stance, rooted in your personal viewpoint, elevates the overall argument of the essay. However, there are several areas where improvements could be made to enhance your essay further.

1. **Responsiveness to the Topic:**
You've successfully aligned your essay with the given topic by arguing that non-financial aid, particularly in education, may be more beneficial for poorer countries. This focus is commendable as it demonstrates a clear understanding of the task.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
While your essay is largely free of spelling mistakes, there are a few grammatical and stylistic issues that hinder its readability. For example, some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to understand. Simplifying these sentences and enhancing clarity should be a priority. Consider breaking down complex ideas into shorter sentences to improve coherence. Additionally, watch out for typos like ""intefere"" which should be ""interfere"", and be mindful of proper punctuation usage to separate ideas clearly.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
Your stance is clear throughout the essay, which is a strong point. However, the effectiveness of conveying this viewpoint can be hampered by convoluted reasoning in some paragraphs. Strive for clarity by directly linking your arguments back to your main point of view at every opportunity. This will strengthen the impact of your position on the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
You've provided relevant examples to back your viewpoint, especially highlighting the impact of education on economic development. Nevertheless, elaborating on these arguments with more concrete examples or data could further bolster your case. Avoid overgeneralizing and aim to provide specific, detailed reasons that directly support your stance. 

**Additional Insight:**
Be mindful of the essay's length. While there's no strict word limit, keeping your essay concise (suggested under 300 words) allows you to focus more on the quality of your arguments rather than their quantity. A shorter essay encourages you to express your ideas more clearly and directly, which can help in avoiding errors and improving the overall coherence and cohesion of your writing.

In summary, you've demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic with a clear and pertinent viewpoint. Focusing on simplifying your language, clarifying your arguments, and being concise will significantly improve your essay.

In my opinion, the mentioned trend brings more drawbacks than benefits. \n First of all, working just has few cons for the old residents. It will help them have more income to have better living conditions. Some people do not work anymore when they enter the age of retirement, so they have to depend on the money of their children or the government to live. However, sometimes, that money is not enough which means that if they can go to work, it will be huge support not only for themselves but also for their families. It can help them to avoid becoming the financial burden of their child, which will make the old feel much happier to not disturb them. \n On the other hand, this trend has many disadvantages. Firstly, to compare with the young working force, the elder's productivity is not high. The older people become, the weaker they will be. For example, a factory employs 100 workers consisting of 60 high-aged workers, the slow movement of them may delay the productivity of the whole team. Secondly, there are too many mental risks to let the elderly work. As they get weaker over time, they will also have a higher rate of experiencing lots of sicknesses like bone tissue or the cold, even COVID-19. Last but not least, the working force of a nation has its own limit. If the old continue working at any age, the young adult may lose their opportunities of being employed or getting a well-paid job.

The attempt to weigh both positives and negatives demonstrates a well-considered view. However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and directness in addressing the essay topic. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay seems to fluctuate between discussing the advantages and disadvantages of elderly employment ambiguously. It's essential to affirm whether you're discussing it as an advantage or a disadvantage right from the start, using the original keywords given in the prompt. This will make your position clear to the reader.

2. **Clear Argumentation**: Your introduction of points could be more clearly structured. When stating your opinion, directly support it with two reasoned arguments right away. This will strengthen your essay by directly correlating your opinion with evidence or examples, making your viewpoint more convincing.

3. **Relevance to the Topic**: The paragraph suggesting that working has few cons for older people deviates from the focus. It would be more beneficial to concentrate on how the topic directly impacts the workforce and workplace, ensuring all your points are closely tied to the central theme of the essay.

4. **Development of Ideas**: The essay mentions significant disadvantages, which if developed and presented individually with detailed paragraphs, would greatly enhance the reader's understanding and improve the essay’s persuasiveness. Each point mentioned could be explored in more depth.

5. **Clarity and Coherence**: Phrases like ""both cons and pros"" diverge from the expected response format and can cause confusion. Staying aligned with a clear thesis throughout will avoid potential deductions and maintain a focused argument.

6. **Stylistic and Grammatical Issues**: While the essay generally conveys your points, closer attention to grammar, punctuation, and variation in sentence structure would increase readability and professionalism. Minor errors can detract from the essay’s overall impact.

7. **Clarifying the Conclusion**: Your concluding statement reiterates the presence of both advantages and disadvantages but lacks a reversed paraphrase which could have reinforced your position effectively.

The stance against limiting help to one's own country is clear and is supported by the argument that collective action can have a global impact.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Ensure the essay closely adheres to the given prompt. It appears that the essay might have drifted from the specific requirements of the prompt. Instead of broad statements, it's crucial to understand and directly address the essay prompt's question. This helps in keeping the discussion focused and increases the accuracy of your response.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: The essay contains minor spelling and grammar issues that can distract readers. For example, ""every problems"" should be ""every problem,"" and in places, the essay could benefit from better punctuation. Using simpler sentences could help in making your arguments clearer and easier to follow.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While the essay's point of view is generally clear, it would strengthen your position to explicitly outline your reasons for disagreeing with the notion of not helping others due to domestic issues. A more structured approach, where each paragraph delves into a distinct reason or example supporting your view, can enhance clarity.

4. **Arguments and Examples**: The essay provides examples such as Nelson Mandela's efforts against apartheid. However, it's important to accurately represent historical figures and facts. Mandela, for example, primarily focused on South Africa's issues. While he later became a global symbol of peace, his main contributions were within his country. Ensuring that examples accurately support your argument avoids weakening your position.

Improvements to consider:
- **Revisit the Essay Prompt**: Make sure you fully understand the prompt and stick closely to its requirements throughout your essay. This involves not only disagreeing or agreeing but examining to what extent and why, which nuances your argument.
- **Accuracy in Examples**: When using historical examples, ensure they accurately support your argument and are relevant to the essay's topic.
- **Simplification and Clarity**: Simplifying complex sentences and ensuring grammatical accuracy can greatly enhance the readability of your essay.
- **Structured Argumentation**: Structure your essay so that each paragraph introduces and explores a single argument or example. This clarity helps the reader follow your line of reasoning more effectively.

Markdown #4. \n The essay might recieve a very low passing score due to the significant errors presented. Incorrect interpretations and missing paragraphs are its main issues.","Your essay addresses an interesting perspective on whether talent in sports or music is innate or can be developed through practice. However, there are several areas where improvements can help clarify your arguments and better align your essay with the topic. Let's go through them step by step.

1. **Understanding and Responding to the Topic**:
   Your essay seems to misunderstand the core of the topic. The debate is not primarily about whether everyone has different talents but whether talent in sports or music is something one is born with or can achieve through hard work. Focusing your essay more directly on this question would make your argument stronger and more relevant.

2. **Clarity and Development of Arguments**:
   You’ve included discussions that are generally on the right track by mentioning cultural differences in how talent is perceived and cultivated. These points are well-developed when discussing public opinions in different cultures. However, the essay lacks a clear personal standpoint. Including a paragraph where you directly express your own opinion on whether talent can be nurtured or is innate would make your argument more comprehensive and engaging.

3. **Grammar, Style, and Writing Mechanics**:
   The essay has minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that can be refined for better clarity and flow. Phrases like ""everyone has his or her talent in a different thing"" could be more concisely phrased as ""everyone has different talents."" Additionally, consider varying sentence structures to enhance readability and engagement.

4. **Conclusion Strength and Length**:
   Your concluding paragraph falls short of fully summarizing your points and reaffirming your stance. It also does not meet the expected length of at least 40 words and two sentences. Expanding your conclusion to clearly state your view, while summarizing the main points discussed, would better wrap up your essay.

5. **Specific Feedback for Improvement**:
   - Revisit the essay topic and adjust your thesis to directly address whether sports and music talents are innate or developed through practice.
   - Add a paragraph expressing your personal viewpoint on the issue, explaining why you hold this view with clear examples or reasoning.
   - Work on refining your grammar and style for clarity and engagement. Tools like grammar checkers or reading your essay aloud might help.
   - Ensure your conclusion effectively encapsulates your discussion and clearly states your position, making sure it meets the length requirements.

This essay has a strong starting point with interesting cultural insights. With focused revisions on understanding the topic, clearer argumentation, and refined writing mechanics, your essay has the potential to provide a compelling discussion on the nature of talent in sports and music.",3,4,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Conversely, it keeps the people apart from social relationship. I am convinced that the internet is an essential tool in modern life. \n First, the wild world web notably impacts on both education and social life. For example, using an email at school, universities, which is a way to contact between students and teachers. Students use this method of communication to send homework. Besides that, teachers use it to broadcast materials or any other things for their students. Similarly, in the business world, companies use the internet to build relationships with customers and other organisations. \n Secondly, the benefits of social media, networking over the internet, outweigh the drawbacks. It is evident that these websites help people to make new friends as well as keep in touch with their family whether they are near or far in the distance . in another word, they make the life more comfortable and convenient. \n Finally, the internet increases the opportunities for work and education in other countries. A good illustration of that, when we are looking for scholarships to complete higher education, smoothly we go to the internet and type on google what we want. Then, it brings all the available positions to us, and we can choose. Another example, when we are looking for a job, we do not need to go out and visit all the companies in the city. The only thing we do is subscribing the job websites on social media such as pages on Facebook, Instagram, Tweeter, and so on. \n To summerise, I can't entirely agree with this; the internet has numerous advantages and the disadvantage of it we can control by ourselves.","The complete prompt for this essay indicates that requires a clear degree of dis/agreement with the given topic. As such, your introduction paragraph does not clearly indicate a response to the thesis statement. You cannot simply ""be convinced"". Rather, you have to indicate if you totally or partially agree with the given statement. That means the response should have been and emotional response such as ""I totally dis/agree"", ""I partially dis/agree"", ""I strongly dis/agree"" and the like.

Which I believe would fall around the 5 band overall.","The essay addresses the significant role of the internet in modern life, focusing on its impact on education, social life, and job and education opportunities. However, in order to make this essay stronger and more aligned with English proficiency test standards, several aspects need improvement.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The introduction does not clearly state your position in response to the prompt. To improve, clearly express your agreement or disagreement with the stated topic right from the start. Use phrases like ""I strongly agree/disagree"" to make your stance unmistakable. This clarity is crucial for the essay's effectiveness and is expected in English proficiency tests.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay contains a few errors that need correction. For instance, ""wild world web"" should be corrected to ""World Wide Web"". Pay attention to capitalization and punctuation, such as the consistent use of proper nouns (""Google,"" ""Facebook,"" ""Instagram,"" ""Twitter"") and ensuring sentences begin with a capital letter. Furthermore, avoid run-on sentences by properly separating ideas into distinct sentences or using conjunctions effectively.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: While the essay suggests a positive view of the internet, this viewpoint needs to be stated more explicitly throughout the essay, not just at the end. Ensure each paragraph supports your clear stance regarding the internet's role in modern life.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay presents arguments related to education, social life, and global opportunities. To enhance these arguments, include more specific examples and possibly statistics or studies that support your viewpoints. This will make the essay more persuasive and impactful.

Additionally, consider the following specific suggestions for improvement:

- In the conclusion, instead of saying ""I can't entirely agree with this,"" clarify what exactly is being disagreed with and summarize your main points to reinforce your position.

- Use transitions between paragraphs more effectively to create a smooth flow. Phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""Secondly,"" and ""Finally"" help, but ensure the content within each section leads logically to the next.

- To avoid misunderstandings, double-check the use of specific terms related to social media and the internet, ensuring they are used correctly.

- The inclusion of personal experiences or more detailed examples would make the arguments more relatable and compelling.

By addressing these points, the essay can be significantly improved in structure, clarity, and coherence, making it more effective in conveying the author's perspective and more likely to achieve a higher score on English proficiency tests.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Cars grant owners convenience, and also provide ready access to a variety of services and leisure options. Nevertheless, there is still a range of problems that should be identified and addressed. \n There are innumerable drawbacks caused by this means of transportation, but one evident minus point is the environmental costs that frequent car use brings about. Vehicles have long been reported as a major cause of air pollution due to the released toxic fumes. The more cars traveling on the roads, the more emission being exhausted, leading to a severely polluted atmosphere. The noise from cars' horns is also an indisputable reason for the increase in noise pollution, especially in urban areas. Not only does the environment have to suffer but also the human's safety. Numerous casualties have been recorded annually resulting from car accidents. \n Therefore, it is a must to tackle these issues, and some people support that a strict restriction on the use of cars should be imposed. However, it's not the best option at the time, especially when the need for flexibility is rising high and the car industry's role in a country's economy is becoming dominant. To alleviate the environmentally related impacts, encouraging citizens to travel by public means of transportation (bikes, buses...) or promoting environmentally-friendly cars which run on solar power should be taken into consideration. Another practical solution is to expand and enhance transport infrastructures to reduce the traffic jams and accidents. \n To encapsulate, the regular use of cars does result in many problems related to not only the environment but also humanity. Despite the seemingly positive effects of limiting people's car use, it is unfortunately not a permanent cure. Immediate actions should be taken with the view to avoiding severe consequences.","The prompt restatement is not even remotely related to the original discussion. The questions being asked as the establishing platform for the writer's opinion were also not addressed directly with topical responses in the first paragraph. The opening statement is a failure in terms of responding to the task. The first paragraph has one objective alone, to do a simple rewording of the original topic, then respond directly to the questions within 2 sentences that will establish the succeeding discussion paragraphs. When the writer does not address the concerns of the paragraph properly, he is said to not have met task accuracy requirements. This is an example of an empty restatement. It neither meets the topic paraphrasing nor the opinion response needs to meet receive a decent accuracy score. Stick to the script in the first paragraph. \n The author has incorrectly used a possessive apostrophe in this case. Nobody owns the cars in terms of reference. It is just a general description of the object. There is no need for an apostrophe at the end of the plural form of the word (cars not cars'). The paragraph should not have had a 3rd reason presented. The most one should present in these paragraphs are 2 connected reasons (air and noise pollution) that can share the same reasoning. The last reason was not properly connected nor explained anymore. It affected the cohesiveness of the paragraph negatively. \n The writer should provide a direct response to the given question ""Should people be discouraged to use cars?"" The paragraph should kick off with a clear opinion sentence such as ""I believe that people should not be discouraged to use cars at this point."" Then proceed to explain 2 related reasons for this belief. There is no sense in unnecessarily making the paragraph longer since longer does not always mean better. It is the author's logic and intelligence, not the words written that is being assessed here. Long essays usually mean more mistakes or irrelevant discussion points.","Your essay addresses the important topic of the impacts of car usage on society and the environment, which is relevant and engaging. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing.

1. **Topic Response**: Your introduction needs more focus to clearly address the essay question directly. It's essential to restate the topic accurately and then provide a straightforward answer or stance in the first paragraph. This approach not only sets a strong foundation for your arguments but also ensures you meet the task's requirements effectively. 

2. **Grammar and Style**: Pay attention to the use of possessive apostrophes. For example, when discussing cars in general, there's no need for an apostrophe; it should simply be ""cars"" not ""cars'."" Additionally, aim for clarity and conciseness in your writing. Try to avoid overly complex sentences that might confuse the reader or detract from your main points.

3. **Clear Point of View**: You should start your discussion sections with a clear statement of your viewpoint regarding the use of cars. For instance, if your essay aims to argue against discouraging the use of cars, begin with a sentence that reflects this position explicitly. This will make your argument more coherent and easier for the reader to follow.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you have provided a range of arguments, focusing on a couple of related points might enable you to explore these ideas more thoroughly and convincingly. In places, the essay attempts to cover too many points at once, which can dilute the overall impact of your argument. For stronger coherence, limit the main ideas you discuss and delve deeper into each. 

5. **Essay Structure**: Ensure each paragraph serves a clear purpose in supporting your main argument. The introduction should set up the essay and directly address the question. Each body paragraph should then tackle a specific aspect of your argument with clear explanations and examples. The conclusion should summarize your points and reiterate your stance convincingly.

6. **Cohesiveness**: It's crucial to maintain a logical flow throughout your essay. Each paragraph should seamlessly lead to the next, with each argument building upon the previous one. This can be achieved by more effectively connecting your points and ensuring that all parts of your essay work together towards supporting your main thesis.

By refining these aspects of your essay, you can create a more compelling and well-structured argument.

In my opinion, I completely disagree with this view. \n On the one hand, the natural health of adolescents is inferior to that of adults. The reason is that their bodies are not wholly developed biologically as well as having to eat meals without essential nutrients in prison, which leads to a lack of sources of nourishment for the normal development of individuals. Moreover, when teenagers have to work at the same intensity as adults making them disabled. As a result, the young suffer from illness, emaciation, and even death. Thus, equal punishment has proven its harmful effects and changed the natural growth of a person. \n On the other hand, the mind and mental health of immature people is not fully grown. In other words, they are not capable of being aware of their own behavior and the consequence of their own acts. This is the reason why all countries have a special court for young offenders called juvenile court. Furthermore, in sessions of this court where parents or legal guardians of teenagers who take part in illegal acts ought to present. Hence, there are different convictions that are utilized depending on the level of the cognitive process of statutory age. \n In conclusion, although many people think that criminals of all age groups should be treated in an identical manner, I personally disagree with this statement due to the difference in physical and mental completion between adults and adolescents.","This essay will only be partially scored due to the reasoning error of the writer. Since this is an extent essay, the discussion approach must be based on the reasons that support the writer's opinion alone. He has to convince the reader of the extent by which his reasoning is correct when it comes to this discussion. That means, he must approach the essay in a debate format that is indicative of why the extent of the public opinion is incorrect. He has to present an opposing side, then explain why that is wrong. For example he could say: \n <em>While I do agree that... I have to strongly disagree when they say that this is the only way to treat juvenile crime. Another way of dealing with the crime is by...<br/><br/>Although there is sense to the reason that... I heavily oppose this because...</em> \n See the difference? There is a clear measured response that shows the clear weakness of the other discussion. So the writer's opinion needs to clearly state this by saying: \n <em>I am completely opposed to this view due to the reasons that include (1) and (2).</em> \n By explaining the short form reasons in a measured response format, the writer will create a wholly supportive single point of view essay that adheres to his personal reasoning. In this case, only the reason that supports the opinion will get a score so the essay might fail the test due to lack of reasoning development. He cannot oppose his own opinion in the presentation by giving reasons as to why both reasons could be correct. Only the correctness of his measured opinion is what matters here.","The essay attempts to address the prompt by arguing against treating young offenders the same as adults. The clear stance is that adolescents should not receive equal punishments as adults because of their underdeveloped physical and mental states. This is a strong and relevant point of view in response to the topic. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the essay's effectiveness and coherence.

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay does present an opinion, it could be strengthened by explicitly stating reasons supporting this view right from the introduction. For instance, summarize the key points by saying: ""I completely disagree with this view because of the significant physical and mental development differences between adults and adolescents, which make equal punishment inappropriate.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are no significant spelling mistakes, but there are several grammatical and stylistic issues that hinder clarity. The use of phrases like ""the natural health of adolescents is inferior"" could be clearer. A simpler and more direct way to express this idea would be: ""Adolescents are not as physically developed as adults."" Aim for simpler language that conveys points more directly, which is particularly effective for English language learners. Additionally, sentences are sometimes long and complex, making them difficult to follow. Breaking them down into shorter, more concise sentences could improve readability.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The point of view is generally clear, but the essay would benefit from a more structured argument that explicitly contrasts the author's stance with the opposing view, then details why the opposing view is flawed. This structure helps to reinforce the author's position by directly addressing and refuting the counterarguments.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The arguments provided, focusing on physical and mental underdevelopment, are relevant but need to be more specific and detailed. For each point made, include evidence or examples to support the claim. Additionally, introducing counterarguments and explaining why they are not convincing can strengthen the essay. For example, after presenting the opposing view that young offenders should be treated as adults, counter it by saying, ""This view overlooks crucial differences in cognitive development that justify distinct treatment in the justice system.""

In summary, the essay proposes a valuable perspective but needs to refine its argument structure, simplify language for clarity, and provide more specific evidence to support claims. Directly addressing the opposing viewpoint with counterarguments will also enhance the argument's persuasiveness and depth. By making these adjustments, the essay will offer a more compelling and comprehensive examination of the issue.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

I feel this way for several reasons, which I will explore in the following essay. \n To begin with, history of music starts from the folk music and it is the root of any culture. The subject would introduce me interesting facts about development music from ancient times till present day and it is great not only to read about it, but to listen to melodies too. During my trip to India and Turkey I had visited incredible museums of different eras of oriental cultural history and there were informative lectures in exhibition halls which were accompanied by folk music. It had great impact on visitors including me. I am passionate about both history and music and I would study the history of world music with pleasure. \n Furthermore, attending the history of music class, I would enrich my knowledge on other cultures of the world. There are so many fascinating places, nations and cultures, which are still not studied well. As every culture has it own music and history, I would study them and present my knowledge and research results to the world. For instance, the culture of my country.

We have so many outstanding composers and musicians, whom should know everyone in the world. If there were more people interested on the history of music or culture, kyrgyz culture would be familiar to more people. \n In conclusion, if I decide to study some subject which had never studied, I will choose the History of Music.

This choice is clearly stated and explored through the essay with specific reasons and examples. However, improvements can be made in several areas to enhance the quality and clarity of the writing.

Firstly, it's important to manage the time spent on writing and revising the essay. While the time allowance is 30 minutes, not all of it should be used for writing alone. Aim to spend no more than 20 minutes drafting the essay, leaving the remaining 10 minutes to review and polish your work. This approach will help in identifying and correcting errors that could lower the overall score.

In terms of structure, the introduction could be strengthened. Avoid using filler sentences such as ""I feel this way for several reasons, which I will explore in the following essay."" Instead, dive directly into your main arguments or provide a thesis statement if applicable. This ensures a stronger and more direct opening that engages the reader right away.

Regarding content, while the personal experiences and interest in music and history are well-noted, some parts of the essay diverge from the central theme of the History of Music. Ensure that every example and detail directly supports your main point. For instance, rather than briefly mentioning the impact of folk music in museums, expand on how these experiences specifically deepened your interest in historical and traditional music. This helps maintain focus and enriches your argument.

There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. These include the consistent spelling of ""history of music"" (consider capitalizing as ""History of Music"" when referring to the subject of study), and some sentences that could be clearer or more concise.

Additionally, the point of view is generally clear, but could be made even more so by directly tying personal experiences and general observations back to the main argument more explicitly. 

The argument would also benefit from more detailed examples or explanations of how studying the History of Music would not only enrich personal understanding but also contribute to wider cultural appreciation globally. Mentioning the desire to share knowledge about Kyrgyzstan’s music and culture is an excellent start; consider expanding on what specific aspects of these you find most compelling and how they could be of interest to others.

I could contend that the broadcasts today are developed their content that attracts and responds to acquisitions and demands of the audiences in all aspects, delivering news reports to the public transiently. \n From my perspective, it would be wrong to refuse the integral role of broadcasts in connecting audiences with news and facts.

Take the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, during the period of social isolation, people who continuously pay attention to this dangerous disease by following and updating day-by-day information about the fatality, the positive cases, and new exposure-related zones can protect themselves from its contagion. In contrast, residents who outlook this news were vulnerable to this infectious disease. \n In my opinion, news and TV programs are not only means of updating happenings, but also the governments can utilize this kind of social transmission to inform and spread laws, and national policies throughout their countries.

For example, medical warnings, state settlements, and grant support are deployed and negotiated to citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, so they can expand their understanding and obey the treatment and isolated rules. \n In conclusion, I believe that spending time and money on all kinds of news and TV programs is worthwhile and necessary to contribute to promoting quality of life.","The main score reduction will occur in this essay not due to the irrelevancy of the discussion because the reasoning paragraphs are on track, but from the way that the response format does not deliver the expected answer foundation.

However, to improve your essay and fully meet the task requirements, consider the following points based on the aspects you've asked about:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The prompt asks for a measured response to a specific question: ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?"" While your essay implies disagreement with the statement that news is irrelevant, it does not explicitly state your position. For a stronger response, begin with a clear thesis statement that directly addresses this question. For example, ""I strongly disagree with the notion that news is irrelevant to people's lives, as it plays a crucial role in keeping the public informed and engaged with global events.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** Your essay has a solid foundation, but it could benefit from clearer and more direct sentence structures. Avoid run-on sentences and fragmented ideas, as they can confuse the reader. Each paragraph should have a clear main idea, supported by specific examples. Watch for subject-verb agreement and aim for sentence variety to keep your writing engaging. Additionally, the term ""broadcasts"" was used to describe content, but it might be clearer to say ""news broadcasts"" or ""news programs"" to avoid ambiguity.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** Your viewpoint becomes evident throughout the essay, but initially, it's not explicitly stated. Make your stance clear from the beginning and use the body paragraphs to reinforce this perspective with evidence and examples.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** Your essay provides examples, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to argue the importance of news. This is a good strategy. To strengthen your arguments further, ensure each example directly supports your thesis. Explain how each example shows the relevance of news to people's lives. Additionally, consider addressing potential counterarguments to show a comprehensive understanding of the topic. For instance, acknowledge why some may view news as irrelevant and then refute those points.

In conclusion, focusing on expressing a clear stance in direct response to the essay question, structuring your sentences more clearly, and providing detailed examples that closely support your argument will substantially improve your essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay addresses the topic, but sometimes your points get lost because of grammatical errors and unclear expressions. To strengthen your essay, focus on directly answering the question and ensuring each paragraph has a clear main idea that relates to the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are significant spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay which disrupt the flow and make it hard for readers to follow your ideas. For example, ""texnology"" should be ""technology,"" ""maded"" should be ""made,"" and ""actifities"" should be ""activities."" Also, pay attention to plural and singular nouns, verb tenses, and sentence structure. Using a word processor with spelling and grammar checks can help identify and correct these errors. Improving your spelling and grammar is crucial for making your essay more readable and professional.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** While your stance on the importance of the internet is clear, the delivery sometimes lacks clarity due to the errors mentioned. Practicing writing clear and concise sentences can help convey your point of view more effectively. Before submitting your essay, it might be beneficial to read it out loud or have someone else read it to ensure the ideas are communicated clearly.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** Your essay lists benefits of the internet but often doesn't provide detailed explanations or examples to support these claims. To strengthen your arguments, consider adding specific examples and explaining how each advantage impacts society or individuals. This will make your essay more persuasive and engaging.

Improvement Suggestions:
- **Revise for Spelling and Grammar:** Carefully review your essay for spelling and grammatical mistakes. Using online tools or word processors can help identify and correct these issues.
- **Expand Your Arguments:** Provide more details and examples for each advantage of the internet you mention. This will make your arguments stronger and more convincing.
- **Focus on Clarity:** Make sure each sentence clearly expresses an idea. Keep sentences simple and direct to improve readability.
- **Practice Regularly:** Regular writing practice can help improve your grammar and spelling. Consider reading more in English to see examples of correct usage and expand your vocabulary.

Overall, you've made a good attempt to discuss the advantages of the internet. By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can greatly enhance the quality and effectiveness of your essay. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback on your progress.",2,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Informative

While I believe that some ideas are outdated, I agree that other values should not be forgotten. \n There are some values which I believe are incompatible to this modern life. Firstly, the concept of when to marry or the rules of who we can get married to are changing. People thesedays often choose their partner with their own criteria and decide whether or not it is the right time to get married depend on different circumstances, such as work, feelings or readiness. Furthermore, the belief that we need to have a job for life is no longer normal. People have chosen to do many different things in order to choose which one is good for them. \n Despite several outdated ideas of life, there are plenty of good traits from traditional values. For examples, older generations have made a huge impact on working hard, always do one's best and take pride in one's work. These could benefit younger generations as they enter nowadays competitive world. Furthermore, some of the characteristics which are often seen as traditional such as politeness, humbleness or respect should be kept as youngsters are encountering many people from different backgrounds. Finally, I believe that younger generations could be happier if they live in an area where people can look after each other. \n In conclusion, traditional values have its drawbacks but I believe there are also several good things to be kept.","Let me stop you right there, t the prompt paraphrase. Your total essay missed the mark because of that presentation. Your paraphrase was incorrect, you did not respond to the given question, you did not meet the minimum sentence count for the paragraph... These are but a few of the errors that kicked off the start of your incorrect essay. \n For starters, you were not asked if the opinion previously provided was incorrect or not. Therefore, you should not have framed the sentence to start with ""It is true"" because that was not the point of the discussion topic. Next, you were asked about the measurement of your dis/agreement with the given opinion. Rather than picking a side to represent, you decided to change the discussion instruction to a comparative essay presentation by saying; "" While I believe some ideas... I agree that...."" That is non-opinion presentation. You did not clearly indicate the strength of your single opinion based on the agree or disagree format. The essay does not have a clear opinion presented, so you will lose points for not being able to make a decision or choose one of 2 given opinion discussion points. \n That has caused your essay to follow an unexpected discussion format, which led to the lack of clarity in your discussion presentation. You did not follow the discussion format as indicated in the original prompt so you will have a hard time achieving a passing score for the essay. Additionally, your concluding paragraph is only one sentence long. Since that is a reverse paraphrase, you should be presenting anywhere between 3-5 sentences, just like you should have done in the introduction paraphrase.","Your essay attempts to balance the value of traditional beliefs against the demands of modern life. However, there are several key areas where improvements are needed for a clearer, more effective argument in response to the essay topic.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The introduction of your essay suggests a misunderstanding of the original prompt. Instead of directly addressing whether you agree or disagree with a given opinion, you present both sides of the argument. This approach can confuse readers about your actual stance. For a stronger essay, clearly state your position right from the start. It's crucial to directly address the prompt and maintain a focused opinion throughout the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While your essay has a reasonable flow, there are some stylistic and grammatical inconsistencies that hinder clarity. Consider revising sentences that are overly complex or where the meaning is unclear due to grammar errors. Using simpler language can help make your points more accessible to the reader. Also, pay attention to spelling and ensure that you're using words correctly within the context.

3. **Clarity of Your Point of View**: Your essay's point of view becomes muddled due to the attempt to cover both sides of the argument without a decisive stance. Strengthening your essay involves committing to a perspective and building your arguments around that viewpoint. Your aim should be to persuade the reader of your position using clear, decisive language.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your discussion of outdated and valuable traditional beliefs provides a good starting point for your argument. However, these points need clearer examples and more detailed explanations to effectively support your view. For instance, when speaking about traditional values worth preserving, delve deeper into how these values specifically benefit the modern generation. By employing more concrete examples and elaborating on your points, you can offer a more compelling and persuasive argument.

Additionally, your conclusion should restate your main points and reflect on the significance of your argument, rather than offering a new thought or simply ending abruptly. Aim for a conclusion that synthesizes your previous arguments, reinforcing your position on the topic.

Remember, a good essay not only presents a clear stance on the topic but also supports this stance with well-articulated arguments and examples. Think about these aspects in your revisions, working towards a more focused and persuasive essay.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

In my opinion, I completely agree with this viewpoint because it can eliminate the cultural border. \n In terms of social life, having an insight into the customs and traditions of other countries makes it much easier for you to make new friends and expand your network. This means that foreigners can avoid unfortunate mistakes concerning customs and traditions. For example, in Vietnam, people commonly take a nap at midday, so a meeting with indigenious neighbors occurring right after lunch may be considered as an inconvenience for the locals if newcomers do not acknowledge this particularly unique custom. \n As regards career, assimilating into a new culture can generally improve your working life. This is all attributed to the fact that new employees can better manipulate their daily actions towards their colleagues and leaders, who play an integral role in both their promotional opportunities and working environment, to their advantage. Consequently, they will appear to be much more professional and respectful at work. Moreover, in some specific careers relating to customer service, complying with the customs and traditions possibly help them better understand their clients so that they can provide them with the best service possible and evade further irritating already angry and irate customers. \n In conclusion, customs and traditions of a new country should be obeyed because it can bridge the cultural gap, resulting in advantages in both social and working life. However, people should also avoid abandoning their original culture for every culture should be well preserved.","This is a well thought out and properly developed essay. The prompt restatement and writer's opinion came in strong and well represented. It delivered on all scoring consideration points and will be given a very impressive preliminary score. It is specially strong in representing the discussion basis for the writer's opinion. \n Both aspects discussed as consideration factors are valid and deliver clear supporting reasons for the writer's previously stated opinion. The writer understood that the correct discussion format for this type of question is a single opinion defense presentation. This understanding helped to create a very cohesive and coherent discussion presentation. The paragraphs relate to one another and highlight aspects of the discussion that prove the validity of the writer's way of thinking. \n A slight error occurred in the summary conclusion though. While the presentation presented a solid summary within 2 sentences, the 3rd sentence is what forced the closing statement error. The error was caused by the sudden reference to an unrelated discussion point which resulted in the introduction of a new topic. Such a reference created an open ended essay and a prompt deviation at the same time. Needless to say, the paragraph will receive point deductions because of this last sentence but it may not cause the essay to receive a failing score in the end. The good performance early in the presentation worked to prevent that from happening.","This essay effectively addresses the topic, presenting a well-developed argument in favor of newcomers adapting to the customs and traditions of their new countries. The clear statement of agreement with this view sets a strong foundation for the subsequent discussion. The structure and coherence of the essay are commendable, with each paragraph smoothly transitioning to the next, reinforcing the author's stance through well-chosen examples and considerations.

The essay excels in discussing the benefits of cultural adaptation in both social and professional contexts. The example of Vietnam’s midday nap tradition illustrates the potential for cultural misunderstandings and highlights the importance of awareness to foster social connections. Similarly, the discussion on career benefits associated with cultural assimilation underscores the advantage of being perceived as professional and respectful in the workplace. This focus on practical examples strengthens the argument and makes it more relatable to the reader.

However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved for clarity and impact. While spelling issues are minimal, attention to grammatical and stylistic aspects could enhance the overall readability. For instance, varying sentence structures and polishing transitions between ideas may help maintain the reader’s engagement throughout the essay.

The conclusion succinctly summarizes the main points but introduces a new concept towards the end, which slightly deviates from the essay’s focus. It’s essential to ensure that all elements introduced in the conclusion have been discussed earlier in the essay to avoid leaving the reader with unresolved questions. Reducing unnecessary complexity in language could also make the arguments more accessible, especially for English language learners.

To strengthen the point of view, it would be beneficial to integrate more differentiated perspectives and potentially address counterarguments. This approach would not only deepen the discussion but also showcase critical thinking skills. Explicit linking words could further clarify how each argument supports the author's viewpoint, making the essay's structure more apparent to the reader.

Finally, while the cultural integration theme is compelling, a more nuanced exploration of the balance between adapting to new customs and preserving one’s original culture might enrich the essay. This consideration would align with the ending remark and could be integrated more organically into the essay’s argumentative framework.

In summary, focusing on grammatical precision, avoiding the introduction of new concepts in the conclusion, and enhancing argumentative depth with counterpoints could elevate the essay's effectiveness. The solid foundation and coherent structure provide a strong basis for these improvements.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

While I accept that this seems a negative development, I personally believe that the benefits of the news media far outweighed its drawbacks. \n On the one hand, the news media would have an adverse effect on society. Firstly, in order to attract a large number of readers and gain more profit, the gutter press is likely to sensationalise stories which could mislead the public's opinion and distort readers' perception of reality. For instance, statistics and information of Corona virus without censorship these days, which is spread instantly in the internet, would instill a sense of fear in society and cause mistaken treatment. In addition, famous people are also the victim of invading their privacy by the paparazzi who are determined to get a story at any cost. As a result, celebrities who suffer from invasion of privacy tend to get depressed or even commit suicide. \n On the other hand, the influence of news media could create positive impact on general public. First of all, it would be news channels that keep people informed about what was going on in the world continuously. While reading broadsheets would get access to quality coverage of news and current affairs, being exposed to popular tabloids would widen human's mind about lively and colorful stories. What is more, the news media including good news could inspire followers with an optimistic life. For example, with people have been opposed to news of the disadvantaged in developing countries, it would instill a sense of satisfaction and respect of their life. \n In conclusion, it seems to me that the news media has positive effect on people's lives and it should be supported to grow orientedly.","Remember that people are divided on the issue of ""fake news"" these days. So you cannot say that something is an undeniable influence. There will be people who will disagree with you or deny such a claim. Avoid exaggerations in your restatements. Just stick to the information provided so that you do not accidentally over-do your presentation. Additionally, you should review the original discussion instructions when you finish drafting your essay. Never assume that you properly discussed the presentation without double checking the original source. As you can see, in your presentation, you changed the discussion slant of the presentation, thus creating a totally different prompt discussion, which would have led to your failing this test because your response is not related to the given question. \n Please take note of the following: \n <em>OT: SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE NEWS MEDIA NOWADAYS HAVE INFLUENCED PEOPLE'S LIVES IN NEGATIVE WAYS<br/>YT: It is undeniable that the news media has significant influence on the daily lives of human these days.</em> \n - Where is the negative influence statement? \n <em>DI: TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?<br/>R: While I accept that this seems a negative development, I personally believe that the benefits of the news media far outweighed its drawbacks.</em> \n - There is no given response to the question provided. \n You changed the original prompt from beginning to end.

However, there are several areas where improvements could be made to enhance clarity, accuracy, and adherence to the essay prompt. Here's some specific feedback:

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's crucial that your essay directly responds to the given question. The prompt asks to what extent you agree or disagree with a specific statement. Make sure your response clearly addresses this by stating whether you agree or disagree and then supporting your stance throughout the essay. Avoid shifting the focus away from the original question, as this can lead to a misunderstanding of the assignment requirements.

2. **Avoid Overgeneralizations**: Be cautious with statements that could be seen as overgeneralizations, such as ""It is undeniable."" The topic of news media influence is complex and opinions on it vary. It's more effective to acknowledge these differences in views within your essay to present a balanced and informed argument.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few areas where spelling, grammar, and style could be improved:
   - The term ""human these days"" might be better expressed as ""people today"" or ""individuals in contemporary society.""
   - Be mindful of verb tenses. For example, ""the benefits of the news media far outweighed its drawbacks"" might be better as ""the benefits of the news media far outweigh its drawbacks.""
   - Avoid repetition and aim for clearer sentence structure to enhance readability.

4. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Ensure that your point of view is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph should contribute to and support your overall stance on the issue. In your conclusion, reaffirm your position clearly and concisely to leave a strong impression on the reader.

5. **Descriptive Arguments**: Your essay includes arguments on both sides of the issue, which is good. However, make sure that each argument is clearly linked back to your main stance on the topic. Use specific examples and evidence to support your points. For instance, when mentioning the positive impacts of news media, it could be helpful to provide more detailed examples or statistics to strengthen your argument.

6. **Adherence to Instructions**: Always double-check the original assignment instructions after drafting your essay. This ensures that you've appropriately addressed the task and haven't inadvertently shifted away from the central topic or question.

The effort to tackle a topic that has significant impact on students' lives is commendable. However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to enhance clarity, relevance, and effectiveness of the argument presented. 

1. **Response to Topic:**
   The essay begins with the intent to discuss studying abroad but occasionally drifts away from the central topic. Specifically, the focus should remain strictly on the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad, as per the essay prompt. It's important to ensure that every paragraph directly contributes to addressing the essay question. Any deviation from the topic may confuse readers and detract from the essay's overall impact.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   The essay's structure is somewhat disorganized, affecting the clarity of the points being made. For example, the transition between ideas often relies on phrases like ""on the other hand,"" without a clear juxtaposition of ideas preceding it. Moreover, sentences beginning with ""because"" can make the argument seem less formal and disjointed. Aim for smoother transitions and more cohesive development of ideas to strengthen the argument's flow.

3. **Grammar and Style Issues:**
   The essay contains run-on sentences and occasional grammatical errors that can make it challenging for the reader to follow the argument. Breaking down complex, run-on sentences into simpler, more concise sentences can significantly improve readability. Additionally, revisiting grammar rules and carefully proofreading the essay can eliminate these errors, contributing to a more polished final product.

4. **Argument Development:**
   While the essay attempts to present both sides of studying abroad, some arguments lack depth and clarity. In several instances, claims are made without sufficient explanations or examples to support them. To make these arguments more persuasive, consider adding clear, specific examples that illustrate the advantages and disadvantages. Also, ensure that each point directly relates to the topic of studying abroad to maintain relevance.

5. **Conclusion:**
   The conclusion reiterates that studying abroad has both positives and negatives, which is a good practice. However, it lacks a strong closing statement that summarizes the essay's key points or suggests a final thought for the reader to ponder. A more impactful conclusion could enhance the essay's overall effectiveness.

In summary, focusing more on maintaining relevance to the topic, organizing the essay more coherently, simplifying complex sentences, correcting grammar issues, and developing arguments with clear examples will significantly improve the quality of the essay. These changes will not only make the essay more engaging and easier to read but also more persuasive and effective in conveying its message.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

(IELTS task 2),"Nowadays, on TV, in the newspaper, or even on the Internet, a number of adverts are springing up all over around. It is argued that advertising is brainwashing children. However, some people are in favor of advertising as a great source of information. \n To commence with, due to competitive markets, enterprises have to go all the way to make creative content to sell their products by attracting customers. Children and juveniles easily gravitate to eye-catching commercials, although they may bring nonsense meanings or even a scenario of brainwashing, some of which may lead to health harm. For instance, a large number of businesses are in an attempt to sell their attractive colorful foods to children, regardless of their ingredients, which may cause food poisoning to kids. In addition, to give an exaggerated account of goods, many videos are created with dangerous actions, which can easily make kids imitate. As a consequence, they will suffer from injuries or do damage to their health. \n However, not all adverts bring wrong and bad information, but useful ones instead. They raise people's knowledge and awareness. By teaching viewers the way to choose products and distinguish them from fake ones, consumers are more able to make better shopping choices and take advantage of its benefits. In terms of technology, advertising helps people discover more about technological devices.

You do not properly restate that portion in a manner that actually shows a good restatement. Your basis for the discussion is therefore weak and not properly targeted based on expectations. This is the main problem that you have not been able to fix over the past 3 essays you have written.","The essay addresses the topic of advertising's impact, especially on children, with arguments on both the negative and positive sides. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer expression of the author's own opinion. Instead of mentioning what ""some people"" believe, it's important to directly state your own stance on the issue. This personal view was briefly mentioned at the conclusion, but for a stronger essay, this opinion should be clear from the beginning and consistently supported throughout.

The introduction attempts to restate the topic but does this in a broad manner that doesn't effectively set a focused foundation for the discussion. To improve, clearly restate the essay topic in the introduction by specifically mentioning how advertising affects children and introduce your viewpoint right away. This will make your essay more targeted and align with the expectations of a well-structured argument.

Regarding the content and structure, the essay does provide examples and reasons for both the potentially harmful effects of advertising on children and its benefits. However, the arguments can be made stronger. For instance, when discussing the negative impacts, including specific studies or statistics could enhance credibility. Similarly, on the positive side, examples should go beyond personal anecdotes to include broader evidence that supports the beneficial role of advertising.

The essay has some issues with repetitive and unclear language that could be more concise and precise. Simplifying sentences and using more varied vocabulary can help improve clarity and readability. For example, instead of saying ""a number of adverts are springing up all over around,"" you could say ""advertisements are increasingly common.""

The writing contains a few grammatical and stylistic issues, but these are relatively minor. Paying attention to verb tense consistency, article use (""the young generation"" instead of ""young generation""), and avoiding overly general statements can make the prose clearer and more engaging.

To summarize, while the essay makes an attempt to discuss an important issue, enhancing clarity in expressing a personal viewpoint, strengthening argumentation with more diverse evidence, and refining language use are key areas for improvement.

While some people take this as a big advantage, I am of the opinion that this phenomenon is a negative outcome, and this essay will elaborate why. \n On the one hand, the present-day mode of life is beneficial in some ways. The first reason for this, we are moving towards the technological era which is destined to make human lives even more uncomplicated, pleasurable and comfy. For instance, only with pressing one button, people can have their dishes heated in the dishwasher within a short period of time or in earlier days, there were telephones, where one needed to sit in one place and talk, but now with smartphones, one can travel around and talk wherever. \n On the other hand, there are a variety of reasons why I have a tendency to object to this development. First of all, the current lifestyle poses threats to the planet. Because of the acceleration of the economy, it leads to the rapid growth of houses, factories, and various amenities that are used for entertainment and daily living. As a result, a large amount of industrial and domestic waste has been discharged into the environment such as untreated wastewater and domestic waste which subsequently result in the reduction of natural habitats and the existence of new types of pollution, such as light pollution or radioactive pollution. Moreover, the prevalence of dependence of humans on machinery is alarming and that has varied adverse effects. Technology significantly alters our lifestyle as previous actions that took human input can now be computed and executed by a machine without human interference, therefore, it encourages human laziness which puts themselves at greater risk of heart and circulatory disease. Besides, it also can lead to the loss of basic life skills such as household chores and effective communication. \n In conclusion, I totally agree with the critics of modern lifestyles.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
You have successfully addressed the essay topic by evaluating the positive and negative effects of technological advancement and economic growth. To further strengthen your argument, it would be helpful to focus more specifically on how these developments affect individuals and communities directly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
Your essay is largely clear and understandable; however, it would benefit from minor revisions for better clarity and flow. Consider avoiding overly general statements like ""It is true"" at the beginning, as they may weaken your argument. Instead, directly state your position or introduce the topic in a way that immediately engages the reader's interest.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
Your personal viewpoint on the negative consequences of modern lifestyles is clear. Enhancing your essay with more specific examples or personal experiences could offer more depth to your perspective. Additionally, directly mentioning one or two key reasons supporting your view in your introduction might make your argument stronger and more compelling right from the start.

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Support:**
While you provided reasons supporting your perspective, ensuring that the arguments are fully developed and supported with concrete examples or data would enrich your essay. You've mentioned the environmental and health-related consequences of technological reliance, which are strong points. Consider elaborating on these with more details or introducing studies that reinforce your argument. Also, try to focus on only two main reasons and deeply explore these to avoid spreading your essay too thin.

Moreover, remember that for this type of essay, presenting a balanced view isn't necessary unless the prompt explicitly asks for it. Focusing on supporting your stand with two solid arguments rather than comparing contrasting viewpoints could make your position more persuasive.

Lastly, consider your essay's organization and coherence. Ensure that each paragraph has a clear main idea and that all parts of your essay logically flow from one to the next. Transition words and phrases can help guide your reader through your argument more smoothly.

By addressing these areas, you can improve the effectiveness and persuasiveness of your essay.

Personally, I completely agree with this idea. \n On the one hand, taking a train as transportation can both reduce congestion and make people healthier. Commuters who drive cars to their workplaces are often get stuck in the rush hours due to too many cars driven to their destinations at the same time. However, taking public transportation, such as train, can not only save much money, but also prevent people from being late. Furthermore, the amount of CO2 produced by train is obviously less than by cars. This will reduce air pollution and keep residents stronger and healthier. Governments and local councils should focus on railways with financial supports to encourage more people to take. \n On the other hand, most people can not live without roads, especially the residents living in the mountains or rural areas. They completely depend on roads to connect downtowns or rural areas that provide them with enough food and groceries. If governments don't fix or build roads anymore, people will have hard time meeting their basic needs. To take Taiwan as an example, roads are very easy to be damaged by typhoons, and the fixation must be done as soon as possible to avoid people lack of food and help. Government should regularly spend enough money on roads, or there will be a great impact on people. \n In conclusion, it seems to me that the benefits of spending money on railways are more significant than on roads.","Dear student, you could have done a better job with your paraphrasing in the opening statement by dividing the single line presentation in the original prompt into 2 sentences. Then followed it up by your agreement of the discussion, without beginning a discussion at that point. the first statement should never be more than an overview of the forthcoming discussion. \n The second paragraph could have compared the expenses of the government between the road and railway in terms of practicality and usability to the public. It is in the second statement where you should have opened the discussion with the term ""Personally..."" because this is a personal opinion essay that need not discuss the basis of the original prompt. \n Your conclusion is another problematic part of the essay because it is a single sentence. In order to properly write a conclusion, you must accurately develop a concluding statement based upon the existing information in the essay you created. Wrap it up with a similar summary to the opening statement and you would have written more than 254 words with an increased possible score. This way though, I think the essay can only score a 5 due to the indicated problems regarding how you addressed the task and formatted your response.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing the advantages of funding railways over roads. However, it would benefit greatly from improvements in structure, clarity, and development of arguments.

1. **Introduction Improvement**: Starting with the introduction, the essay jumps straight into the author's stance without properly setting up the topic. A stronger introduction could first provide a brief overview of the debate on government spending on railways versus roads, and then introduce the personal stance. This approach not only clarifies the topic for the reader but also sets the stage for the ensuing discussion.

2. **Developing Arguments**: In the body paragraphs, the comparison between the benefits and drawbacks of investing in railways versus roads is a good start. Yet, it lacks specific examples and a deeper analysis comparing the practicality and cost-effectiveness of the two modes of transportation. Incorporating such details can make the arguments more persuasive and informative. Moreover, introducing personal opinions more explicitly in the second paragraph, as suggested by stating ""Personally,"" could highlight the subjective nature of the essay and clarify that it is the author's viewpoint being expressed.

3. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammar and stylistic issues that disrupt the flow. For example, ""Commuters who drive cars to their workplaces often get stuck in rush hours..."" would be clearer and grammatically correct. Also, ensuring consistent use of articles, like ""a train"" instead of just ""train,"" would help. Attention to these details can improve readability.

4. **Conclusion Enhancement**: The conclusion currently falls short by summarizing the argument in just one sentence. It would be more effective to briefly recap the key points made in the essay and then reaffirm the author's stance. This not only reinforces the arguments but also provides a satisfying closure to the essay.

5. **Clear Point of View**: While the essay presents a clear preference for government investment in railways, reinforcing this stance with more detailed reasoning, comparative analysis, and examples would strengthen the author's position.

Focusing on these aspects can transform the essay into a more compelling and well-structured argument. Engaging the reader with clear, specific, and well-developed points will make the essay not only more persuasive but also more enjoyable to read.",3,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

The essay explores an interesting topic: whether it's better for people to own a home or rent one. This is a valuable discussion with relevant points on both options. However, it's important to closely align your response with the specific questions asked in the essay prompt. The essay was expected to address why the preference for home ownership or renting might change and if this change is positive or negative. Instead, the essay presents a general comparison between owning and renting without directly addressing these questions. Here are some areas for improvement and suggestions:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The essay does not directly answer the questions posed in the prompt. It's crucial to understand and directly address the question, offering clear viewpoints and reasons. To improve, structure your essay to directly answer the question of why preferences might change and whether this change is beneficial or harmful.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   There are a few issues with grammar and style that can be refined. For example, avoid starting sentences with ""Because"" in formal writing, and watch out for run-on sentences. Use simpler, clearer sentence structures to make your argument more accessible. Additionally, pay attention to verb tense consistency and the use of singular and plural nouns, such as ""owning a home brings us the feeling of stability, safety, and comfortable"" could be revised to ""owning a home brings stability, safety, and comfort.""

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:**
   The essay attempts to present a balanced view but does not clearly state the author's personal stance on the topic. Essays typically require a clear thesis statement that summarizes the author's position. To improve, decide on your viewpoint and state it clearly in your introduction and conclusion. 

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   While the essay mentions several advantages and disadvantages of owning and renting, these points need to be developed further with clear, descriptive examples and rationales. It would also improve the essay to directly relate these arguments to the questions of why preferences might change and the implications of this change.

**Recommendations:**
- Begin with a clear thesis statement that directly responds to the essay prompt.
- Ensure each paragraph focuses on a single main idea, clearly related to your overall viewpoint.
- Use examples and reasons to support your stance, directly linking them to the question of changing preferences being positive or negative.
- Conclude with a summary that reiterates your viewpoint and the reasons behind it, ensuring it directly addresses the prompt’s questions.

By focusing on directly responding to the essay prompt, clarifying your point of view, and providing more structured arguments, your essay can become more coherent and compelling. Remember, clarity and directness are key in effectively communicating your stance on a topic.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

Furthermore, music plays an entertaining role and has a significant impact on our emotional and mental health. Various as music is, traditional music still deserves being cherished and preserved much more than the popular music does because of its importance. \n Clearly, music can prove fruitful for people by dint of its range of benefits. Firstly, listening to music can be referred as a way that people immerse in a world which is away from the hustle and the bustle of normal life. Also, intense schedule of work and studying induces stress, depression and preoccupation on everyone. Music seems to be the simplest way to do away with those negative impacts in a short time. \n Moreover, there are two main reasons for the paramount characteristics of the traditional music in a country. First and foremost, most traditional music is built on the history, culture, story of a country, which reminds young people of their countries' past. This, intentionally, raises the pride in each individual citizen and help them to learn more about their nation. Secondly, it would be so a real pity if a country lost its unique characteristics in music. Thus, young people will be sensitized to their responsibility as paying respect to their countries' music. \n In conclusion, life without music would make people encounter difficulty in living positively. Indeed, fun and catchy though modern music might be, the valuation of traditional music should never be diminished.","This essay sounds like you opened a dictionary and a thesaurus simultaneously to help you find as many impressive big sounding words that you can insert in the essay you wrote. The focus on using ""big"" words that do not create a natural discussion feel in the sentences and paragraph will be a problem for your score. That is because you are using words that may not be used in the proper context within your presentation. The examiner is trained to spot an exam taker who is merely trying to impress him with his knowledge of ""advanced"" English words, but with the inability to use it properly. Rather than scoring better in the LR and GRA section, the misuse of these words will result in a down scaling of your score instead. Words such as multitudinous, dint, paramount, to name but a few. Memorized and often used phrases such as ""hustle and bustle"" will also not help your score.","The essay provides a well-structured argument, emphasizing the value of traditional music over modern music. It effectively addresses the given topic, showcasing the importance of music in emotional and mental health and the unique cultural significance of traditional music. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the effectiveness and clarity of the argument.

1. **Use of Complex Vocabulary**: The essay frequently employs complex and advanced vocabulary that does not always fit naturally within the context or adds clarity to the argument. Words like ""multitudinous,"" ""dint,"" and ""paramount"" may seem impressive but can make the text challenging to read and understand, especially if misused. Aiming for clear and direct language that accurately conveys your ideas will likely be more impactful. Replacing or simplifying such words without losing meaning is a valuable skill. 

2. **Language and Style**: The attempt to include sophisticated phrases and terms (""hustle and bustle"") sometimes hinders the natural flow of the text. This approach can distract the reader and may not positively influence essay evaluations. A more straightforward and authentic style of writing is often more engaging and easier to follow. 

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are no significant spelling errors present, but attention to sentence structure and grammar can further polish the essay. Ensuring there is variety in sentence construction can help maintain reader interest and engagement.

4. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay does present a clear stance, advocating for the preservation and appreciation of traditional music due to its cultural and educational value. This viewpoint is consistent throughout and supported by arguments that highlight the role of music in society and its ability to connect individuals with their heritage.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay presents arguments in support of the importance of traditional music, such as its historical and cultural significance and its role in national pride. These points are strong but could be enhanced by including more specific examples or by drawing on empirical evidence or studies that reinforce the argument. Moreover, comparing the influence of traditional and modern music directly could strengthen the case for traditional music’s unique value.

In summary, focusing on clear, precise language that accurately conveys your arguments can make the essay more compelling and easier to understand. Avoiding overcomplicated vocabulary that does not add to the discussion will likely improve readability and make the text more engaging. Streamlining your argument with direct examples and evidence will also help solidify your position.",4,3,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

If you live in a city, it may bring you more advantages than you can imagine. It can not be denied that the percentage of finding a good job in a city is much higher than elsewhere because it is an ideal location for many potential companies. Not only does the city bring you many unparalleled opportunities, but it also helps you to expand your circle of acquaintances for meeting new people. Another good reason to live in a big city is to access everywhere more easily via public transportations, or a short drive. On the other hand, there are also advantages when you stay in a village. It's cheaper than living in a big city, so you can save money for other things. Also, the pace of living here is not as fast as living in a city, that means you will have more quality times with your family and friends. In conclusion, if you are thinking about where to live, consider all of these benefits and make a decision that is right for you.","Dear student, you cannot separate the word cannot into ""can not"" as that would be a conflicting reference. ""Can"" means you are able to while ""not"" means unable to. using the words separately means you are both able and not able to, that results in a confusing reference. While ""cannot"", the contracted form of the two words clearly means ""unable to"". \n You need to learn to develop your discussion points such as ""... more advantages than you can imagine."" what advantages are these? Such topic references should be used only as separate paragraph openers, not as a part of a single paragraph presentation. Your paragraph is scattered and does not have any particular discussion focus which means there is no sense to the discussion that a reader can follow. It does not have a clear discussion point that tells the reader what direction the writer is leading into. That is caused by your inability to separate and properly develop your discussion topics as you are presenting partial discussions throughout one paragraph. Overall, the essay has good discussion points but makes little sense in terms of properly explanining what these discussion points are about.","The essay attempts to address the prompt by highlighting the advantages of living in both a city and a village. However, it falls short of fully developing these arguments, making it challenging for the reader to understand the full extent of the benefits mentioned. 

Firstly, there is a minor issue with word usage: ""cannot"" should be used instead of ""can not."" The latter suggests a contradiction, implying both the ability and inability to do something simultaneously, which can confuse the reader. 

The essay could be improved by clearly developing and explaining the advantages of living in a city and a village. For instance, when mentioning that living in a city provides ""more advantages than you can imagine,"" it would be helpful to specify what these advantages are. This approach will allow the reader to fully comprehend the argument being made.

Moreover, the essay suffers from a lack of focus within its paragraphs. Each advantage is briefly mentioned without thorough explanation or development, making the overall argument feel incomplete. To improve, consider dedicating separate paragraphs to each benefit, providing examples and explanations to support each point more effectively. This will not only help in clarifying your position but also in making your essay more organized and focused.

Additionally, while the essay mentions advantages for both living situations, it does not clearly articulate a personal stance or viewpoint. Making a personal recommendation or expressing a clear preference based on the arguments presented could strengthen the essay by providing it with a more decisive conclusion.

Finally, the essay's structure and sentence variety could be enhanced for better readability and to more effectively engage the reader. Utilizing transitional phrases to smoothly connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs can also help in making your essay more cohesive.

By addressing these points, the essay can offer a more compelling and clearer discussion on the topic, enabling readers to better understand and appreciate the arguments being made.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,Argumentative

Discuss both views and state your own opinion. \n Currently, while numerous students are chosen by countless schools based on their academic capabilities, there is compelling evidence that students who have different abilities should be given the same academic environment. \n On the one hand, streaming school environments could bring many benefits for not only the teachers but also the pupils. From the teachers' perspectives, this academic learning model could help teachers design easily a more customized lesson plan for each group of students. Mathematics teachers, for example, could boost the number of Mathematics lessons and concentrate on advanced Mathematics academic fields, such as Theorems of Algebra and Geometry, rather than usual equation-solving or formula-applying exercises. Moreover, it could be easier for teachers in class management, especially students' academic management. From the students' perspective, they can reap a more in-depth understanding of the specialized subjects and feel more comfortable with remaining subjects that are not their strong points. As a result, educators could be motivated to study and show their potential, and the dropout rate could be lower. \n On the other hand, comprehensive learning environments could be advantageous for students in a few aspects. Firstly, these environments could allow exploration of the pupils' hidden abilities. This is because through being in contact with people who have numerous distinct fortes, pupils could have a chance to try many domains, including both academic and recreational domains. Therefore, they could find out their favourite ones and become motivated to follow them. For instance, after practising speaking English with an English pupil through English conservations in textbooks, a Mathematics learner could become passionate about studying this subject and searching more about its lessons. Secondly, this model of schools could enhance cooperation between students using their diversity of strengths. To exemplify, English major students could cooperate with Literature educators to dissect the world's literary masterpieces which are written in English, which could be a difficulty if they work alone. Consequently, by working as a group, students could solve many academic problems in their studies. \n In conclusion, there are some positive aspects of both these academic system designs, which should be utilized in a few respective circumstances. From my view of point, I believe that comprehensive learning environments should be promoted for students.

While your arguments offer insights into both perspectives, there are several areas where enhancements could significantly improve the overall quality of your essay.

1. **Topic Response and Introduction:**
   Your essay dives directly into the discussion without properly introducing the topic or stating the two public opinions you'll discuss. For an effective start, briefly mention the conflicting viewpoints on student selection by schools. Also, articulate your own stance clearly in the introduction. This helps set the tone and gives readers a clear understanding of the direction of your essay.

2. **Clarity of Author's Perspective:**
   While you’ve shared your perspective, it gets somewhat lost in the extensive discussion of the two sides. A stronger, more evident articulation of your own opinion throughout the essay, not just in the conclusion, would bolster your argument. It's essential to maintain a balance between discussing public opinions and interweaving your perspective clearly and consistently.

3. **Argument Structure and Support:**
   Your essay presents arguments for both sides, which is good. However, the transition between discussing the merit of segregated learning environments and comprehensive learning environments could be smoother. Try to offer equivalent attention to both views before stating your conclusion. Include comparative insights directly linking the public opinions to your views to make your argumentation more robust and coherent.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   Generally, your grammar and spelling are satisfactory, but watch out for complex sentences that may become convoluted. Simplify your language for clarity. For example, instead of ""streaming school environments could bring many benefits,"" consider ""Selecting students based on ability can benefit both teachers and students."" Likewise, ensure your essay's style remains formal and appropriate for an academic setting.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Your conclusion reintroduces your stance, which is good practice. However, it could be more impactful by summarizing the key advantages of both viewpoints briefly before restating your opinion. This not only reinforces the discussion but also clearly marks your final assessment.

6. **Miscellaneous:**
   - Ensure references to “perspectives,” “views,” or “opinions” are clearly attributed to either the general public or yourself to avoid confusion.
   - Balanced discussion: Providing equal weight to both sides of the argument (advantages and disadvantages) before concluding ensures a balanced and reasoned essay.

In summary, focusing on a clear introduction of the topic and your stance, balancing the discussion of both views including your own throughout the essay, and simplifying language for clarity will greatly enhance your essay.

However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and adherence to typical essay-writing conventions.

1. **Topic Response and Structure**: Your essay begins with a somewhat confusing statement due to the incorrect use of ""but"" in the first sentence. Removing unnecessary conjunctions could make your opening clearer. For example, you could say, ""Even though recycling has become well-known, waste is not treated efficiently in most homes."" It's important to express your viewpoint and the reasons supporting it more clearly right from the start, ensuring your essay directly responds to the prompt. Your discussion leans towards comparing different methods to encourage recycling, which is valuable but diverges slightly from focusing on a single, clear argument supporting your position. Essays typically benefit from presenting a clear stance supported by strong, focused arguments.

2. **Sentence Formation and Grammar**: Pay attention to sentence structure and grammar throughout your essay. Incorrect sentence formation, as seen in the opening line, can confuse readers. Practicing sentence building can help in writing more coherent statements. Additionally, watch for verb tense consistency and proper pluralization (""people's actions,"" not ""people actions""). 

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from simpler, more direct language. This approach is particularly helpful for English language learners and ensures your arguments are accessible to a wider audience. Clear, concise language helps maintain reader engagement and ensures your points are communicated effectively.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you present a range of ideas, from legal penalties to educational measures and incentive systems, ensuring each point directly supports your overarching thesis will strengthen your essay. For example, when discussing the benefits of implementing rewards, offer specific examples of how this approach has worked in the past or could work based on human psychology. Clear and direct support for your arguments enhances the persuasive power of your essay.

5. **Conclusion**: Reiterate your main points succinctly in your conclusion, reinforcing why alternative solutions may be more effective than legislation. Your conclusion should give a sense of closure and finality to the discussion, summarizing your perspective without introducing new information.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: You've provided examples, such as the album ""Love Yourself"", to support your arguments, which is great. To enhance your essay, integrate more specific examples and elaborate on how these examples illustrate your points. For instance, explain how the album has influenced listeners worldwide, demonstrating the global impact of music.

Lastly, your essay falls slightly short of the expected word count. Aiming for a minimum of 250 words ensures you have adequately developed your ideas. Expanding on your arguments, providing more examples, or including a brief conclusion can help you reach or exceed the word count while adding value to your essay. Remember, fully developed paragraphs are essential for demonstrating your understanding and analytical skills in English.

This is the reason for the suggested remedy which is imposing a higher tax on high-fat foods. Although this measure could be effective in a few ways, it may lead to drastic consequences that far outweigh any advantages it brings. \n There might be some specific reasons why the higher price of fast food is advantageous. in solving overweight-related problems. One important reason is that an increase in the price of fattening foods could discourage potential customers, who are well aware of their budget and cannot purchase them. For instance, if a KFC dish costs triple as much as a healthy vegetable meal, people are more likely to select the second option. As a result, the amount of fat that they gain is low, thus preventing obesity. Another reason is that fast food companies will meet financial burdens due to a drop in their products' consumption, which may force them to invest in fewer advertising projects, which largely contribute to the rise of fatty food consumption. Consequently, fewer people notice announcements from those businesses, which means they have little motivation to consume high-fat foods. This produces a positive effect on people's health, as their fat input decreases. \n Notwithstanding, there is more persuasive evidence that the resolution mentioned exerts adverse effects on society. One explanation is that a rise in unhealthy food might not decrease its consumption. This is because people may keep selecting this food, even at higher prices, if they are affordable and to the customers' appetite. Furthermore, some people who have weight issues may experience eating disorders as they consider overeating as a way to ease their suffering. Consequently, they may continue to consume unhealthy food options. In addition to this, making fattening foods more expensive means that huge corporations including McDonald's and Pizza Hut have to experience heavy money loss. When those businesses face financial burdens, staff-reducing decisions are inevitable. As a result, a large number of workers, including financially disadvantaged ones, will be unemployed. Thus, they will be forced to rely on even cheaper, unhealthier food options. \n In conclusion, while raising the price of fatty foods could create a positive impact in a few aspects, there are more compelling reasons why other remedies which are more effective should be adopted. It is recommended that diet education be added to schools' curricula. Besides, encouraging people to engage in regular physical exercises is also needed.","This essay is tremendously overwritten. You will not be able to write over 400 words within 40 minutes. Remmeber that you need to allot time to review, edit, and revise your content before submitting the essay.

The essay successfully adheres to the topic by discussing the impact of imposing higher taxes on high-fat foods. However, there are areas that require attention to enhance the essay's effectiveness and to ensure it meets the standards expected for English proficiency tests.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay aptly addresses the given topic, which is a strength. The arguments for and against raising taxes on fatty foods are communicated, providing a balanced view. To further improve, ensure every point directly relates to how this action impacts society's health and economy. This sharpens the essay's focus and relevance to the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are a few minor errors and stylistic concerns within the essay. For instance, lowercase letters are used at the beginning of sentences in a couple of instances, e.g., ""in solving overweight-related problems."" Capitalize the first word in every sentence for correctness. Additionally, phrasing like ""huge corporations including McDonald's and Pizza Hut have to experience heavy money loss"" could be simplified to ""large corporations such as McDonald's and Pizza Hut may face significant financial losses."" This makes the argument clearer and the language more formal.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay presents a clear stance, suggesting that alternative solutions might be more effective than taxing high-fat foods. To make this viewpoint even clearer, consider stating your position early on and reinforcing it in the conclusion. This bookends the essay neatly and leaves a strong impression of your argument.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The arguments for both sides of the issue are outlined, which is excellent. However, to strengthen these arguments, include more concrete evidence, such as studies or statistics, to support claims. For example, when mentioning that higher prices may not deter consumption, citing research that supports this assertion would make the argument more persuasive.

5. **Brevity and Coherence:** As highlighted, there's a tendency to overwrite, which may lead to essays that exceed word limits and contain unnecessary complexity. Aim for concise, straightforward expressions to convey your points. For instance, rather than explaining in detail how high prices might lead to a complex cascade of socio-economic outcomes, focus on a couple of key impacts and examine them thoroughly within a more limited word count. Practicing writing within a 300-word limit, as suggested, can help in developing the skill to express arguments efficiently and clearly.

By addressing these areas, the essay will not only meet the guidelines more closely but also communicate ideas more effectively, ensuring they are accessible to all readers. Remember, a focused, well-argued essay is more impactful than one that merely covers more ground.

Personally, I strongly disagree \n with the statement above \n In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st century. As the increase in the world's population, more lands, and animals' habitats are being exploited for farming or building large-scale infrastructure, and innovative facilities. However, there is plenty of rooms in high-rise apartments for us to dwell. As a result, we can utilize the remain of space for animals. Furthermore, there are no compelling reasons why we should let these species be on the brink of extinction. \n Moreover, I also disagree with the idea that conservating wildlife is a waste of resources due to its significant advantages for the world. It appears that protecting natural resources ensures the survival of these wild animals. To be more precise, when we guard the biological diversity of rainforests means we stabilize \n the Earth's climate because rainforests absorb Carbon dioxide and release oxygen for breathing. They prevent many specific regions from flooding reservoirs. By protecting natural dwellers and their habitats, we can maintain the sustainability of the Earth \n To put everything in a nutshell, it is believed that wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so people have no obligation to protect them.

Answer if one shares the opinion (e.g. I can understand why one would think this. / I can see reasons to not believe this statement) \n 3. Give a summary of 2 supporting reasons. \n The essay is frustrating to read because the writer shows a total disregard for paragraph formatting. A consideration heavily observed by the examiners.

Careless writing will always result in a failing score.","The essay addresses the topic by taking a clear stance against the idea that wildlife preservation is not a priority in the 21st century. This position is commendable as it aligns with the essay's requirements to express a personal viewpoint on the matter. However, to enhance clarity and impact, the introduction could be refined to follow a three-step approach: restating the topic succinctly, directly stating personal agreement or disagreement, and summarizing two primary supporting reasons. This structure would make the argument more accessible and compelling right from the start.

A significant area that needs improvement is paragraph formatting. The essay currently presents its arguments in a continuous block of text, which makes it difficult for readers to follow and detracts from the overall effectiveness of the argument. Breaking down the essay into well-organized paragraphs—one for the introduction, one for each main argument, and one for the conclusion—would significantly improve readability and follow expected academic formatting, which is critical for essay assessments.

On the matter of language and style, there are a few issues to address. First, watch out for the incorrect use of words and phrases such as ""doesn't worth being preserved"" which should be ""isn't worth preserving,"" and ""there is plenty of rooms"" which should be ""there is plenty of room."" Attention to correct grammar and phrasing is essential for conveying your arguments with authority.

The essay's arguments in favor of wildlife conservation—referencing the loss of animal habitats to human expansion and the ecological benefits of rainforests—are persuasive and relevant. Nonetheless, these points would benefit from clearer and more descriptive explanations. For instance, elaborating on how wildlife conservation is directly linked to the sustainability of the Earth by providing specific examples or statistics could make the arguments more convincing.

Finally, the conclusion effectively reaffirms the writer's position but could be strengthened by briefly summarizing the key arguments presented. This would reinforce the essay's message and leave readers with a strong, lasting impression of its validity.

In summary, the essay tackles the given topic with a determined stance, which is commendable.

The argument provides a balanced view by recognizing the benefits of technology and strongly supporting the unique value of teachers. However, there are some areas for improvement to enhance its effectiveness and relevance.

1. **Response to Topic:** Without the original essay prompt, it's challenging to assess the precision of the response accurately. To ensure your essay directly addresses the given topic, always include or reference the original question. This will help clarify your understanding of the assignment and allow for more tailored feedback. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** Overall, your essay maintains a satisfactory level of grammar and spelling. Nonetheless, attention to detail could improve clarity and readability.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your stance on the indispensable role of teachers is clear throughout the essay. You effectively articulate the importance of human interaction in education, which cannot be replaced by technology. This perspective is well-presented and consistently maintained, providing a coherent argument.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The essay puts forward several arguments to support your point of view, such as the emotional connection between teachers and students and the unique ability of teachers to address students' difficulties. However, these arguments could be strengthened further. For instance, providing more concrete examples or citing specific studies to support the claim about teachers' influence on children's behavior, beyond a brief mention, would lend more persuasive power to your essay. Additionally, expanding your discussion to contrast more explicitly how technology fails to replicate these unique human contributions could enrich your argument. 

5. **Development of Ideas:** As pointed out, the presentation of each paragraph could benefit from deeper development. Explore your points more thoroughly to make the essay more compelling. Expanding on how technology and human educators complement each other while emphasizing the irreplaceable aspects of human touch, empathy, and the nuanced understanding teachers bring to complex interpersonal dynamics would provide a more nuanced argument.

However, to make the essay stronger and clearer, here are some suggestions aimed at improving it.

Firstly, the essay attempts to address the topic but falls short in clearly stating the original prompt or question, leaving readers guessing about the exact argument or standpoint you're responding to. Starting with a clearer explanation of the topic, such as how leadership styles might differ between genders and the potential benefits of women in leadership roles, could help set a solid foundation for your argument.

Regarding the language and structure, there are several areas in need of improvement for clarity and correctness. For example, phrases like ""womanly presidents"" and ""run by womanly presidents"" might be better expressed as ""female presidents"" or ""women presidents"" to maintain a more formal and respectful tone. The use of ""harmonic instincts"" and ""internal maternal instinct of female hardly constitutes by competed preference or dictatorial psychology"" is confusing and disrupts the flow of your argument. It seems you're trying to say that women's maternal instincts might make them less likely to engage in conflict compared to men, but this point could be made more clearly. Consider rewriting these sentences for clarity and simplicity, focusing on how maternal instincts might influence leadership style without making broad generalizations.

Additionally, the examples and arguments used could benefit from being updated and more accurately represented. While Elizabeth I is mentioned as a peaceful leader, this choice might not be the most effective, given her complex reign and involvement in conflicts. Including more contemporary examples of female leadership and their impact could strengthen your argument and make it more relevant to current readers.

Furthermore, there are grammatical and stylistic issues throughout the essay. Paying attention to sentence structure, verb tense consistency, and punctuation will improve the overall readability. For instance, better transitional phrases between paragraphs and within arguments could help guide the reader through your points more smoothly.

Your conclusion rightly underscores your central argument that female leadership might lead to more beneficial and democratic outcomes. However, it would be even more impactful if backed by clearer, well-supported arguments throughout the essay.

Finally, it's essential to ensure that the point of view is consistently clear, aiming to articulate a reasoned argument supported by evidence or logical reasoning rather than relying on broad generalizations.

In summary, by clarifying the response to the topic, refining the language and grammar, offering more precise and modern examples, and ensuring arguments are clearly supported, the essay could present a compelling case for the potential benefits of female leadership.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

There are those who argue that these shows are an great approach for hunting the veiled talents, while others oppose the view and claim that they are nothing but amusement. In the following discussion I will show both the points have some merits. \n Looking back on the past, people used not to have a lot of opportunities to manifest their natural ability. It is a different experience when these days anyone can participate in a talent contest no matter who they are or where they are from. These competitions are seemingly a golden platform for common people to show their hidden talent, turn their dreams into reality, and help them ultimately change from 'ordinary' people to 'well-known' figure. What is more, the competitors have the chance to receive worthy rewards from the shows like ""The Voice"", ""Road to Mount Olympia"", ""Vietnam's Got Talent""... Also, they can even become country's delegate to go in for international arena with the aim of bringing fame to their own country in the competitions such as ""The Brain"", ""Miss Universe""... Therefore, it is probably that the televised competitions is a positively good way to find gifted people. \n On the other hand, in my opinion, the televised shows have achieved entertaining purpose greatly. Firstly, participants can have a whale of a time when joining in the contests, even if they are not winners. In addition, the amusement from these shows such as comedy, music... may bring chirky relaxing moments for viewers so as to refresh themselves after a busy day. Also, the more people enjoy the shows, the higher the ratings are and consequently, the broadcaster can earn more financial profits. As for me, it is probably an appropriate circle. \n In conclusion, I am convinced that talent contests on television are a good way as a mean to look for hidden talents. Moreover, they could also be a really entertaining way for people who want to relax or want to give it a try intending to challenge themselves.","Try not to use words that do not have a direct relationship or have a different meaning from the original word. In this case, you used the word ""hunting"" in reference to the original word ""finding"". The more proper term would have been ""scouting"", which is what these talent shows do. They ""scout"" for new talent. The definition of the word scout is ""to make a search"". \n Now, the original prompt is asking you decide between one of two things: \n 1. Talent shows are a good method of finding people; \n 2. Talent shows are just for entertainment. \n You are being required to choose one of the 2 possible responses to the given discussion topic.

You were to pick one side of the discussion to defend in the essay. The later part of the essay, where you finally decided to pick a side to discuss, should have been the sole point of view being discussed throughout the essay. The comparative discussion was unnecessary and lowered your scoring potential. \n As you can see, writing 349 words did not help your essay because you did not provide the discussion requirements and format as indicated in the original prompt. Writing more words will not help if you are not prompt adherent based on the scoring guidelines of the original discussion.","Your essay on whether talent competitions on television are mainly for discovering hidden talents or just for entertainment presents a balanced view before concluding that they serve both purposes. Here are some points to consider for improving your essay further:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay needed to focus on choosing one clear position in response to the prompt. The prompt asked whether talent shows are a good way to find people or merely for entertainment. Instead of discussing the benefits of both perspectives, concentrating on defending a single viewpoint throughout the essay would have made your argument stronger and more focused.

2. **Word Choice and Accuracy:** Be mindful of your word choice. For example, ""hunting"" for talents might be better expressed as ""scouting"" for talents, as ""scouting"" directly relates to searching or looking for something, which is more accurate in the context of talent shows. Choosing the correct words will make your essay clearer and more effective.

3. **Grammar and Style:** There are a few stylistic issues to address:
   - Avoid using an series of examples like ""The Voice"", ""Road to Mount Olympia"", ""Vietnam's Got Talent"" without explaining how they specifically support your argument. It's more effective to discuss one example in detail.
   - Consider using simpler language and shorter sentences. This approach can help make your essay more accessible and easier to understand.
   - Be cautious with spelling and grammatical errors. For instance, ""an great approach"" should be ""a great approach"". Regularly review your work for such mistakes.

4. **Clarifying Point of View:** Your conclusion does a good job of summarizing your viewpoint. However, establishing a clear stance from the beginning and consistently supporting it throughout would strengthen your argument. Remember, it's not about presenting multiple perspectives but about persuasively advocating for your chosen stance.

5. **Supporting Arguments:** While you provided examples of talents being discovered and the entertainment value of shows, further development of these points with more detailed explanations or evidence could enhance your argument. For instance, when mentioning the opportunity for ordinary people to become well-known, adding a specific example of an individual who achieved fame through talent shows would be compelling.

The stance is assertively stated, showing a strong opinion in favor of the proposition. This clarity of opinion is a definite strength.

However, to enhance the essay, focusing on a few key areas is advisable:

1. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: There are noticeable errors in grammar and sentence structure that, if corrected, could significantly improve the readability and impact of the essay. Engaging in grammar exercises and applying those lessons to writing will not only make the essay clearer but also elevate the overall quality of the work. For example, consider revising sentences that are overly complex or lack clarity, such as ""In other words, they are likely want to show off themself in order to impress their peers by violating laws such as: wave in and out, drive without wearing helmet or run the traffic light, and seeming like it very cool."" A clearer revision could be, ""In other words, they often want to impress their peers by violating traffic laws, such as weaving in and out of traffic, not wearing helmets, or running red lights, which they think looks cool.""

2. **Development of Arguments**: While the essay presents arguments in favor of raising the legal driving age, these could be strengthened by providing more detailed examples and evidence. For instance, when mentioning that 60% of accident cases in Bach Mai Hospital are caused by teenagers, elaborating on the data source and context could lend more credibility to the argument. Additionally, trying to simplify and clarify the arguments will make them more accessible to a broad audience.

3. **Use of Evidence**: Incorporating specific examples and research findings strengthens the argument. However, ensure that these pieces of evidence are cited correctly and clearly explained. For instance, when referring to research about the impacts of accidents on teenagers' mental health, providing more detailed information about the studies (such as the authors, publication year, and key findings) would enhance the essay’s persuasive power.

4. **Clarity and Coherence**: While the essay's overall direction is commendable, working on the coherence and flow between ideas could improve its persuasive effect. This includes using transition words and phrases to connect ideas and ensuring that each paragraph logically flows to the next.

In conclusion, this essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and presents a clear viewpoint. By focusing on improving grammar and sentence structure, further developing and supporting arguments, and ensuring coherence throughout, the quality and persuasiveness of the essay can be significantly enhanced.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits? \n Some parents consider video games a helpful mean for entertainment and education, while others claim that their children are under negative influence of computer games. Despite some certain positive effects of these games on users, I argue that they have more disadvantages than advantages. \n METHOD 1: 1-IDEA PARAGRAPH \n On the one hand, video games can be helpful in improving the brain's speed. While gaming , the brain receives multiple simulations, both visual and audial. According to research, individuals who play video games frequently can process these simulators faster than others. These simulators ensure that the brain is continuously working to interpret them. \n On the other hand, I argue that the benefit above could be outweighed by the drawback. One typical disadvantage is that video games could negatively affect the mental health of the players. Playing electronic games discourages loses the gamers interests to involve in in following their daily routine in normal way such as playing sports or hanging out with friends; thus, they are not fascinated about performing outdoor activities anymore. One striking example of this is the appearance of an interactive game as a form of mobile application called Pokemon Go, which attracts a huge number of youngsters, including children. Unfortunately, this addictive game leads causes the players to be addicted to the point that they ignore traffic their daily routine and even play it when they are on busy streets. As a result, the gamers not only remain in their own virtual world reduced contacts with the outside world and but also bear causes the risks of accidents to not only themselves but also other drivers.","Dear student, this is an essay that will not pass in an actual test setting due to the word count presented. The minimum for a Task 2 essay is 250 words. You wrote only 221 words. that means you are short of the minimum count by 29 words. The 250 words should also be presented in a 5 paragraph format composed of a 3-5 sentences each. Your essay is missing a proper introduction, an additional body of paragraph, and a concluding summary statement at the end. These are the reasons why your essay is not being presented in the proper format. \n This is an opinion essay. As such, all opinion essays must present a singular point of view, without ever making reference to a comparison statement as you did in this essay. The body of paragraphs should only justify your opinion based upon the following (in paragraph form): \n 1. Public opinion \n 2. Personal opinion \n 3. Example to support the given opinion \n Afterwhich, all the information should be significantly summarized in the closing summary paragraph. \n When you write these essays, do not outline your writing as you did in this one. You should not separate your opening statement from the rest of the essay by indicating ""Method 1"". Remember, you should only write one version of the essay without identifying what type it is. You don't have the time to compare 2 versions of your writing in the actual test due to the need to review, revise, and edit the essay that you will have written at that point. You should be practicing this early, to write in one method. Make sure that it is the method that you are comfortable writing in. That is also the reason why your second method posting was deleted by the admin. We have a one essay per thread ruling here and your 2 method posting constituted a violation of that rule. Hence, the deletion that was done. \n Work on presenting a more effective opening statement. You cannot present less than 3 sentences per paragraph as you will lose points for that. Rather than writing run on sentences or dividing your thoughts using commas, use a period instead. That is guaranteed to also help you achieve the proper word count as you will be forced to write longer sentences to express yourself, thus allowing you to create more complex sentence presentations in the process. A more proper opening statement could be: \n <em>Videogames are seen as a method of safe entertainment and a learning instrument by some. Others only see a negative aspect to the activity for a number of reasons. I believe that videogames have more drawbacks than benefits for the players. I will discuss my reasons for this below.</em> \n The opening summary should be composed of information that will outline your body of paragraphs. In this instance, the outline indicates: \n 1. The topic for discussion \n 2. The 2 opinions regarding the topic \n 3. Your personal opinion as the main discussion point \n Based on the information provided in the original prompt, your paraphrased opening could be as much as 5 sentences, which would definitely help to increase your scoring potential. Since you provided less than the required number of words, you will also receive points deductions for that so don't expect to get a passing score when you write less than 250 words. Between the lacking word count and other errors in your writing and essay development, you won't be left with much of a score per criteria.","The essay has a good start in addressing the topic about the effects of video games, taking a clear stance that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. However, there are several areas where improvement is required to enhance the essay's structure, depth, and coherence, making it more effective and aligned with expectations for an English proficiency test.

Firstly, the essay needs to meet the minimum word count requirement of 250 words to be considered complete for assessment. Currently, at 221 words, it falls short. To address this, consider adding a proper introduction, at least one additional body paragraph, and a concluding statement. These elements are crucial for providing a well-rounded argument and adhering to the expected five-paragraph format.

When writing, avoid labeling sections like ""METHOD 1"" or dividing your essay into multiple methods or outlines. A cohesive and uninterrupted piece of writing is essential. Aim to express your views in a flowing, unified manner without explicitly dividing the essay into sections or indicating different approaches within the same piece.

In terms of structure, ensure that each paragraph consists of 3-5 sentences, as this helps in clearly developing your points and maintaining a logical progression of ideas. Regarding content, the body paragraphs should focus on justifying your opinion with public opinion, a personal viewpoint, and solid examples. 

The opening statement could be made more comprehensive and inviting. For example, introducing the topic by presenting both views on video games before stating your position can make your introduction more engaging. This not only sets the stage for your argument but also helps in increasing your word count.

There are spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that need attention. For instance, ""loses the gamers interests"" should be corrected to ""loses the gamers' interest,"" and ""negatively affect"" to ""have a negative effect on."" Additionally, breaking up long, run-on sentences into shorter, clearer ones will enhance readability and precision.

The essay does touch on the psychological impacts of video gaming but could provide a more nuanced exploration of the topic. Including more specific examples, data, or studies could fortify your argument, making it more compelling.

Lastly, ensure your conclusion effectively summarizes your main points and restates your stance, providing a clear closure to your argument. This will tie your essay together and reinforce your position on the matter.

By addressing these areas, you will not only meet the test's requirements but also develop a more persuasive and well-structured essay.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4884,https://essayforum.com/writing/preserving-wild-animals-important-81758/,dev,IELTS WRITING TASK 2: PRESERVING WILD ANIMALS IS VERY IMPORTANT,"Despite more animals are under major threat due to human, some people think that it is a waste of time, effort and money to protect wild animals because they are of no use to human. I completely disagree with this opinion. \n It appears to me that wild animals have contributed substantially to the ecosystem and human's life. Wild animals are a crucial part of a healthy ecosystem, because each animal has a unique place in the natural food chain. If an animal dies out, it will disturb the whole food chain and lead to disastrous consequences. For instance, as a result of large carnivores being poached, herbivores, which have no predators, will soar in number and move to agricultural lands to meet their growing food demand. In addition, for aesthetic values, wild animals beautify the Earth and their natural attractiveness has captured numerous people's heart, as shown in human's interest in wildlife safaris worldwide. \n Because of their importance, in my opinion, it is not wasteful to spend national budget on protecting wild animals. One way of saving wild animals is preserving their natural habitats, which are also essential to human's survival. For example, forests, which are home to plenty of wild animals, help human prevent soil erosion and flooding as well as regulate the Earth's climate. Another method is building more wildlife sanctuaries, which provide not only a safe, secure environment for endangered species but also an attraction for nature lovers and a source of income for localities. \n In conclusion, wildlife plays a great role in human's life, therefore it should be preserved.","Moon, you should be using the verb ""being under major threat"" instead of verb ""are"". This paragraph has a singular-plural problem as you refer to ""human"" in connection to ""people"". The proper plural reference ""humans"" must be used in connection with the term ""people"" which is the plural form of ""person"". The opening paragraph is also a run-on sentence. Please remember to split-up your paragraphs into short or medium length sentences for clarity and conciseness. \n You cannot say that ""It appears to me"" because the proper phrase is ""It appears to be that... "" or the simpler ""it appears that..."" which both means you are delivering an impression of something. By saying ""It appears that"", you would be totally omitting a direct reference and keeping it general instead to avoid any confusion in the phrase usage. Do not use the ownership form ""human's"" when you mean to use the collective form ""humans"" in reference to the ecosystem. Do not say ""dies out"" as that is a redundancy you could use any form of the word ""extinction"" instead which means a total loss of one species within the ecosystem without possibility of regeneration. The additional information at the end of the second paragraph is under discussed and creates an under developed paragraph and confusing paragraph presentation. \n You cannot use the word ""because"" to start a sentence as there is no previous thought process to connect in the presentation. You could instead say ""Due to their importance..."" Which creates a more authoritative presentation of your thought process for that sentence. Regardless of these errors, you are not being asked for a solution as there is no problem presented in the essay. This is only a discussion essay, not a solution essay. So your last paragraph is totally out of place and creates an incorrect discussion presentation of the prompt requirements. You will only be scored on the applicable areas of your discussion which will result in a less than minimum word count, for which you will receive point deductions in the final scoring consideration. The second reasoning paragraph should have clearly explained why you believe that the animals need to be protected, You could have used the under developed aesthetic discussion in that paragraph instead, which would have resulted in a well developed discussion presentation. \n I am sure you already know what the problem with your concluding paragraph is as I keep reminding you of that error yet you keep doing it. What is the concluding basis for your declaration that wildlife should be preserved? Complete the concluding summary.","This essay addresses the importance of protecting wild animals, arguing against the view that such efforts are a waste of resources. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and argumentation.

1. **Response to Topic and Clarity of Argument**:
The essay is aligned with the topic, presenting a clear stance that protecting wild animals is not a waste of resources. Nonetheless, the opening sentence could be rephrased for clarity and correctness. Instead of ""Despite more animals are under major threat due to human,"" consider ""Despite many animals being under significant threat from humans..."" This modification avoids the singular-plural inconsistency and improves sentence structure.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:
- The term ""humans"" should be used instead of ""human"" when referring to people collectively, ensuring agreement in number.
- Avoid starting sentences with ""Because"" to improve sentence variety and coherence. ""Due to their importance..."" is a more effective transition.
- Replace ""It appears to me that"" with ""It appears that"" for clarity and to maintain an objective tone.
- Consider rephrasing ""dies out"" with ""becomes extinct"" to accurately describe the loss of a species.
- The use of short to medium sentences can aid in maintaining the reader's attention and ensuring that each point is clearly communicated.

3. **Point of View and Argument Development**:
The point of view is consistently against the notion that protecting animals is wasteful. However, expanding on the argument by further developing the aesthetic value of wild animals and presenting a more detailed discussion would strengthen the essay. Each paragraph should fully explore its main idea to prevent underdevelopment.

4. **Use of Descriptive Arguments**:
While the essay provides a good foundation of arguments supporting wildlife protection, elaborating on these points with more examples or evidence could enhance its persuasiveness. The aesthetic value of wild animals, for example, is mentioned but not thoroughly discussed. Dedicating a separate paragraph to explain how animals contribute to aesthetic value and human well-being could be beneficial.

5. **Conclusion**:
The conclusion summarizes the argument but could be more impactful by reinforcing the main reasons why wildlife protection is essential, linking back to the points made throughout the essay. Ensure that the conclusion effectively encapsulates the argument made, providing a solid ending to the discussion.

By focusing on these areas, the essay can better convey its message, with enhanced clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness in arguing for the protection of wild animals.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

As a result, they obsess with having high-score is priority by the thinking of their parents. Moreover, juveniles can get depressed, mental health problem or even hurt themselves regularly.

What is more, because of learning, a plethora of children do not alike to care about their appearances. As a consequence, despite excellent students, they can be isolated by their classmates. Therefore, parents should decrease their works to spend more time aside their juveniles and encourage them when getting low marks to avoid those negative impacts. \n All things considered, to enhance teenagers in learning, both of themselves and their parents have to cooperate together.

However, there are several areas where this essay can be significantly improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness in conveying the intended message.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay does partially address the topic by discussing the challenges in the learning environment and suggesting remedies. However, the linkage between these challenges and the suggested remedies is not very clear. It is important to directly tie your discussions back to the main question or statement you are addressing. Consider introducing specific examples or more detailed explanations of how the proposed remedies could directly impact the issues discussed.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay struggles with grammar, sentence structure, and word choice, which significantly hinders its clarity. To improve, focus on constructing simple, well-structured sentences. Start with a subject, followed by a verb, and then an object, before adding additional details. Avoid complicated phrases or words where simpler ones will do. Reading your sentences out loud or using writing aids can help identify awkward or incorrect structures. Also, careful proofreading is essential to spot and correct spelling errors.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay's point of view seems to be that the change in learning perspectives is negative, primarily due to parental misunderstanding. However, this stance is not clearly articulated nor consistently maintained throughout. Make your thesis statement more prominent at the beginning and revisit it throughout the essay to ensure your arguments always support your main point.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: While the essay attempts to make arguments supporting the view that changes in learning perspectives have been negative, these points are often broad and lack specific, descriptive support. For instance, when mentioning the negative impacts of parental pressure, providing concrete examples or referencing studies would strengthen your argument. Similarly, when suggesting remedies, detail the steps or actions that could be implemented, explaining why and how they would make a difference.

Improving on these fronts will make the essay more compelling, understandable, and effective in persuading or informing the reader.

This response alteration was most likely caused by the writers unfamiliarity with the various task 2 discussion question and response formats.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the role of news media in modern society, aiming to explore its importance and the positive and negative impacts it may have. However, there are several areas that need improvement to better align the essay with the requirements of the prompt and enhance its overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Essay Response and Focus**:
   - It appears that the essay does not directly address the specific prompt question, which asks whether the influence of the news media is generally positive or negative. Instead, the essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages of news media, which deviates from the expected response format. Focusing on clearly stating whether the influence is positive or negative and supporting that stance throughout the essay will more directly answer the question and strengthen the essay's alignment with the prompt.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:
   - There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors that hinder the clarity and professionalism of the essay. For instance, spelling errors (""advantagous"" should be ""advantageous"", ""prosecusor"" should be ""precursor"") and grammatical mistakes (""a large amount of imformation"" should be ""a large amount of information"", ""as a results"" should be ""as a result"") can distract from the message.

- Begin by clearly stating whether the influence of the news media is considered positive or negative, and maintain this stance consistently.
- Revise the essay to fix spelling and grammatical errors, and improve sentence structure for clarity.
- Ensure that each paragraph provides clear and direct support for the essay's main argument, directly relating to the prompt.

While many point out that helping people relieve stress is the most crucial role of music, I disagree with this idea because I believe that music has other equally important functions including driving people's productivity and support musicians to convey their emotions or messages. \n On the one hand, I believe that one of music's undeniably outstanding missions is being a measure for people's pressures and mental strains. Firstly, from a scientific perspective, healing music with slow rhythms can curb the production of cortisol - the stress hormone, and enhance the dopamine generation cycle - the hormone stimulating our brains to receive positive emotions. In reality, in the past few years, the emerge of million-stream ""healing"" or ""chilling"" playlists with a wide range of Jazz songs, piano cover audios, or classical tracks on streaming platforms like Youtube, Spotify, and Souncloud has become a prominent trend. The huge number of streams as well as the increasingly monthly listeners quantity ascertain the role of music as a tool of relaxing. Moreover, to musicians, singers or other individuals working in the music industry, music may be like a magical remedy for stresses, or even mental illnesses. Many renowned artists like Billie Janet Jackson, Halsey, Eilish, etc. publicly disclosed how they struggled wth mental health issues and how music became a supplement type in their treatment process of emotional breakdowns. \n However, music can bring other irrefutable benefits to mankind: to boost working or studying productivity and to unveil implicit feelings and messages. First, when listening to music, people can enhance their deep concentration level and cognitive capacity - two fundamental factors for individuals working in fields requiring the utter vigilance and logical thingking such as programmers, software engineers or scientific researchers. Another key benefit of music is its ability to dedicately express songwriters' thoughts, emotions, and messages, which other tools' such as stories, poems, or speeches may not be as effective as. Thanks to lyrics, beats and melodies, a sad love stragedy, a desire to seize the freedom or a pride in hometown landscapes can be described vividly. Therefore, musicians can find sympathy from their audience, bring positive energy into life or awake listeners' hidden compassions and passions. Michael Jackson - a king of pop sucessfully provoked people's sense of responsibilty for our Earth through classical songs like 'Heal the world', 'We are the world', 'Earth song', etc. \n In conclusion, I disagree with the view that the most significant role of music is supporting people in relieving stress, because I believe that productive capacity intensifying and affections communicating are music's other equally important functions.","When asked to write an extent response, do your best to actually quantify your response with a type of emotional measurement. Do not use a basic dis/agree response because that in an incomplete response and will only be partially scored. Indicate a reference to a full, strong, or partial measurement to your dis/agreement to create a properly formatted openmon that will receive full scoring credits. That said, I have to commend the well written discussion short form. It shows the direction the reasoning paragraphs will be taking. \n Since the instruction does not include a comparison reference, you do not need to justify the opposing side. The examiner will base the C + C score of the essay on how well you defend your opinion using one or 2 reasons. The current explanation set up will be considered lacking in writer reasoning development. The opposing paragraph will not be considered in the scoring process. It will lower the C + C score. \n There are also punctuation lesage problems here. An apostrophe is not always needed when representing the plural form ofa word. Please familiarize yourself with punctuation usage rules overall to prevent future GRA deductions. Comma usage, run-on sentences (specially in the conclusion) , and other grammar problems also abound. This should be a major concern for you since this is a major scoring section in the test.","The essay addresses an interesting topic about the roles of music in people’s lives, suggesting that aside from relieving stress, music also enhances productivity and enables musicians to express emotions and messages. However, there are areas for improvement in structure, clarity, and grammar that can make the argument stronger and more compelling.

1. **Response to the Topic:** While the essay attempts to argue against music's primary role as a stress reliever, the approach to disagreement could be more effectively framed. Instead of a simple agreement or disagreement, try to express the extent of your viewpoint with more nuanced phrases. For example, instead of stating ""I disagree,"" you could say ""I partly agree, but believe that..."" to show a more balanced view and to make your argument more dynamic. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** The essay suffers from several grammatical mistakes, including punctuation errors, such as unnecessary apostrophes and comma misplacement, which may hinder clear communication. For example, plural words don't require an apostrophe, and mindful comma use can significantly improve sentence flow. Run-on sentences, especially in the conclusion, need to be broken down into simpler sentences to avoid confusing readers. Working on these errors is crucial, as they can impact your score.

3. **Author’s Point of View:** The author's stance is clear, which is a strength of the essay. However, expanding on why productivity and emotional expression through music are viewed as equally important could provide more substance. Incorporating specific examples or personal experiences could also lend more weight to the arguments.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** The essay contains some vivid examples, like the mention of healing music and artists who have spoken about music’s role in their mental health. To further strengthen the essay, focus on developing one or two reasons in depth rather than briefly touching on several. Especially since opposing viewpoints or comparisons are not required, concentrating on elaborating your main arguments will be more effective.

Additionally, to align better with essay expectations, consider rephrasing your introduction to provide a clearer preview of your reasons. In the body paragraphs, be sure to lead with your argument, followed by evidence or examples, and conclude each section by linking back to your main thesis. This structure will help in making your essay more coherent and persuasive.

There has been an increasing number of people who move to urban areas to seek a better living standard; however the life in these cities often brings to inhabitants various hardship situations. The following paragraphs would analazed some problems with some plausible solutions being indicated to tackle this phenomenon. \n It can be undeniable that a large number of migrants travelling to cities could be confronted with different tough situations. To begin with, the cost of living exerts considerable pressure on new inhabitants. Particularly, it is the fact that expenditures spent on daily needs including transports, housing, or gas in a metropolis area are much higher than those in a countryside or small village. Moreover, people travelling from the countryside to economic centres could provoke some public disorders which would be related to the high rate of crimes and poverty. Furthermore, citizens would face environmental degradation which often occurs in most metropolitan areas. Take the polluted air issue as an example, the emission of numerous industrial factories or transports could damage the air quality which may be related to some severe diseases. Another obstacle is a lack of job opportunities due to the overwhelmed migrants, posing a threat to social welfare. \n To avoid this problem worsening, some reasonable steps should be implemented. Firstly, it is highly desirable that governments should invest financial funds in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, it would be a worthwhile idea if politicians launch a vehicle control policy to put a curb on traffic congestions around city centres. Thirdly, it is beneficial for authorities to establish industrial factories, businesses in suburban areas instead of urban regions, helping the suitable labour resources between the countryside and the big cities. \n In conclusion, migrants from underdeveloped regions to developed areas would encounter several hazzard circumstances which require immediate attention.

However, there are areas that warrant improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, the introduction attempts to outline the essay's aim but falls short of providing a clear thesis statement. The phrase ""The following paragraphs would analazed some problems with some plausible solutions being indicated to tackle this phenomenon"" contains a spelling error (analazed should be ""analyzed"") and does not succinctly summarize the key arguments or state the author's position clearly. A more precise thesis statement at the end of the introduction would efficiently set the stage for what follows and clarify the writer's stance on the issue.

Regarding content and development, while the essay introduces several important concerns related to urbanization such as the high cost of living, crime rates, environmental degradation, and unemployment, these topics are more listed than deeply analyzed. Each point introduced would benefit significantly from further elaboration. For example, instead of merely stating the issues, expand on why these issues arise, how they impact the individual and society, and perhaps offer specific examples to illustrate these impacts. This approach would make the argument more persuasive and the discussion more engaging and informative.

Additionally, the essay proposes solutions to the problems mentioned, but these solutions are also briefly discussed. Expanding on how these suggested measures could be implemented, the potential challenges in doing so, and why they are considered effective could strengthen this section. Providing evidence or examples of where similar solutions have been successful would also bolster the argument.

In terms of language and style, attention to spelling and grammar is crucial. The misspelling of ""analyzed"" as ""analazed"" highlights the need for careful proofreading before submission. Furthermore, maintaining consistency in tense and perspective throughout the essay will enhance its readability and professional tone.

The conclusion reiterates the challenges faced by migrants moving to urban areas but could be more impactful by summarizing the proposed solutions and emphasizing the importance of collective effort by government and local authorities. A strong conclusion leaves a lasting impression on the reader and succinctly wraps up the essay's main points.

In summary, focusing on developing a clear thesis statement, expanding on the discussion points with more detailed analysis and examples, addressing solutions more thoroughly, and adhering to grammatical and spelling accuracy will significantly improve the essay. These adjustments will not only clarify the author's viewpoint but also provide a more compelling and persuasive argument.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Informative
4889,https://essayforum.com/writing/trend-buying-things-famous-brands-90005/,dev,IELTS Writing Task 2 about the trend of buying things from famous brands,"An increasing number of individuals tend to purchase outfits, vehicles as well as distinctive things from well-known businesses. This essay will discuss about the causes of the fact and, from my perspective, the trend brings some drawbacks that worth considering. \n To start with, the tendency of paying for globally recognized goods come from the internal values of the brands : the golden quality of their products and customer service. Customers will certainly acquire products that are made from stable and finest materials for long term using. Frequent updates on commodities' appearances and styles also motivate people to willingly spend their cash. The length of warranty for the items bought from worldwide companies is a competitive advantage compared to that from smaller brands. In addition, global enterprises' strategies of taking care of their clients make huge impacts on people's minds while considering where to obtain items from. Customers will be carefully served even before and after their purchase of the goods. For instance, surveys created by the businesses and completed by potential buyers let companies know what goods are the favorite and necessary ones so they can introduce to their consumers in time. Long after patronages shop the items, they will still receive calls to ask for their experience, further assistance if needed or to simply greet them on special occasions. \n On the other hand; consuming commodities from popular brands shows some negatives. Local names with less budget, personnel and other resources to run professional services will find it extremely difficult to compete with worldwide companies and easily disappear from the economy which could lead to the monopoly of global businesses. People, relatively deeply affected by advertisements from dominant brands, can take part in a meaningless race of wasting money and time on unnecessary items to show off their assets and social ranks. \n To sum up, the trend of acquiring goods from famous brands mainly start from their inherent merits of goods' quality and customer service. That brings some disadvantages that needs to be seriously evaluated by both govenrments and inhabitants to prevent potential consequenses.","<quotation>businesses</quotation> \n Wrong reference term.

While you provided a response, not all of it is related to the discussion instruction. You might not pass the test based on the failed scoring parts of this presentation.","The essay addresses the topic of why individuals prefer to purchase items from well-known brands and discusses the implications of this trend. While the core idea is relevant, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and alignment with the essay prompt. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay attempts to tackle the given topic but could benefit from a more direct approach. Instead of saying ""This essay will discuss,"" directly answer the questions posed by the prompt. This will make the introduction more engaging and focused. It's essential to clearly state whether the trend is seen positively or negatively right from the beginning, which helps outline the essay's direction.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the essay is well-written but would benefit from minor corrections and clearer expressions. For instance, ""businesses"" is not exactly the right term when referring to brands; ""manufacturers"" or ""brands"" would be more accurate as they relate directly to the products. Additionally, the essay sometimes uses complex sentences that could be simplified to improve readability. Breaking down complex ideas into shorter sentences could help.

3. **Author's Point of View**: The author's viewpoint is somewhat clear, mentioning that the trend has negative consequences. However, this stance should be more boldly stated at the beginning to guide the reader through the essay. It's crucial to be explicit about seeing the trend as either positive or negative based on the specific prompt.

4. **Arguments and Examples**: The essay provides numerous reasons for people's preference for well-known brands but lacks depth in discussing the consequences of this trend. Focusing on fewer, more detailed examples would strengthen the argument. Try to link your reasons closely to examples that illustrate your point vividly, allowing for a more engaging and convincing argument.

5. **Meeting Essay Requirements**: It's important to adhere closely to the prompt's requirements. The discussion should be tailored to whether the trend is seen as a negative or positive development, providing a focused exploration of this aspect. Instead of broadly discussing the pros and cons, center the essay on how and why the trend could be considered negative or positive, supporting your stance with specific examples and thorough explanation.

In summary, refining the directness of the response to the prompt, simplifying language for clarity, explicitly stating your viewpoint, focusing on in-depth discussion of fewer points, and aligning closer with the essay's instructions will significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the essay.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative
4890,https://essayforum.com/writing/railroads-road-budget-ietls-cambridge-75886/,dev,Railroads vs Road Budget - IETLS CAMBRIDGE 11 TASK 2,"Some people believe that it is a pity if governments spend their budget on improving railways instead of roads as travelling by train is not faster and convenient than driving on our own private vehicle. In my judgement, I personally agree that governments should expenditure more money on railways. There are two reasons for my perspective on this. \n To commence with, railways offer safe commutation for both traders and inhabitants. The reason explains to this safety is that trains can carry numerous passengers and packages on their own railroad, which trigger it to be more securer than road. Additionally, the annual percentage of death level from driving on the road recorded is always higher than that from train. As the result, the safety factor should to be put on top of people's choice when commuting. \n Equally important, rails predispose less damage to environment due to its less consumption in energy. That car, bus, motorbike and many vehicle are the main factor emit a ton of CO2 into the atmosphere annually, which can compares to the inconsiderable amount of train's emission. For instance, the fact that Singapore is one of the most cleanest country owing to its famous train networking called MRT, which encourages that nation's citizens to use less their private vehicles. Consequently, Singapore is free from not only air pollution but also congestion. \n In conclusion, railways offers more benefits to us than roads but the government should take how much they will invest money on rails into account. Besides, they also have certain money on road to ameliorate road standard.","Dear student, you can actually score a 5 with this essay. The strongest part of your essay was your properly developed paraphrasing and opinion statement at the beginning. This good paragraph earned you a pretty decent score in the Task Accuracy portion of the test. It showed a clear understanding of the instructions and also added a unique outline touch by indicating that you will be discussing the reasons supporting your opinion. While the major discussion points had imperfect grammar, there was a clear sense of what you were trying to explain to your reader. However, there were times, such as in the second to the last paragraph when the essay lost focus and thought organization resulting in a lack of overall progression in the discussion. Try to discuss only one reason at a time and do not introduce new information within the same paragraph. A single presentation per paragraph always allows for the best discussion development as the focus of the reader is concentrated on one reason alone. This also allows you to better explain yourself and develop a stronger English presentation. The conclusion was problematic though because it fell short of the required paragraph number (3) and tried to present underdeveloped new ideas as additional discussion points instead of just concluding the essay by using the expected method of a discussion summation and concluding presentation. Anyway, you still did good work since you developed over 260 words for the essay. Way over the 250 minimum requirement. Remember though, each paragraph needs at least 3 sentences to qualify as an academic paragraph. You fell short of that requirement once in this essay.","The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the task, with a well-developed introduction that clearly outlines the reasons supporting the opinion. This strong start helps in establishing a clear point of view, which is crucial for the essay's effectiveness. However, there are several areas where improvements would greatly enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, while the essay does make clear arguments in favor of investing in railways over roads, the presentation of these arguments occasionally struggles due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, phrases like ""expenditure more money on railways"" should be corrected to ""invest more money in railways."" Paying attention to verb tense, word choice, and sentence structure will make the arguments more persuasive and easier to understand.

Furthermore, the essay sometimes loses focus, particularly in the latter sections where new information is introduced without fully developing it. To improve, stick to discussing one main idea per paragraph. This approach keeps the essay organized and makes each point stronger and more coherent. Introducing new ideas should be done with care, ensuring they are fully explored and directly related to the essay's main argument.

The conclusion of the essay merits particular attention. A strong conclusion should summarize the main points without introducing new arguments. The essay attempts to bring in new ideas in the conclusion, which makes it less effective. Reinforcing the main arguments and reiterating the stance on the topic would provide a more solid and satisfying closure.

Additionally, the essay's structure could benefit from adhering to academic standards more closely, such as ensuring each paragraph contains at least three sentences to fully develop an idea.

Finally, it's commendable that the essay exceeds the minimum word count, indicating effort and the ability to produce substantial content. To further improve, focusing on clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy will not only make the essay more readable but will also strengthen the persuasive power of the arguments presented.

By addressing these areas, the essay can become more effective and persuasive, providing a clearer and more cohesive argument in favor of investing in railways over roads.",3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4891,https://essayforum.com/writing/strict-rules-young-people-think-ibt-80547/,dev,Too strict rules for young people? What do you think? - TOEFL IBT,"Even in modern societies, parents or relatives still tend to arrange each and every aspects of young people live from the college they are entering in to the major they select. In my perspective, those kinds of rules are too strict to follow since we have different interests or hobbies from the elderly. Besides, the rules may strongly restrict our development of independent and responsibilities in the future. \n First of all, parents always ask for perfection but overlook the effort young people have made so far. For instance, when I was in senior high school, I was major in Chemistry and even got the outstanding award of Chemistry. During the mid test, I got 90 in that test which was the highest score among the whole class. However, believed that I can do it better, my mom felt unsatisfied and forbidden me to hang out with classmates for fun. For the expectation of the societies, I consider it unreasonable to obey. Moreover, the time making something from excellent to perfect is much more than you imagine. In other words, we can spend the time to learn another thing. \n Secondly, making a choice for young people is a controversial topic too. Parents usually do decisions by their experience and expect that the choice will give you a promising future. To put it into the realistic, some of subjects, such as electronic engineering or computer science, would be greatly recommended for young people to study. Just like an old saying said that ''Interest is the best teacher''. Out of interest, we would keep further academic researching. However, without any interest on it, the studying would be a tedious and repetitious information engrafting process. \n To sum up, making too much choice and asking for the perfection of academic performance, parents' requests are unreasonable. Both of the above examples would obviously restrict the development of adolescents.","Lilo, the discussion is focused on a general perception of rules. Societal rules are not the same as parental rules, which you chose to focus on in your essay. Societal rules have more to do with how one behaves in public and how one deals with his elders or shows respect. It is not part of the rules that your parents have placed upon you. \n Your essay is not focused on the correct discussion, a public society regulation as implemented by societal elders. You are focused on the rules and expectations of your parents and relatives instead. I don't think you can score higher than 2 because of this error. You have response to the task is limited in development which uses incorrect examples for its reasoning. There are also word usage and sentence development errors that all added up to this end result.","The essay presents a clear and personal perspective on the influence of parental and family expectations on youths, particularly regarding life choices and academic achievement. However, the essay appears to address the pressures imposed by parents and relatives rather than rules set by broader society. It is essential to differentiate between societal regulations, which pertain to public behavior and respect towards elders, and the personal rules or expectations set by family members. The focus of the essay diverts from a general discussion on societal norms to a more specific dialogue on familial pressures. 

There are a few areas in the essay that could benefit from improvement, including spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For instance, consider revising phrases for clarity and accuracy, such as ""arrange each and every aspects of young people live"" which might be better expressed as ""arrange every aspect of young people's lives."" Attention to detail, like ensuring verbs agree with their subjects and using the correct tense, can greatly enhance the readability of your essay.

It’s also observed that the argument, while passionate and detailed, could use more structured support. The personal anecdote is compelling, but the essay would benefit from a broader range of examples or evidence to support the claim that parental control can limit a young person’s development of independence and responsibility. 

Additionally, while your viewpoint that parental expectations can sometimes be unreasonable is clear, clarifying this point with more nuanced arguments could strengthen your position. Discussing the balance between guidance and independence might offer a more comprehensive exploration of the topic.

To improve, it would be beneficial to focus on refining your argument to align more closely with the prompt, ensuring it addresses the specified topic. Enhancing the essay's structure, such as organizing it into clear, concise paragraphs that each introduce a new idea, would make your arguments more accessible to the reader. Finally, paying close attention to grammar and style will help in conveying your ideas more effectively.

However, there are several areas that need improvement to make your argument clearer and more structured. Here are some specific points of feedback that can help you improve your essay:

1. **Responding to the Topic**: It's crucial to clearly state the essay question or topic you're responding to at the beginning of your essay. This wasn't apparent in your essay. Make sure your opening paragraph explains the topic and your position (thesis statement) in your own words. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your essay contains several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. These include run-on sentences, missing punctuation, and unclear phrases. Each sentence should express a complete thought and be clearly understandable. Consider breaking long sentences into shorter ones to improve clarity. Additionally, watch out for spelling and ensure proper punctuation.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: While your viewpoint on the negative impact of censoring bad news in the media comes through, it is presented in a somewhat confusing manner. Strive for clarity by distinctly stating your position in the opening paragraph and then reinforcing this viewpoint in each supporting paragraph.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay mentions several reasons to support your viewpoint but these are not clearly or logically presented. To improve, dedicate each body paragraph to discuss a single reason supporting your position. Explain each reason thoroughly, providing examples or evidence to make your argument stronger.

5. **Essay Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a more conventional structure. Aim for:
    - **An opening paragraph** that introduces the topic and your thesis statement.
    - **Three supporting paragraphs**, each focusing on a single argument to back up your thesis. These should be 3-5 sentences long.
    - **A concluding paragraph** that summarizes your main points and restates your position in light of the arguments presented.

Remember, each paragraph should be coherent and focused on a single idea. It's also important that your concluding statement effectively summarizes the discussion without introducing new information.

6. **Review and Practice**: It's advised to review sample essays or writing guides to get familiar with the desired structure and presentation of an essay. This will provide a clearer understanding of how to effectively organize and express your thoughts within the given format.

By focusing on these aspects, you can significantly improve your essay. Remember, practice is key to developing your writing skills.",2,3,1,3,2,2,2,3,2,1,Argumentative

While some might argue that it is not appropriate to the pupils' learnings, I personally would agree with the idea that uncharged service is beneficial to both society and individuals. \n In terms of the reasons why people turn down to the uncharged service conducted by children, it might attribute to the following factors. Firstly, with the limitation of time, it could be difficult for children to strike a balance between the charitable program and the assignments form schools. And then, because under-aged students do not know so well about how to tackle the problems appropriately, some community engagements could be hard to accomplish sometimes. \n Yet there are some advantages if the unpaid service for public has been done.

However, there are several areas where this essay can be improved for clarity, coherence, and task adherence. Following are specific points to consider:

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay does not fully adhere to the prescribed task of discussing a single opinion throughout. Instead, it attempts to cover contrasting views before stating a personal stance, which diverges from the requirement to focus solely on defending one viewpoint throughout the essay. To improve, revisit the essay prompt and ensure your essay is dedicated to explaining and supporting one clear opinion from the beginning to the end.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few spelling errors (""uncharged"" should be ""unpaid,"" ""wet"" should be ""went""), grammatical mistakes, and awkward phrasing (""assignments form schools"" should be ""assignments from schools,"" and ""outdo"" should be ""outweigh"") throughout the essay. Always proofread your essay to correct such errors, ensuring your argument is conveyed clearly and professionally. Consider simplifying complex sentences to aid comprehension and correctness.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: While your personal viewpoint emerges towards the end, the initial ambiguity and the discussion of contrasting opinions make your stance less impactful. Start with a clear thesis statement in your introduction that reflects your opinion, and maintain this focus throughout. This will make your essay more persuasive and coherent.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: The essay provides examples and reasons, but some arguments lack specificity or relevancy to the core topic. For instance, the anecdote about volunteering at an animal shelter, though interesting, veers off-topic from the main discussion about the impact of unpaid service in high school programs. Focus on providing clear, relevant examples that directly support your thesis. This includes discussing how unpaid service benefits student development and society in ways closely tied to the educational context.

5. **Overall Structure and Coherence**: Aim for a more structured argument by clearly delineating your essay into introduction, body, and conclusion. Each paragraph should introduce a single idea supported by examples or evidence, leading logically to the next. This structure will enhance the readability and persuasiveness of your essay.

In summary, to strengthen your essay, refine its focus to maintain a consistent point of view, address grammatical and spelling issues, clarify your argument with relevant examples, and improve its overall structure.

To enhance the essay, consider the following feedback focusing on the response to the topic, spelling, grammar, stylistic issues, clarity in point of view, and the quality of arguments provided.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears the essay slightly missed the focus of the original prompt. A successful essay should clearly address the required discussion points, offering a balanced view while integrating personal opinion. The suggested approach involves discussing the journey of knowledge from ancient to contemporary times, considering both the contributions of ancient civilizations and the intellectual achievements of modern times. This way, the argument becomes more aligned with the prompt, ensuring a stronger stance in your discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are a few areas for improvement in spelling, grammar, and style. For example, watch out for spaces after punctuation marks (e.g., ""others don't agree .I"" should be ""others don't agree. I"") and be mindful of correct punctuation usage (""However;"" should be ""However,""). Also, consider using more varied sentence structures to enhance readability and flow.

3. **Clarity in Point of View:** Your point of view emerges in the essay, but could be made more explicit. Clearly stating your personal stance early on helps guide the reader through your discussion. Proposing a structured format, such as introducing the topic, presenting both sets of beliefs (the importance of ancient contributions vs. the intellectual accomplishments of the modern era), and articulating your opinion before summarizing, could strengthen your argument and ensure your viewpoint is unmistakable.

4. **Quality of Arguments:** While you provide examples of ancient innovations and modern technological advancements, further development of these arguments could reinforce your position. Offering more detailed descriptions, comparisons, and analysis not only illustrates your points more vividly but also demonstrates a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Discussing the significance of ancient contributions in relation to modern achievements can present a more comprehensive argument, showcasing the interconnectedness of past and present knowledge.

In conclusion, focusing on directly addressing the prompt, refining spelling and grammar, clarifying your viewpoint, and deepening your arguments can significantly improve the overall quality of your essay.

I completely agree with this view and will give my reasons below. \n The first reason is that children learn a foreign language more efficiently. According to biology theory, human brains are developing at younger ages, which means it allows children to absorb a large amount of new information in a short time. Therefore, children at primary school ages are equipped with enough amount of vocabulary and grammar well preparing for the next advanced courses when entering secondary school. \n The second reason is that it broadens their horizon more. Most younger people are less self-conscious and more open-minded to adopt novel concepts. Besides, it is unavoidable that when we learn other countries' languages, we also learn about their cultures at the same time. Hence, if people contact a variety of knowledge from their young age, they will have less chance to reject learning unfamiliar things when they grow up. \n However, it is true that there still are some disadvantages. One of the problems is that it easily causes confusion in younger learners when they are learning a mother tongue and a second language together. I think this can be made up by well trained teachers. Teachers in primary schools are qualified and know how to correct their students through a series of designed materials and methods. \n In conclusion, I believe that starting learning a foreign language at primary shcool age instead of secondary shool age has more benefits for children.","The question is not whether you agree or disagree. The question is whether you believe advantages outweigh the disadvantages. So this is not a comparison essay. This is a single opinion defense discussion. This is accomplished by allowing the writer to mention a perceived advantage as the topic paragraph of the reasoning paragraph, only to explain why this is actually a disadvantage in the end. So the format is: \n Sentence 1: Advantage / disadvantage topic (Depends upon what stance you have taken in the response paraphrase) \n Sentence 2: Why this is seen as an advantage / disadvantage \n Sentence 3: Why it isn't a true advantage / disadvantage \n Sentence 4: Example to support the claim \n Sentence 5: Additional supporting sentence or transition sentence into the next paragraph discussion topic \n The second reasoning paragraph should follow the same format. The conclusion should be longer than just a single sentence. The format is always 3-5 sentences per paragraph, regardless of whether it is a paraphrase, reason, or concluding paragraph. While you did write more than the required minimum, you have to understand that if you do not present the expected discussion, based on the instruction, the essay will have a hard time getting a passing score. Specially since there are existing spelling and grammar errors in your presentation, both of which will lower the final score of the presentation along with the lower TA score.","Your essay presents a clear viewpoint in favor of starting foreign language education in primary school, rather than in secondary school, which directly addresses the essay question. However, to improve alignment with the task instructions and enhance the effectiveness of your argument, consider the following feedback:

1. **Essay Response to Topic:** While your essay does address the idea of whether introducing a second language in primary school is beneficial, it's crucial to frame your arguments to explicitly discuss why the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, rather than merely agreeing with a viewpoint. The task requires a deeper analysis, focusing on presenting advantages as primary discussion points and then addressing potential disadvantages within the same context.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are a few spelling errors (“shcool” instead of “school”) that need correction. Be vigilant about proofreading your work to catch these errors. Additionally, paying attention to grammar, such as the proper use of articles (“the human brain” instead of “human brains”), could enhance clarity. For style, aim for variety in sentence structures to make your essay more engaging to the reader.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your standpoint is evident, which is a strength of your essay. However, reinforcing your point of view with a structured argumentative strategy could make it even more persuasive. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence, followed by an explanation, an example to support your claim, and a concluding or transitional sentence leading to the next point.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your essay presents arguments in favor of early language learning, such as the efficiency of children learning languages and the broadening of their horizons. Enhancing these arguments with specific examples and addressing counterarguments directly would strengthen your position. For example, when mentioning the potential confusion of learning two languages, directly counter this by discussing methods to mitigate such issues, supported by evidence or examples.

5. **Essay Structure and Coherence:** Aim to expand your conclusion to more than a single sentence, summarizing your key points and reinforcing the significance of your argument. This not only provides closure to your essay but also strengthens the impact of your discussion. Remember the suggested format: introduce your point, provide reasoning, counter any perceived disadvantages, support with examples, and conclude or transition smoothly.

Incorporating these suggestions will not only address the task more directly but will also enhance the overall quality, coherence, and persuasiveness of your essay. Remember, clarity, relevance to the task, and a well-structured argument are key to a successful essay.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Although the trend gives students life-transforming opportunities, there still exist many limitations. \n On the one hand, there are numerous advantages of studying overseas. First, living in a new country could allow students to explore new cultures. They can experience exotic foods, customs and atmospheres, which helps them to have a better understanding and appreciation of the nation's people and history. Second, studying overseas gives international students more career opportunities after finishing their study program. They return to their country with language skills and a great education, which is very attractive to employers. \n On the other hand, studying overseas is not without downsides. First, although international students could contact their family and friends by using video chat applications such as facetime and skype, they do experience loneliness at some stage. For example, there are always occasions when international students miss their family, especially during holidays such as Christmas and New year, as these are seasons of spending time with family and of sharing, caring and giving. Second, fees and living costs are popular financial troubles students have to cope with. The expenses of studying abroad tend to be higher than studying locally, and even if students budget well, they can run out of money. \n In conclusion, given the clear advantages studying overseas have, there are still disadvantages. Students should deliberate carefully the pros and cons of both sides before making the decision of whether or not they should study in a foreign country.","Do, your opening statement doesn't really provide an accurate depiction of the original prompt requirement. As an examiner, I would be looking for the following information in your work: (1) the original topic for discussion; (2) whether your personal opinion is required in the discussion (3) what the discussion outline is going to be. Compare the requirements for an effective opening statement and you will see that you are failing to respond to at least 2 of the requirements. Therefore, your opening statement will drag down the score for your essay. \n While I will not fault your acceptable discussions in paragraphs 2 and 3, you could have made these paragraphs stronger by opting to discuss and develop only one reason instead of presenting a number of reasons whose justification became limited within the paragraph. It is important to focus on single evidence discussions so that you can create more complex sentences because you have the time and the space to properly develop the discussion paragraphs. \n I have to comment on your fourth paragraph. The closing paragraph is not acceptable as it does not provide the expected information for the concluding paragraph. There is no proper summation of the discussion using the restated prompt, points of discussion, and your opinion (if needed), all of which are required elements of a strong closing statement.","Your essay on studying overseas explores the advantages and disadvantages of this growing trend. This is a good topic as it allows for a balanced discussion. However, there are some areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and adherence to the essay task. Let’s go through the main aspects that could help enhance your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears that your opening statement does not fully align with the typical requirements of an effective introduction for an essay of this type. An introduction should clearly state the topic, whether a personal opinion is expected, and a brief outline of what the essay will cover. It’s crucial to revisit your opening to ensure it accurately sets up the discussion and meets these criteria, as this is vital for guiding the reader and setting the context for your arguments.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Overall, your grammar and spelling are commendable, which makes your essay easy to read. However, focusing on creating more complex sentences, particularly when discussing a single point in detail, could introduce variety and depth to your writing. This is not just about sophistication but about making your arguments clearer and more engaging.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your essay does a good job of presenting a balanced view of studying overseas, detailing both the advantages and disadvantages. To strengthen your essay, ensure that your conclusion effectively synthesizes these points rather than merely restating them. If your assignment requires a personal opinion, make sure it is clearly stated and supported in your conclusion.

4. **Descriptive and Clear Arguments:** While you present multiple reasons both for and against studying abroad, deeper exploration of fewer points might serve you better than briefly mentioning many. This approach would allow you to provide more evidence and analysis for each point, making your arguments stronger and more persuasive. Choosing one reason from each side to explore in depth could also give you the opportunity to showcase your ability to develop complex arguments and use more varied sentence structures.

**Final Thoughts:** Aim to refine your introduction and conclusion to better meet the expectations for these critical components of your essay. Reworking these parts to include a clear outline of your essay's structure, a restatement of the discussion points, and your personal conclusion, if required, would significantly improve the coherence and impact of your essay. Also, consider diving deeper into a select few points rather than skimming the surface of many. This targeted approach will allow you to demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skills, which are key to a successful argumentative essay.

By addressing these areas, your essay could become more effective in communicating your viewpoint and more engaging for your readers. Remember, clarity and depth in your arguments are essential for a compelling essay.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4897,https://essayforum.com/writing/celebrities-glamour-wealth-may-lead-negative-81519/,dev,Celebrities' glamour and wealth may lead to negative example for young people,"Nowadays, an increasing number of people become celebrities because of their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements. However, while I agree that it has a negative impact on a teenager, I believe that some celebrities still act as a role model. \n On the one hand, there are various reasons why people may argue that some celebrities are a bad example for young people. First of all, celebrities become popular due to their fancy, wealth and glamorous lifestyles instead of outstanding achievement so that teenagers envies and desire those lifestyles, which becomes a negative influence on the teenager. Another reason is that the celebrities are not only acting talents below the average compared others celebrities, but also showing something which is not useful to teenagers with a bright future, and therefore this makes sensation to the public. For example, A CROWD group, two young YouTuber Jian-Neon and Andy, who are a couple in Taiwan, always post videos which shows mischief less of their acting. Finally, celebrities' hedonistic lifestyles negatively influence young people because this may cause that young people to ""enjoy their life"" instead of hard work. \n On the other hand, the negatively influence arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, movie or sports stars become celebrities through incredible acts and outstanding performance, which plays an important role model and has a positive impact on a teenager. Secondly, if celebrities have strong determination and hard work to get a masterpiece of article creative, they would be recognized by the public and obtain great achievements. An example is that a director from an act is Amir Khan, who has become a world famous Bollywood celebrity through his inspirational and creative movies instead of his wealth or attractive personality. Finally, celebrities have creativity, innovation, and abilities can inspire adolescents, even changing in their life for good. \n In conclusion, although celebrities' glamour and wealth may lead to negative example to young people, from my point of view, I wholeheartedly agree that some celebrities who have outstanding performance would have a positive impact on adolescents.","Dear student, there are two problems with this essay, The first, is your response to the prompt requirement. The second, is the lack of clarity in your discussions. Let's address these problems one at a time below. \n The prompt paraphrase is asking you to deliver a measured response to the agree or disagree statement. The error lies in the following: \n <em>Original question : To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?<br/>Your Response: ... while I agree that it has a negative impact on a teenager, I believe that some celebrities still act as a role model.<br/><br/>Appropriate Response: I partially agree with the aforementioned statement due to several reasons.</em> \n The measured response is important because it shows the examiner that you know how to use ""emotional"" words to describe your opinion. Based on your original statement, it appears that you have a measured, half and half opinion of the given statement which is why I formatted the more appropriate response in the aforementioned manner. \n Now, let's address the clarity problem in your discussion. \n Your second paragraph sounds like a badly translated presentation of a paragraph that was originally written in your native tongue. It is obvious that you were thinking in a different language and then using English alternative words as you know these to be, without consideration of the proper word usage and how it applies to the statement you wish to make. Hence the confusing presentation of ideas in this paragraph. You need to work on sentence clarity, That can only be achieved by having you familiarize yourself with more English words and its correct meaning for proper application to your paragraphs. \n Now, while using examples that are familiar to you help to illustrate your meaning, when your reasoning sentences are problematic and not easily understandable, presenting country specific examples that may not be familiar to the examiner will not help your essay. It is best to use generalized examples for that part so that the examiner can develop a better idea of what you are trying to say.","The essay provides an interesting take on the influence of celebrities on young people, touching on both the negative and positive aspects. However, there are areas that need improvement to make the essay more effective and aligned with the essay prompt. Let’s discuss these areas in detail.

Firstly, it's crucial to directly address the essay topic. The prompt asks to what extent you agree or disagree with the statement. Your response should reflect a measured opinion, for example, stating directly how much you agree or disagree. You mentioned, “while I agree that it has a negative impact on a teenager, I believe that some celebrities still act as a role model.” A clearer response would be to state if your agreement or disagreement is partial, complete, or to a certain extent, providing a balanced view right from the start.

Secondly, clarity in your arguments and discussions can be improved. There are moments in the essay where the sentences are complex and the ideas are not fully clear. This could be due to thinking in another language and then translating those thoughts into English. It's beneficial to practice thinking and structuring your sentences directly in English to avoid confusion. Also, aim for simplicity and precision in your wording to convey your points more effectively.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are a few areas to focus on:
- Watch out for run-on sentences and try to break them into shorter, more digestible parts.
- Be mindful of verb tense consistency throughout the essay.
- Pay attention to article usage (""a,"" ""an,"" and ""the"") as it can change the meaning of your sentences.

Your point of view in the essay is apparent, but reinforcing it with more coherent arguments could strengthen your position. When providing examples, ensure they are clear and potentially recognizable to a broad audience. While it is good to draw from personal or familiar examples, ensure they are presented in a way that anyone can understand their relevance to your argument without needing specific cultural knowledge.

Lastly, your essay could benefit from more concrete and relatable examples to support your views. When discussing negative influences of celebrities, providing general examples that are widely known could make your argument stronger. Similarly, when highlighting positive celebrity influences, choose examples that clearly demonstrate their admirable qualities or achievements.

In summary, your essay has a strong foundation, but focusing on direct response to the prompt, clarity of arguments, grammatical accuracy, and using relatable examples will significantly enhance its effectiveness. Keep practicing, and remember to structure your thoughts clearly and simply for your readers.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Firstly, there are some buildings that have unique structures or special layouts. These building attract a lot of people's attention, arouse their curiosity. Secondly, there also some buildings that celebrities or famous people used to live in. Hence, some people want to visit and find out why their favorite person chose to live there. Thirdly, many people want to make sure that their houses or buildings are the safe places which they can live in. For instance, owners can list out some floods or typhoons that might effect their buildings so they can design some suitable structures minimizing the affects of disasters. \n Buyers will have multiple methods of searching for the background of the house such as asking people who used to live there for a long time ago: grandparents, neighborhoods, owners of the houses or even the sellers. But the sellers may not provide some disadvantage information about the house just to sell it easily. For some well-known or historic ones, we can research on books, newspapers or internet. In this technological age, it s not difficult to search for everything you need by Internet. \n In conclusion, society is interested in finding out the history of the buiding because they want to make sure that the place they choose to live is safe.

The methods by which people may research the history of a building are also helpfully outlined, stressing the utility of both direct conversations with knowledgeable individuals and the use of modern technological resources.

To further enhance this essay, consider incorporating a more explicit introduction that succinctly summarizes your main points and establishes a clear stance on the topic. This will not only give readers a glimpse of what to expect but also demonstrate a strong grasp of the subject matter from the outset.

It's also important to maintain a consistent use of present tense throughout the essay to reflect the current relevance and accessibility of the research methods discussed. For example, instead of saying ""Buyers will have multiple methods of searching,"" it might be more effective to say, ""Buyers have multiple methods of searching.""

While the essay successfully identifies why people are interested in the history of buildings and the methods available for such inquiries, ensure that each reason and method directly responds to the initial discussion prompt. This alignment with the prompt is fundamental for demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the task at hand.

Additionally, although the essay is largely coherent and logically structured, paying attention to slight grammatical and stylistic improvements could further refine the writing. For instance, addressing minor errors such as ""effect"" instead of ""affect"" or inserting commas for better readability would elevate the overall quality.

Ultimately, the essay does a commendable job of elucidating people's growing interest in historical research related to buildings.

4899,https://essayforum.com/writing/famous-93647/,dev,(IELTS WRITING TASK 2) Famous for being famous,"In the modern world where celebrity culture is pervasive and slowly becoming the norm in highly developed metropolitan areas, there is a phenomenon, decried by traditionalists as ""superficial and harmful"", that is ""famous for being famous"". In other words, this means the state of being well-known, sometimes internationally, not for one's accomplishments but for publicity stunts and associations with the celebrity world. Personally, I have a balanced and nuanced view on whether this has a negative influence on younger generations. \n First and foremost, being famous for one's glamour, wealth and personal connections might overemphasize the importance of one's outward appearance over inner strengths and talents. This can lead people astray as beauty fades and one's contributions to the society are what truly last and make an impact. Moreover, to always maintain a presentable exterior, portray a larger-than-life personality and lead a lavish lifestyle requires a lot of resources which are usually not sustainable and accessible to the aspiring youngsters. Therefore, the extra borrowing to cover the costs might plunge these individuals into financial and emotional distress. \n However, celebrity status, regardless of whether that comes from achievements or stunts, does confer benefits to holders of such status and is indicative of the greater, overarching society. It is common knowledge that viral Instagrammers or Hollywood socialites are now earning 6-figure amounts for each post on social media. In addition, the fame and social connections which follow, more often than not, compensate for the initial investments and bring long-term non-monetary benefits, such as finding a wealthy spouse or wielding political power. These unsaid and unwritten bonuses are also driving forces behind the celebrity culture in many economic, financial and cultural centers of the world today. \n In summary, I believe that the state of being a celebrity, even without personal excellence, provides tremendous benefits for status holders. This explains the current trend of ""famous for being famous"" that is prevalent across social media and global metropolises. \n (Start: 9:34, end: 10:01, 4 October 2022, total time: 27 minutes, 324 words) \n Cao Nguyên Cường","Scoring is a private service that you will have to contact me for via the email address listed below.

However, there are several areas that could significantly improve the effectiveness and compliance of your essay with the typical requirements of English proficiency tests. Here’s how you can enhance your essay:

1. **Adherence to the Prompt:**
   The instruction usually requires you to take a clear stance or present a single opinion on the issue. Your essay, while thoughtful, presents a balanced view rather than choosing one side decisively. It’s important for scoring purposes to directly address the prompt by providing a singular opinion on whether the celebrity culture's influence is positive or negative. Consider re-evaluating the essay prompt and focusing your argument more narrowly on either the benefits or harms of the celebrity culture, rather than both.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   While your essay is largely well-written, attention to detail can enhance its readability and professionalism. Pay close attention to the correct use of punctuation, and make sure every sentence is complete and concise. Also, varying sentence structure can make your argument more engaging. Additionally, ensure all words are spelled correctly and used in the appropriate context to maintain the essay's credibility.

3. **Clarity of Author’s Point of View:**
   Your point of view seems to oscillate between the pros and cons of the celebrity culture, which may confuse readers about your ultimate stance on the issue. For a stronger essay, it's essential to assert a clear viewpoint early on and consistently support that perspective throughout your discussion. This will not only make your essay more persuasive but also easier to follow.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   While your essay introduces valid points about the effects of celebrity culture, expanding on these with more specific examples, data, or hypothetical scenarios could strengthen your argument. For instance, when discussing the financial and emotional distress caused by aspiring to a celebrity lifestyle, providing real-life examples or statistical data could make your argument more compelling. Similarly, if discussing the benefits of celebrity culture, detail how these benefits counteract the negatives in a more focused manner relevant to your chosen stance.

Remember, specificity is key in making your essay stand out. It's not only about presenting an opinion but also about justifying it with clear, concrete evidence. By refining your approach to directly respond to the task, clarifying your position, ensuring linguistic accuracy, and deploying strong, supported arguments, your essay will not only meet the requirements more closely but also become a more powerful piece of writing.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

You are using comma's throughout the essay instead of placing periods in strategic positions within the paragraph. You have mistaken long sentences, composed of different ideas, but connected by commas, as complex sentences. While I can understand why that happened, the reality is that complex sentences are composed of one semi-long sentence, that conveys a descriptive thought in the given sentence. It is not composed of different ideas, strewn together by commas. These mistakes in sentence development and presentation will result a score of 3 at the most for your GRA band. \n Your TA score will also suffer point deductions due to the inappropriate formatting of your prompt paraphrase. The prompt paraphrase is meant to help the examiner measure your English comprehension ability. How well did you understand the question and, does your response to the question fit the given task? In this case, your answer was partially correct. Your paraphrase of the prompt does not really come across as accurate, and your thesis statement does not respond directly to the question posed. Mostly because you decided to compare and contrast when a singular opinion response was all that was required in the thesis statement. This could have been better presented as: \n <em>These days, people have been known to have canine and feline playmates. Some people believe that the advantages of such a set up is more beneficial than non-beneficial to these people. There are several reasons why this could be considered a beneficial relationship.</em> \n Note how the actual prompt was paraphrased by using similar in meaning words (synonyms). By using synonyms, you are able to showcase your vocabulary skills in a manner that shows your ability to use several descriptive words for the same meaning: \n Canine = Dog \n Feline = Cat \n Companion - playmate \n Advantages - beneficial \n Disadvantages - non- beneficial \n By using different words that hold the same meaning, you increase your possibility at a higher LR score which, at the moment, due to your mistakes in spelling throughout the essay (Altough = Although, fell = feel, couses = causes) can only score another 3 in the LR bracket. You have limited control over word formation which often does not convey a meaning to the word that you wrote that is immediately obvious to the reader. Please take the time to edit and revise your paper prior to submission. \n Your C&C score, I believe, cannot score higher than a 3 either because you do not show the ability to develop coherent and cohesive paragraphs. You are tying together different reasonings, without really developing an explanation for these, within a single paragraph. It would be best for you to practice the 1 topic per paragraph with a 3-5 sentence explanation, inclusive of an example, in order to help you create more understandable statements. Use the 3 body paragraph format to present your ideas. For this essay I suggest the following format: \n 1. Reason 1 - subject sentence, reason, example \n 2. Reason 2 - subject sentence, reason, example \n 3. Reason 3 - subject sentence, reason, example (optional but suggested for increased scoring potential) \n By using the above format, you would have been able to better address each benefit of having pets for companions, without confusing the reader and causing undue stress because of the lack of explanation coming from you regarding the reasons you listed. You would also do well to use transition words and sentences in order to prepare your reader for the change in discussion for the next paragraph to be presented. \n By the way, don't mention any figures or information that is exclusive to your country. The Task 2 Essay deals with general information so your presentation should also be general in approach. That will show how familiar you are with various discussion topics. If you have omitted the mention of the amount of security fees, your essay would have been better off as it would have remained in a general ""global"" tone instead. \n Try to develop a 3 sentence concluding summary that depicts all of the topic sentences and pertinent reasons from your body paragraphs. That is the purpose of the concluding paragraph. It allows you to repeat the information, in a differently worded manner in order to show the reviewer that you have the skills with which to explain yourself in different forms in English. A well developed opening and closing paraphrased paragraph will result in a higher TA score for the test taker.","The essay provided has several strong points and areas that can be improved upon to better address the topic and improve clarity for the reader. Here are specific points of feedback:

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay aims to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of pet ownership, stating that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. This is a good start, but the thesis statement and overall argument could be clearer. To improve, the introduction should briefly mention the reasons that will be discussed, using synonyms to showcase vocabulary. For example, instead of ""Many people keep dogs and cats as companions,"" consider ""Numerous individuals have canine and feline companions.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: The essay contains several punctuation errors, especially the overuse of commas and incorrect word choices (e.g., ""Altough"" instead of ""Although,"" ""fell"" for ""feel,"" ""couses"" for ""causes""). These mistakes make the essay hard to follow. Periods should be used to end statements, and complex sentences should only contain closely related ideas. Always check your writing to correct these errors before submission.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your position on the topic becomes evident in the conclusion, but it is somewhat confused throughout the essay. To clarify, consistently express your stance in each paragraph and use examples to support your viewpoint. This will help the reader understand your perspective from the beginning.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The arguments provided are a mix of advantages and disadvantages of pet ownership, but they lack detailed development and examples. Using a structure of one reason per paragraph with a subject sentence, explanation, and specific example can strengthen each point. For instance, when discussing pet ownership costs, mention not only the expenses but also compare them to alternatives in a more general sense without specifying exact amounts, to maintain a global perspective.

Additionally, consider the coherence and cohesion of your essay. Transition words and variety in sentence structures can greatly improve the flow of your writing.

The reason why people are attracted by smartphone is that social media are already on this device. With the internet connection, it's possible for us to chat or even video call with people, which is much more vivid than normal boring phones just for calling. Moreover, we can post our memorable photos, tell people our stories or even record our daily habits, hobbies and share it with billions of people. \n Secondly, by using smartphone,we can satisfy our thirsty for knowledge. The greatest feature of smartphone is search tool. It gives us a notice of the hottest issues such as pandemic virus, conflict among countries,etc through thowsands of up-to-date news.

It is difficult to review the essay because of the missing writing instructions. For now, only a general review of your grammar can be provided. \n Try to write more than just the minimum word count. 275 words would be a better word count for your essay as opposed to 251. The examiner will need to have more samples of your writing style and expression in order to better judge your ability to write in the English language. Right now, you are not writing to your full capacity because you are limiting your writing presentation in terms of your thought process and ability to form sentences / paragraphs.

However, there are several areas where improvements can enhance both the clarity and strength of the argument presented.

1. **Response to Topic**: While it seems the essay aims to discuss the positive impacts of smartphones, without the original prompt, it's difficult to fully assess alignment. Assuming the topic is about technological advancements improving life, focusing more on contrasting views and providing a balanced perspective could strengthen the argument. Expanding the essay to discuss more about specific examples or personal experiences could make the argument more compelling.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few spelling mistakes (""advices"" should be ""advances"", ""Athough"" should be ""Although"", ""nagative"" should be ""negative"", ""thowsands"" should be ""thousands"") that need correction. Also, using the correct form of words/phrases improves the formal tone of your essay—use ""cannot"" instead of ""can not"", and avoiding contractions such as changing ""It's"" to ""It is"" adheres to academic writing standards. Remember, in a formal essay, it's important to maintain consistent and correct usage of language.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay clearly supports the view that smartphones have beneficial impacts on our quality of life. This point of view is consistent throughout the essay. To make it even clearer, consider introducing contrasting viewpoints briefly before explaining why you favor the positive aspects. This approach can show critical thinking and understanding of the topic's complexity.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments provided support the positive view on smartphones, focusing on connectivity and access to information. Enhancing these arguments with more detailed examples, data, or personal experiences can make your statements more vivid and convincing. Considering adding specific benefits or citing studies/research can strengthen your position.

**Conclusion Improvement**: The conclusion could be more effective by better summarizing key points made, restating the topic, and offering a closing thought that echoes the essay's main argument. Consider structuring your conclusion to include these elements to provide a coherent end to your essay.

Lastly, aiming for a slightly longer essay, around 275 words, could give more room to express ideas more fully and demonstrate writing abilities more effectively. Addressing these areas will not only improve the quality of this essay but also enhance writing skills for future assignments.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4902,https://essayforum.com/writing/part-countries-traditional-celbrations-88511/,dev,Writing IELTS PART 2: MOST COUNTRIES HAVE TRADITIONAL CELBRATIONS THAT OCCUR ANNUALLY...,"Tradition is a belief, behavior, and custom inherited from the past, which either has symbolic meanings or significant importance to society. Therefore, a great deal of traditional events is celebrated annually around the globe. However, the more modern our world becomes, the more these special festivals degenerated. This problem can obliterate the many benefits traditional celebrations have brought about to one's society. \n Celebrations of culture provide individuals a sense of identity. They not only answer the question of citizens' origins but they also remind citizens of what or who have shaped their lives. The people in my country, Vietnam, for instance, take great importance in celebrating the Hung King Temple festival. In this special event, everyone will commemorate Hung Kings-the founder of the Vietnam nation and after that, getting involved in a diversity of folk games such as bamboo swing, rice cooking competitions, or lion dance. Vietnamese people are reminded that owing to Hung Kings' efforts and labors, they are able to lead a well-of life in this day and age. \n Another sizeable value of cultural celebrations is that they educate us on things like freedom and benevolence, and help us pass on our cultural or religious history. In this aspect, Vietnamese people have Giong Festival, which is to commemorate Saint Giong, one of the four Vietnamese immortals. This event helps us remember the heroin battle of Saint Giong and his people, Van Lang, against foreign enemies in order to protect Vietnamese's freedom and rights. \n To summarize, no matter how diverse traditional celebrations are, they all serve the same purpose: being the underpinning of one's society. Thus, disregarding them can bring about severe problems and disadvantages.","There was no need to define traditions at the start of this essay. It actually did not help your presentation because you added information rather than simply restating the original topic and discussion points. The first paragraph for this essay should have only covered: \n Sentence 1: Restated topic (in your own words using synonyms) \n Sentence 2: Reason for the discussion \n Sentence 3: Your opinion indicating the benefits of traditions for societies \n The original prompt always tells you how many sentences to write. Count the representations. In this case, the original prompt shows: \n - Topic (traditions) \n - Reference ( occurs annually) \n - Discussion ( opinion about benefits) \n As I showed you above, you have to outline the discussion first. Analyze how the discussion should be presented per paragraph before you start typing. Outlining and drafting the content are very important to the TA scoring section. \n You did a very good job in the discussion presentation. Each paragraph has a clear topic sentence, reason, example, and supporting statements. All of which helped to create a properly developed paragraph. You should score well in the C&C section because of the efficiency of your discussion. \n In the conclusion. You should not have changed the discussion instruction from the original presentation. By saying there can be severe problems and disadvantages, you are not properly representing the reverse paraphrase. You need to simply restate the discussion points from the original prompt and your opinion presentation to complete the concluding presentation. The problems with your introduction and conclusion will work together to lower your TA score. So your final score may not be as high as it can be because the TA score will start off at a lower score than previously expected.","Your essay provides an insightful discussion on the importance of traditions in society, particularly focusing on the Vietnamese cultural celebrations. Your examples effectively illustrate how traditions offer a sense of identity and teach values, thereby enriching your argument. Let's go through some points to make your essay even stronger.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your introduction of the topic by defining tradition was an interesting approach. However, it's essential to directly connect to the essay question from the beginning. A more effective start might restate the topic using synonyms, outline the reason for discussing it, and present your opinion on the benefits of traditions. By refining your introduction to follow this structure, you'll create a more focused argument right from the start.

2. **Content and Cohesion**: You've done an excellent job in structuring the body of your essay. Each paragraph presents clear topic sentences, examples, and supporting statements, contributing to well-developed arguments. This coherence and the clear progression of ideas highlight the strengths of your discussion.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your essay is well-written with a clear point of view. Although there were no significant spelling or grammar issues, paying attention to sentence structure for improved readability can make your essay even better. Short, clear sentences can sometimes convey your point more powerfully than longer, complex ones.

4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion ties back to the argument's essence but introduces a slightly new idea regarding the potential problems of disregarding traditions. While it's crucial to summarize the discussion points and your stance on the topic, ensure that the conclusion directly reflects the discussions without adding new arguments or changing the focus. Restating your main points and your opinion will reinforce your argument for the reader.

Remember, outlining your essay before writing and directly addressing the prompts can significantly enhance the clarity and impact of your discussion. Your essay is on a strong path, with rich examples and a clear understanding of the topic. With a few adjustments for more direct topic engagement and a focused conclusion, your essay will be even more compelling. Keep up the excellent work!",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4903,https://essayforum.com/writing/digital-traditional-newspapers-80026/,dev,IELTS - The digital and traditional newspapers,"It is true that there has been an increasing number of people considering the Internet a better place to find information when compared to newspapers. I myself strongly believe that as this trend continues, the Internet will soon be as important as the tradition press. \n On the one hand, I agree that newspapers will remain as a vital source of information, and will not be completely overwhelmed by the Internet. Firstly, newspapers have always been the most traditional way of catching up on news, and almost everyone prefers having something to hold on their hands when reading to straining their eyes on screens. Also, as the presses hire professional editors and journalists, newspapers are always more reliable and trustworthy when compares to the articles on the Internet. \n However, there is a wide range of reason to believe that the Internet will soon be as popular as newspapers. One main reason is that the Internet always offers people with faster access to regularly updated news when compared to the tradition presses which are published only once or twice per day. Additionally, people can easily share their viewpoints and opinions on ongoing events and ague with others. To illustrate, in recent years, many a person has joined Medium - a forum where members write to share stories that matter them and others are allowed to comment directly on the posts. \n In summary, it is absurd to argue that the Internet will never be as popular as newspapers. While newspaper's importance might remain unchanged, the online sources of information will soon be equally important.","@hyperephania this is not an extent essay response so a simple agreement or disagreement will suffice. In addition to that, since this is an ""or"" essay, you are expected to pick only one side of the discussion to fully defend in your overall presentation. This is not a comparison essay, which would have been indicated by the instruction ""discuss both points of view"". Unless you see that instruction in the original prompt, the essay discussion is always presented in the singular point of view. \n That being said, your essay will be considered only partially correct in response because of the prompt deviation on your part. The deviation is an alteration of your response in reference to the original instructions for the discussion. Since this is singular response essay, you will get a score only for the part that coincides with the sentiment you presented in the thesis statement as part of your prompt paraphrase. Therefore, it is more than likely that you will not receive a passing score for this essay in an actual test.","The essay provides an interesting perspective on the debate between the importance and popularity of newspapers versus the Internet as sources of information. However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to enhance the overall effectiveness and alignment with expected essay-writing standards for proficiency tests.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to discuss both sides of the argument concerning the Internet and newspapers as sources of information. However, for proficiency tests, it's essential to pick a clear stance if the instruction does not specifically ask to discuss both viewpoints. This essay would benefit from committing to one perspective thoroughly throughout the piece rather than balancing between two. This approach will ensure that the essay directly responds to the prompt as required.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** Overall, the essay is readable, but there are notable issues that need attention. For example, ""tradition press"" should be ""traditional press,"" and ""compares to"" should be ""compared to."" Additionally, maintaining consistency in tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement will improve the essay's clarity and professionalism. Phrases are generally clear, but refining sentence structure can enhance the readability and flow of ideas.

3. **Author's Point of View:** The initial stance appears to be that the Internet will become as important as traditional press, but the essay wavers between supporting both the Internet and newspapers equally. To improve, the essay should consistently support the chosen standpoint throughout, providing a more persuasive argument.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay includes reasons to support both the importance of newspapers and the growing significance of the Internet. However, since the task requires a singular viewpoint, it would be beneficial to focus on developing more detailed and descriptive arguments for one side only. Including specific examples, like the reference to Medium, is good, but ensure these examples directly support the chosen standpoint consistently throughout the essay.

In summary, focusing on a singular viewpoint and providing detailed support for that perspective would significantly strengthen the essay. Paying attention to grammar, spelling, and ensuring that the writing directly responds to the essay prompt are crucial steps for improvement. By making these adjustments, the essay will not only align more closely with proficiency test expectations but also provide a clearer and more compelling argument on the chosen topic.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

In this essay, I will enlist possible factors triggering this problem and recommend some measures to alleviate it. \n There are many causes contributing to the alarming percentage of young criminals. First of all, it can be attributed to the lack of attention and appropriate education from parents. Some of them are in the habit of overindulging their children or giving little care to their social awareness, creating an opportunity for bad behaviours to form. Moreover, the boom of Internet and social networking sites can be seen as a culprit. This leads to the unbridled spread of deleterious thoughts and beliefs implanted in young people and incite them to committing crime. \n Effective solutions should be taken to mitigate this issue. First, a joint effort from parents and schools should be made to keep detrimental behaviours away from children. Enlightening campaigns to raise their awareness of crimes should be conducted at school while parents can keep a stricter way of education and make immediate interventions when potential signs of crimes are detected. Furthermore, it is crucial that authorities should control the flow of information on the Internet. For example, they can hire Internet experts to keep track of posts, videos and pages spreading moral deterioration and delete them as soon as possible. \n In conclusion, there are a variety of factors resulting in a climb in the number of young criminals. It is of paramount importance that steps should be taken from many sides to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control.","The restatement is not related to the original presentation. The real topic makes a statement about worldwide crime rates. It never infers that the subject is a pressing concern. The prompt restatement is a failure.

The restatement + personal opinion paragraph does not deliver the correct response format. The topic is incorrect as well. This paragraph is non-passing which means, the essay will start from a failing base score. This essay is not going to recieve a passing end score. \n The paragraphs lose cohesiveness and coherence due to the improper discussion development.

However, there are key areas that need improvement to make the argument stronger and more aligned with the expectations of an English proficiency test essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The essay begins by identifying the increase in crimes among young people as a ""pressing concern."" However, it misses directly addressing the global aspect of crime rates, which was expected from the original topic. It's important to accurately restate and understand the given essay prompt to ensure that the essay directly responds to what has been asked. A closer alignment with the global context of the topic would enhance its relevance.

2. **Structure and Coherence:**
   Following a clear and organized structure can significantly improve the coherence of the essay. Each paragraph should ideally start with stating a cause, followed by its reason, a related solution, an explanation of how this solution could be implemented, and a supporting example. By restructuring your paragraphs to include these elements, your argument would become more persuasive and easier to follow. This approach ensures each paragraph comprehensively covers a single cause and its corresponding solution, facilitating a better flow of information.

3. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues:**
   Overall, the essay is largely free from major grammatical errors, but attention can be paid to enhancing stylistic choices. For instance, varying sentence structure and using a mix of simple and complex sentences could make the text more engaging. Ensure every sentence serves a purpose, either by providing new information or supporting an existing point.

4. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:**
   The essay's perspective is evident—it aims to highlight contributing factors to youth crime and proposes solutions. To further strengthen this standpoint, explicitly state how each suggested solution could effectively combat the identified causes. This direct linkage will solidify your position.

5. **Arguments and Support:**
   The arguments regarding the causes of youth crimes, such as the influence of the internet and parental neglect, are notable. However, providing specific examples or citing relevant studies could significantly bolster these claims. Moreover, when discussing solutions, detailing the implementation process and potential impact would make the argument more convincing.

In summary, aligning the essay more closely with the given prompt, structuring paragraphs to combine causes with detailed solutions, and bolstering arguments with specific examples or evidence will significantly enhance its effectiveness. It's also beneficial to refine the introduction and conclusion to accurately mirror the essay's argument and response to the topic. By addressing these areas, the essay will likely present a stronger, more cohesive argument.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Although each situation has its own risk, the benefits of this condition exceeds the drawback, which will be discussed in this essay. \n One of the weaknesses from doing the job training is there are less career options. Job training and a real job in the future are intertwined, because mostly people who do the vocational training are recruited by companies with the same field before graduating. Therefore, they may not have many options related to their job. That means when people decide to undergo a work training, they should also carefully consider their working field. \n However, this condition gives better offer than just a career field. When people are called for a job before their graduation, they can immediately work without worrying about not having a job. Additionally, it is often for some companies to pay a salary for people who do an apprenticeship. It means that people can pay for their job training tuition fees as if it is reducted. Hence, they can get faster money compared to people who studying at university. \n To sum up, doing training for a job gives more merit for people rather than going to tertiary education. Despite having less career field option, their future job is guaranteed and they do not have to worry about being unemployed.

1. Introduction: It's good that you mentioned what the essay will discuss, but instead of just saying ""which will be discussed in this essay,"" try to briefly outline your main arguments or reasons. This could give the reader a clearer idea of what to expect and ensures your essay's point of view is clearly stated from the beginning.

2. Clarity of Opinion: While you do state that the benefits of on-the-job training exceed the drawbacks, giving a short preview of the reasons behind your opinion right at the beginning could strengthen your argument. This approach helps in making your standpoint clear throughout the essay.

3. Spelling and Grammar: There are a few spelling and grammar issues that need attention. For example, ""the benefits of this condition exceeds the drawback"" should be ""the benefits...exceed the drawbacks."" Additionally, words like ""apprenticeship"" and phrases like ""it is often for some companies to pay"" could be made clearer or corrected for smoother reading.

4. Structured Argument: Your arguments are generally clear and support your position well. However, consider expanding on how the limitation of career options in on-the-job training is a significant drawback and compare it more directly with the broader educational scope offered by formal education. More descriptive examples or comparisons could enhance your argument.

5. Conclusion: The essay requires a concluding paragraph that summarizes the main points discussed. It's crucial not only to present new information in the conclusion but to reflect on what has already been said. This ensures the reader is left with a clear understanding of your stance on the topic.

6. Stylistic Issues: Try to vary your sentence structure to make your essay more engaging. Using a mix of complex and simple sentences can help maintain the reader's interest.

However, to effectively respond to the essay prompt, it's crucial to directly answer if the government should regulate the fast food industry with a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" stance, supported by strong and directly relevant arguments. Here's how your essay could be improved:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The prompt asks for a decisive stance (yes or no) on whether the government should regulate the fast food industry like the tobacco and alcohol industries, supported by at least two solid reasons. Your essay discusses both advantages and disadvantages without clearly choosing a side or providing specific reasons directly tied to government regulation. Consider revising your introduction to explicitly state your position and ensure that your supporting paragraphs focus on reasons directly related to the possibility of government intervention.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are spelling and grammar mistakes that can be addressed for a smoother reading experience. For example, ""oppinions"" should be ""opinions,"" ""agruments"" should be ""arguments,"" and ""shoud"" should be ""should."" Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure to enhance the flow and clarity of your writing. 

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view is implied but not strongly stated. A clear thesis statement at the end of your introduction that directly addresses the prompt will help clarify your stance. For instance, ""The government should regulate the fast food industry because it will reduce public health issues and increase state revenue.""

4. **Arguments to Support Your Position:** While you mention potential benefits and drawbacks of regulating the fast food industry, your arguments need to be more focused on how government regulation (similar to that of tobacco and alcohol) could specifically address the issue. Each argument should be directly linked to your thesis and elaborated upon with examples or evidence. For instance, if arguing for regulation, explain how it could decrease consumption and improve public health with specific examples or data.

Remember, the purpose of this essay is to articulate a clear, supported position on government regulation of the fast food industry. Focusing on directly answering the question with well-explained reasons will strengthen your argument and help meet the expectations of the prompt.

4907,https://essayforum.com/writing/rising-rate-juvenile-crimes-become-alarming-92918/,dev,The rising rate of juvenile crimes has become an alarming practice for the public; TASK 2 IELTS,"Young people who commit crimes should be treated the same way as adults \n . \n To what extent do you agree or disagree? \n These days, the rising rate of juvenile crimes has become an alarming practical for the public. It is argued that the young who break the laws should be punished equitably as adults. From my perspective, I partly agree with this view and this essay will hold the reasons for my view. \n On the one hand, juvenile delinquents should receive the same punishments as mature lawbreakers. If youth crimes receive reduced sentence, they may not be aware of the seriousness of their action. In particular, youngsters think that the law cannot severely punish them because they are under 18 years old. Therefore, they can rely on this leniency to re-offend which lead to more severe consequences. Furthermore, if a teenager is tried in court as an adult, others will consider the results which they have to face when they take part in unlawful acts. Thus, this contributes to decline in juvenile offender rate. \n On the other hand, I am inclined to think that the young and adults should be convicted in different forms. First, in this period, adolescents' mental capacity is not full developed in structure and functions. They could be impacted by many negative external factors such as Internet, environment and even family resulting in an increase in criminal trends. In addition, they are more likely to suffer from permanent emotional damage if punished in ways that adults are. Thence, this greatly affects their ability to renovate and restore successfully. Instead of being severe sentences, the youth should be placed in appropriate rehabilitation and re-education programs. \n To conclude, the youth have to take the punishments for what they did. However, I think the youth should be judged differently from adults.","The prompt restatement has become partially inaccurate due to the inclusion of information that is not mentioned in the original presentation. Rather than presenting an accurate restatement of only 2- 3 sentences, the writer created a partially deviant rephrasing with a missing reasoning statement. The writer failed to establish his discussion grounds to provide the clear extent of his partial opinion in a summarized form as needed for this discussion.This opening paragraph will not receive full marks credit due to these reasons. \n Both explanations lack full development. There are no examples provided in each instance to convince the reader to consider the points presented. Each reason could use better cohesive devices to better connect the sentence thoughts and paragraph relationships. \n Vocabulary misuse is also evident in the writing. A person cannot be renovated and restored. He can be rehabilitated though. Expect IR deductions due to the lack of proper vocabulary usage leading to GRA deductions caused by a lack of proper sentence structuring. Both of which will also reduce the C + C score as the reference lacks clarity and confuses the reader in relation to thought meaning. \n The concluding summary does not fulfill the scoring requirements of the reverse paraphrase either. It does not recap the reasons for the writer's given opinion. An important scoring element in this case it does not contain the menemum 40 word requirement either. \n Overall, the writer shows evidence of writing ability and comprehension skills but requires development and correction in the aforementioned areas. This essay is a slight improvement over the first attempt that I reviewed.","Based on the given essay, here are several key points of feedback to consider that blend the human feedback insights with a focus on improvement and clarity:

1. **Topic Response Accuracy**: The introduction needs refining. Begin by accurately restating the essay prompt in a clear and concise manner. Ensure that the restatement includes 2-3 sentences that accurately reflect the original topic without adding unrelated information. Establish your stance (agree/disagree) clearly, making it evident from the start how you partially agree or disagree with the given statement about treating young offenders as adults.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Watch for vocabulary usage and make sure the words chosen convey the intended meaning effectively. For instance, individuals cannot be ""renovated"" like buildings; instead, they can be ""rehabilitated"" or helped to lead better lives. Pay attention to sentence structure to avoid grammar deductions. Aim for clear and coherent sentences that accurately express your thoughts.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is mentioned as partly agreeing with the statement given in the essay prompt. However, ensure this view is consistently clear throughout the essay by summarizing your opinion briefly in the introduction and exploring it fully in the body paragraphs.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence**: Both sides of the argument you present lack full development. Enhance your essay by providing specific examples that support your viewpoints; these examples will add weight to your arguments and make them more convincing. Furthermore, improve the cohesion within and between paragraphs by using transitional phrases to better connect ideas and sections of your essay.

5. **Conclusion Improvements**: The concluding paragraph needs to effectively summarize your reasons for the given opinion while also meeting the essay's requirements, including the minimum word count. Make sure to encapsulate your main points and stance in the conclusion clearly, providing a final thought on the topic that neatly ties back to your introduction.

6. **Overall Suggestions**: Strive for coherence and clarity in expressing your ideas. Incorporate feedback on vocabulary and sentence structure to elevate your writing quality. Each paragraph should have a clear main idea that ties back to your overall point of view.

Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice and reflection. Focusing on these areas will not only address specific issues noted in your essay but also help enhance your overall writing quality.

4908,https://essayforum.com/writing/reasons-water-pollution-influence-animals-90878/,dev,The reasons for water pollution and its influence on animals and humans,"In our contemporary world, water natural sources including rivers, lakes, and seas are seriously polluted. Water pollution is ascribed as a thorny issue of environmental conservation. This essay considers the reasons for water pollution before discussing its influences on animals and humans. \n On the one hand, several reasons drive this phenomenon. The primary reason definitely relates to the swift pace of development in general and industrialization in particular. For instance, industrial activities directly discharge hazardous waste into rivers and seas; these substances badly contaminate sources of water. Moreover, overpopulation is another prominent reason resulting in water contamination. In some religions, domestic wastes end their cycles in lakes, rivers, and seas. This is a case in light of the fact that there are tons of trash on land, which could not be decomposed in a short term. These factors have created numerous problems for environmental conservationists. \n On the other hand, this environmental dilemma severely affects animal life and human society. First and foremost, toxic substances from wastes are harmful to animals, especially marine creatures and birds which are fed with fish. In fact, humans have recently observed various accidents caused by trash and wastes. Plenty of marine species' death is recorded because they consume plastic and bottles. Water pollution has posed a considerable threat to the marine ecosystem. In addition to animals, water contamination has a significant repercussion on the human community. In such cases, freshwater would be inadequate to meet the daily requirement in the future. Once the marine life is damaged, a sufficient food supply is a thorny issue to deal with. \n In conclusion, I emphasize that industrialization and overpopulation are the fundamental factors leading to water pollution. Moreover, if humans are unable to address this problem, it will have a negative impact on marine life and mankind's society.","An immediate prompt alteration can be found in this essay that will have a detrimental effect on its task accuracy score. The original prompt asks for the ""effect"" of water pollution. The writer changed ""effect"" to ""influence"" in her restatement. The word meaning has to be considered in this case as the two words have different meangs when applied to the original topic. \n Effect refers to the outcome of a cause (water pollution). Influence refers to the power to affect, control or manipulate something or someone. Since pollution does not have the power to manipulate anything, saying that a discussion will be presented based on its influence is incorrect. Pollution only creates an ""effect"". Therefore, the writer will not get a passing TA score as the response provided is alternate to the required presentation. It indicates a lack of proper vocabulary knowledge and English understanding skills on the part or the writer. Based on this statement, the reason why the full response presentation does not meet the prescribed discussion requirements. This could definitely pull down the overall score to below passing.","The essay provides a well-structured discussion on the topic of water pollution, focusing on its causes and effects on animals and humans. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to enhance clarity, accuracy, and engagement with the topic.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to address the topic of water pollution's effects. However, it inadvertently shifts the focus to ""influences"" rather than directly discussing the ""effects"" of water pollution. To improve, it's important to directly connect the discussion to the outcomes or consequences (effects) of water pollution, following the original prompt's language closely. This adjustment will help in maintaining task accuracy and fulfilling the essay's requirements.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written but contains several small errors and awkward phrasings that could be refined. For example, in some instances, the plural form ""religions"" seems to be incorrectly used instead of ""regions."" Careful proofreading would help eliminate these errors and enhance the essay's readability. Additionally, varying sentence structures can make the argument more engaging for the reader.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay does a commendable job of presenting the author's stance on the causes and severe impacts of water pollution. However, clarifying and directly linking each point back to the question of how water pollution affects animals and humans will strengthen the author's argument. 

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay provides clear examples to support its points, such as the impact of pollution on marine life and the risk to human communities due to contaminated water sources. To further improve, consider adding more specific data or studies to back up these claims, making the arguments more persuasive. Additionally, exploring a wider range of effects, including health implications for humans, could provide a more comprehensive view of water pollution's impact.

By directly addressing the prompt, avoiding shifts in focus, correcting minor errors, and enhancing the support for your arguments, the essay can be significantly improved. Remember, clear and direct language that closely follows the prompt can help maintain focus and make the argument more compelling.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative
4909,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-claim-upcoming-years-printed-92969/,dev,"People claim that in the upcoming years, printed publications will be replaced by online materials","Many people claim that in the upcoming years, printed publications such as printed newspapers or physical books will be replaced by online reading materials which are available for everyone for free purchase. From my personal view, I firmly disagree with this conviction due to the significance of printed publications in our life, and not all online materials are free. \n First and foremost, personal reading preference opens up a world of possibilities, regardless of whether the reading materials are available online or offline. The disturbance of constant pop-up advertisements or message notifications is an annoying barricade of deep concentration when we read free articles on a modern device. Additionally, printed materials can be sought by collectors enthusiasts of paperback written their favorite authors to build their collections. Moreover, many people purchase printed publications because they enjoy reading and collecting physical books. \n Secondly, While it is the truth that online data can be accessed from anywhere in the globe and provide individuals with access to vast amounts of information that we search for every day, claiming that people can read everything online without purchasing is erroneous. I acknowledge that many websites operate with free access enabling visitors to read entire content and be profitable through advertisement contracts. However, famous online publications like The New York Times always have some policies regarding reading fees; particularly, providing subscription plans that give subscribers full access to premium features while non-subscribers can only read a restricted amount of articles. Similarly, most ebooks and other types of internet content are only available to purchase if they are lawfully distributed. \n In conclusion, although traditional forms of providing data are becoming obsolete due to their limited accessibility, it is flawed to claim that people can read everything free on the internet and reduce the purchase flow of printed publications. I admit that the exponential growth of technology brings a new era of reading preference with the appearance of ebooks and online newspapers but traditional reading materials are always important in our life.","Do not make claims that are not present in the original version so as not to negatively affect prompt restatement accuracy. There was never a reference to "" many people"". There is no point of view representation orginally so there should not heone in the retelling.

Do not confuse the please with the commonly used reference to ""free with every purchase"" indicating anon-sall related item or gift with purchase. That said, the paragraph contains a highly compliant opinion and reasoning foundation.

It may result in q passing but not high score in an actual setting.","Your essay provides a thoughtful perspective on the future of printed publications versus online material, engaging with the topic in a way that presents a clear viewpoint. However, there are areas for improvement that can enhance the effectiveness of your argument and the overall quality of your writing.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity of Argument:** Your essay successfully addresses the topic, arguing that printed publications will continue to be significant despite the rise of digital alternatives. Your clear stance against the belief that online materials will entirely replace printed ones is well-established and presents a solid foundation for your essay. It's important to avoid phrases like ""free purchase"" which may confuse readers, since purchasing implies an exchange of money. Instead, it would be more accurate to say that online materials are ""available for free"" or ""accessible at no cost.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Pay attention to your choice of linking words and ensure your ideas transition smoothly from one paragraph to the next. For example, using a phrase such as ""On a related note"" instead of ""Additionally"" could more effectively connect different aspects of your argument when shifting focus. This not only aids in maintaining the flow of your essay but also in keeping your reader engaged.

3. **Point of View and Argument Support:** Your essay successfully communicates your point of view, leveraging personal insights and examples to argue against the complete replacement of printed materials by online versions. While you've done well to express your opinions and support them with explanations, remember to be specific in your references. For instance, when mentioning ""traditional forms of providing data,"" clarify that you are specifically discussing printed newspapers and books. This precision helps your reader fully understand the scope of your argument.

4. **Developing and Structuring Arguments:** You've included strong arguments to support your viewpoint, particularly highlighting the drawbacks of online reading and the enduring value of printed materials. However, remember to equally develop all parts of your essay. The analysis of online publications' access restrictions is very compelling, demonstrating a good grasp of the topic. To further strengthen your essay, ensure that each paragraph contributes to your argument without repetition, and where possible, use data or well-known facts to back up your claims.

4910,https://essayforum.com/writing/necessary-people-questioning-authority-79945/,dev,(GRE) Is it necessary for people questioning the authority?,"Is it necessary for people questioning the authority? It depends on the characteristic of the authority. The more the authority represent will of people, the less questions people need to raise about the authority's activities. \n First of all, well-being of society is improved by questioning authority that doesn't have legitimacy. Because illegal authority normally doesn't try to improve lives of people. Their major concern is maintaining their power. In this situation, people cannot expect the authority would take responsibility of improving people's well-being. For example, Korean people protested authoritarian regime for their legitimate rights and well-being in the 1970s. They demand political rights such as making political parties and so on. Through struggles, they could gather people's attention on the problem and finally attained political democracy. Under the democratic political order, people's well-being was significantly improved comparing with that under authoritarian regime. Without their questioning the authority, their well-being could not be enhanced. \n Secondly, the authority could betray well-being of people even if it has legitimacy in some extent. Because the authority could be vulnerable to strong interest groups such as big business owners. Economical moguls can give enormous political funding to political power. Then the political power would be likely to represent not people's general will but will of several powerful persons. In this situation, people need to question the authority and enforce political power to represent their interests. Of course, the easier way of making politicians represent the general people's will is voting for alternative politicians. However, this strategy is not always effective. If we consider politicians and political parities under a democratic political system such as U.S., U.K., etc. we can know how the strategy is not enough for political power to represent general will of people. Questioning the authority and protesting for their well-being, they could gather people's attention and form public opinion that is favorable for alternative political power that represents people's well-being. For example, U.S. citizens succeeded in making major political power legislate regulation of excessive financial institutions after protests in the late 2000s. \n In the last place, people need to trust the authority and political process when political parties try to improve people's well-being. In this situation, raising excessive question to the authority could delay a proper compromise and consequence for enhancing people's well-being. \n In conclusion, questioning the authority is available to improve their well-being, which contributes to make political power represent people's general will insofar as it's not too excessive to delay the appropriate political process.","Dear student, the score for this GRE essay will not be higher than a 2 because you totally disregarded the discussion instructions.

Since you neither agreed nor disagreed with the discussion points provided, and your reasoning was not aligned with the original prompt information, your whole response to the essay became irrelevant and seriously flawed.","The essay reviewed provides an interesting discussion on the necessity of questioning authority and its impact on society's well-being. However, there are several areas where improvement is essential for aligning the essay more closely with the expectations of a proficient analytical essay, especially for English proficiency tests like the GRE.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to tackle an engaging topic about the necessity and consequences of questioning authority. However, the essay doesn't explicitly agree or disagree with a clear statement or question as typically required. For future essays, start with a clear thesis statement that directly responds to the essay prompt, indicating whether you agree or disagree, and outline the reasons that will be explored. This will ensure your essay is directly relevant to the task given.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are minor issues with grammar and style that can be improved. For instance, maintaining a consistent tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement could enhance readability. Additionally, sentences could be structured more clearly to avoid confusion. When editing, consider reading sentences aloud or having a tool check for grammatical errors to catch mistakes.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Your position becomes clearer as the essay progresses, yet it lacks a direct and explicit statement of your stance at the beginning. A defined thesis statement in the introduction would immediately clarify your perspective, making the rest of the essay stronger and more focused.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides examples to support the discussion, which is a positive aspect. However, the arguments would benefit from deeper analysis and more direct alignment with a central thesis. Instead of presenting examples broadly, dissect these instances more thoroughly to show precisely how they support your stance. Including counterarguments would also strengthen the essay by showcasing an understanding of opposing viewpoints and refuting them with logic and evidence.

To further enhance your essay, consider the structure and flow. Ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next, with each supporting point clearly tied back to your main argument. Additionally, a more formal tone and avoidance of first-person narration may align better with academic essay standards, particularly for proficiency exams.

Remember, practice and receiving feedback are key to improvement. Keep writing, revising, and refining your approach to essay writing, focusing on the outlined areas for enhancement.",3,4,3,4,4,3,1,3,4,1,Argumentative

Pollution is directly proportional to the number of cars each individual is using today. In this I will provide some solutions along with the examples. \n The main source of pollution is the harmful gases like Carbon monoxide etc. which emits from the vehicle. These gases then pollute the environment and cause death threatening diseases. This is problem because today the number of car is rapidly increased in many cities. As every individual commute to the office by their own car. For Instance, Delhi newspaper reported that in recent three years 40 percent more cars are running on the roads and subsequently pollution is also gained momentum in parallel. This problem can be solved if people start sharing their car and then individuals who are working in same company go by the car pooling option. As a result of this, there will be less number of cars running on the road and which consequently reduce the pollution. \n Number of cars on road also increases the chances of traffic along with pollution. Therefore to solve this issue, it is importance that individual should also use the public transport alternatively which is very convenient and cheap today. In this they will do the personal savings and also help the environment. For Example, The government of Delhi started the odd/even rule in the city i.e. alternatively odd and even number cars will run on the road. This had an immense impact on the pollution level in positive manner. Thus, government of respective cities should also provide the solutions which will help in minimizing the pollution in environment. \n In conclusion, pollution is not a problem which is insurmountable it can be controlled if every individual contribute towards the society by choosing the car pool option and also use public transport frequently.

The prompt paraphrasing and discussion presentation in the first paragraph is very acceptable and allowed the reader to gain a sense of what to expect as per your upcoming discussions. You seem to have a problem with the use of capital letters though. You often use it in the wrong areas of the sentences. Just remember that only the first letter of a word at the start of a new sentence needs to be capitalized. Everything else after that, unless considered a proper noun, need not capitalize the first letter of the word. Your discussion is sound and does not cause the reader too much stress.

These suggestions are supported by relevant examples, including the implementation of the odd/even rule in Delhi, demonstrating a well-considered approach to mitigating pollution.

Nevertheless, the essay could benefit from improvements in several areas to enhance clarity and coherence. Firstly, attention should be given to grammatical structure and the use of lexical resources to ensure sentences flow smoothly and ideas are precisely conveyed. Issues such as sentence fragments or awkward phrasing could detract from the overall readability and impact of the argument.

Furthermore, there is a noticeable inconsistency in the use of capital letters throughout the essay. Standard English capitalization rules dictate that the first letter of the first word in a sentence, proper nouns, and specific titles should be capitalized; other instances should remain in lowercase. Adhering to these rules will not only improve the professionalism of the text but also aid in its readability.

The simplicity of the English used is advantageous for clear communication; however, a broader vocabulary could enrich the essay, adding depth and nuance to the arguments presented. Also, expanding the range of sentence structures used could enhance the expressiveness and dynamism of the writing.

The conclusion successfully encapsulates the essay's main points, reinforcing the argument that pollution control is an achievable goal through collective action and regulatory measures. This balance of personal responsibility and governmental intervention forms a coherent stance on the issue at hand.

In summary, this essay is a commendable effort, effectively engaging with the topic of pollution and global warming. By refining grammatical accuracy, paying close attention to capitalization, and broadening lexical resources, there is potential to elevate the essay's impact and readability significantly.

Considering the positive and negative sides, I can state that this issue may include both sides, but the negative side is more significant. \n On the one hand, cities have better living conditions compared to rural that they can provide them with a better quality of life. Equipped with outstanding infrastructure and facilities - cities can provide rural residents with better living conditions. For instance, traffic jams can be efficiently handled in big cities since police departments are prevalent; moreover, people coming from rural areas can have the opportunity to participate in higher education as well as experience diverse forms of entertainment and modern medical treatments. More importantly, it enhances the cities' workforces because the migration from rural to urban areas can bring potential labor that varies in many occupations. City migrants, by consequence, companies can approach and offer to work for their companies, for they believe the benefits it may bring. Thus, rural people moving to the cities can aid the city's development, and they can have a higher standard of living. \n On the other hand, the repercussions of the tendency of exodus from rural areas can lead to a strain on urban resources and affect city dwellers. The more people flock to cities, the higher the price of housing, medical, and education since the demands are surging; the higher the rate of traffic congestion since the traffic participants are rising. The outcome of this is the adequacy of infrastructure, overwhelmed services, and a decline in living quality. Also, the development in rural areas is heavily depended on the youths. If younger generations in the rural areas decide to live in the urban, the less likely the areas can obtain success in becoming better due to the loss of educated and strong workforces. The existence of the whole area will rely on the much older generations who had less experience with technology and were physically ill. That is the undoubted consequences the countries may face unless the prevalence of migration stops. \n In conclusion, although the demand for a better life quality is understandable, the problems can cause harm and deter the countries from developing. According to numerous implications, rural residents should endeavor to improve their living conditions in rural areas rather than move to urban areas. \n I am currently struggling with the vocabularies and expressions. \n I need some advices to improve my writing styles as Im aiming for 7+ in IELTS writing task 2 \n tks!","This is not a passing score essay for several reasons.

Your current position seems ambiguous, making it difficult for readers to grasp your definitive viewpoint on whether rural-to-urban migration is positive or negative. Clarifying your stance will strengthen your essay and make your argument more compelling.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While your essay demonstrates a good command of the English language, there are opportunities to improve your word choice and sentence structures to make your arguments clearer and more persuasive. Avoid overly complex sentences that could confuse the reader, and instead aim for clarity and precision in your language. Additionally, watch out for minor grammatical mistakes and ensure subject-verb agreement and proper tense usage throughout your essay.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: You've done well to provide examples and reasons for both the positive and negative outcomes of urban migration.

4914,https://essayforum.com/writing/idea-single-sex-schools-boys-girls-94709/,dev,The idea of single-sex schools for boys and girls,"It would be argued by some people that boys and girls should be educated in single-sex schools. However, others suppose that they had better study in co-ed schools instead. \n On the one hand, there are a number of reasons why some believe that children should attend separated schools. The first reason is to limit the feelings between them. Because of being young and lacking significant knowledge, they easily fall in love and begin to be bored with studying, which can worsen their academic results. Therefore, by attending single-sex schools, there is little chance for their early relationships. Another reason is that separated schools help them to develop totally in each gender. Schools can organize suitable occasions and celebrations for boys or girls which not only help them to develop themselves but also make friends with others. \n On the other hand, in my point of view, I would agree that boys and girls benefit more from studying in mixed schools. Firstly, children are more able to make friends of every gender and likely become to be friendly and energetic. They can find a suitable person to play with, for example, not every boys like to play sports but dolls. Moreover, they can access many activities which provide them with knowledge about sexuality. They would care more about gender inequality and have a better understanding of themselves as well as others. Children also can find their real sexual orientation and live with their best version. \n In conclusion, although some people think that boys and girls should study in different schools, I personally believe that they had better be educated in co-ed schools.","This presentation is under developed. The writer does not clearly offer his opinion in the opening paragraph. That is a scoring requirement when it comes to preliminary task accuracy. So by skipping that presentation, the writer is going to receive a lower TA score. Always present the complete task requirements in the first paragraph. In this case, the personal opinion should have been presented. \n As for the reasoning paragraphs, there is an inequality in the presentation. The writer only discussed one public opinion before presenting his own. The format for this essay requires that both public opinions are presented in the discussion, with the writer either providing an individual opinion for each public perception or, he presents a stand alone paragraph as a third option, to complete the discussion presentation. There should not be any skipping of discussion focus points.","Your essay on whether boys and girls should be educated in single-sex or co-educational schools touches upon an important topic. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make your argument stronger and more aligned with the essay requirements.

1. **Response to the Topic:** You've chosen a relevant topic, but it's essential to clearly state your opinion right from the beginning. This helps the reader understand your stance and sets the stage for your arguments. To improve, consider adding your personal opinion in the first paragraph, making it clear whether you support single-sex or co-educational schools. This clarity is crucial for meeting the essay's requirements and ensuring your readers are immediately aware of your perspective.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Overall, your essay is readable, but there are minor grammatical and stylistic issues that could be polished. Pay attention to verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. For example, ""it would be argued"" might be more directly stated as ""some argue."" Also, consider varying your sentence structure to maintain reader interest and engagement. Simplifying complex sentences could help make your essay more accessible, especially for a diverse audience.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view becomes clear later in the essay, but as mentioned earlier, stating it upfront is critical. This ensures that your readers are not left guessing about your stance on the issue. 

4. **Arguments and Support:** You present arguments for both perspectives, which is good. However, the essay would benefit from a more balanced discussion. Present reasons why some believe in single-sex education and why others prefer co-educational settings in equal measure before weighing in with your viewpoint. This balanced approach will strengthen your essay by showing you have considered multiple angles of the topic. Additionally, providing concrete examples or citing studies could improve the persuasiveness of your arguments.

To further enhance your essay, consider adding a paragraph that offers a direct comparison between the benefits and disadvantages of each schooling method, based on the opinions you've already discussed. This comparison could serve as a strong foundation for summarizing your own viewpoint and making a compelling case for it.

Remember, the goal is to make your essay as clear, engaging, and convincing as possible. Following these suggestions should help you achieve a more structured and persuasive presentation of your arguments. Keep writing, and with practice, your skills will continue to improve.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4915,https://essayforum.com/writing/investments-wild-animals-protection-86735/,dev,IELTS WRITING TASK 2: ARE INVESTMENTS ON WILD ANIMALS PROTECTION WORTHY?,"Some people argue that time and money investments on wild animals are too large and these investments should be spent on humans. I completely disagree with this point of view. \n Firstly, in my opinion it is absurd to argue the investment on wild animal protection is redundant. It is true that in recent years, we have been organized numerous campaigns to raise people 'awareness about the importance of wild animal protection and erected parks and animal conservation sites to protect animals, which can cost a fortune. However, it appears that there are several other areas which are burning money of human such as nuclear energy and space exploration. Take space exploration as an example, the budget of a rocket production is far higher than that of a zoo. Similarly, the training fee for a zoo keeper is nowhere near as expensive as that of an astronaut. Hence, the financial investment on wild animal protection is nothing comparing with that of other fields. \n Secondly, wild animals play a crucial role in humans' lives. Protecting animals means protecting their habitats which are instrumental in balancing the ecosystem. If wild animals die out, the ecosystem is destroyed. As a result, humans are likely to face with extreme weather such as climate changes and other disasters. Besides, wild animals is a rich source of science research. Scientists usually do some observe and analyze the manners and behaviors of those species and their exploration after that can broaden the knowledge of human about nature even some of them are considered as foundation for human research. \n In conclusion, in my opinion the investment we spent on animals is money-worthy and wild animals protection is always a matter of importance.","While your essay is grammatically imperfect, it is nice to see that you understood exactly how to discuss the topic based on the given instruction. I am even more pleased that you focused your reasoning paragraphs in the proper manner. That is, you focused on strengthening your your opinion using strong reasons. However, you should have used more ""emotional"" or ""measured"" words to continue to the ""extent"" form of discussion in your reasoning paragraphs. \n Some of the ""emotional"" or ""extent"" words you could have used in your topic sentences are: \n I firmly believe that... \n I greatly disagree because... \n I staunchly believe that... \n I decidedly support the opinion that... \n The extent essay measures your ability to support your opinion based on a specific set of vocabulary words. All of these words convey a strong emotion, while also allowing you to highlight the range of your grammar skills.

It is encouraging to see your essay structured with clear reasoning paragraphs that effectively back up your stance. However, there are several areas where improvements can enhance your essay significantly.

Firstly, to bring more depth to your discussion, try incorporating more emotionally charged or emphatic words in your statements. Phrases such as ""I firmly believe that..."" or ""I greatly disagree because..."" not only show strong conviction but also help in emphasizing the extent of your stance on the topic. Employing such vocabulary not only enriches your language use but also showcases your ability to engage deeply with the essay's topic.

Regarding grammar and sentence formation, while your efforts are commendable, focusing on making your sentences smoother and more understandable would be beneficial. Engaging more with English, through exercises, reading materials, or even subtitled movies, can significantly improve your language skills. This practice will help you construct more complex and polished sentences, improving the overall readability of your essays.

Another critical aspect to refine is the formatting of your opening and concluding paragraphs. Ideally, both should contain at least three sentences that respectively introduce and summarize the main points of your essay. Including a restatement of the topic, your response to it, and a concise summary of your reasons in these sections can make your essay more coherent and impactful.

Lastly, your essay showcases potential with its clear topic sentences, explanations, and supporting examples. Still, enhancing the presentation of your ideas and sentence structures will make your arguments even more persuasive and easier to follow.

The statement denotes the cause to become a great nation, that depends on the comfort of general citizen. Indeed, the most plausible, significant basis of a great nation lies in the citizen's welfare. \n If common people get treated impartially, that is the indication of a great nation. In India, before the 21st century, there is a castism. The higher hierarchy people had been living in pleasure, while lower hierarchy people had been incurring. The nation had a wide gap between poor and rich, low class and high-class people. Higher class people were happy, in contrary lower class people suffered humiliation. In such circumstances, the nation cannot be called great. \n The citizen of the country plays a major role in development and advancement of the country. Each and everyone's contribution helps to regulate the country. For example, farmers provide food to us. The doctor treats people's illness. Teachers teaches people in order to aware them about the world. Everyone is special. The country becomes great with the support of these people. \n Many people in the country become worldwide personalities through their extraordinary achievements. Does that mean the country is great? In India, there are lots of actors with worldwide fame. Their achievements make them great. They are known as great people who belongs to India, not the people belong to the great nation. This makes a difference. The achievements of people are rather personal than national. \n Although scientist, artist, rulers help to enhance the development of the nation, the greatness of nation does not totally dependent on them.

You were able to show a clear understanding of the prompt topic and your discussion proves that you have the ability to make yourself understood by the reader on using average considerations. You could have scored higher with your essay presentation had you properly paraphrased the topic for discussion as an introduction to the topic rather than trying to define what the word ""great"" means. the definition of the word, in your understanding, is not as effective as when you might have tried to first, depict a restatement of the original argument presented. The rest of the essay, starting from the second paragraph, is pretty good. Your use of the caste system that exists in India helped you to better illustrate your given discussion opinion.

Do not forget to press the space bar between finished sentences so that the reader will not have a hard time differentiating where the old sentence ends and the new one begins.

If you apply the changes I am suggesting here in your next essay, that essay should garner you a better score.","This essay successfully captures the essence of what makes a nation great, focusing on the well-being and impartial treatment of its citizens as the cornerstone of greatness. However, there are areas that require attention and improvement for the essay to more effectively convey its message.

Firstly, the introduction would benefit from a clearer restatement of the essay's main argument, rather than trying to define the term ""great."" Beginning with a direct interpretation or rephrasing of the prompt could engage the reader better and set a more focused direction for the essay. 

Regarding content, the discussion on the caste system in India and its impact on society illustrates the argument well. This example provides a concrete basis for your claim but delve deeper into how overcoming such disparities contributes to national greatness could strengthen your essay.

The essay structure and presentation need refinement. Sentence spacing must be consistent to improve readability; each sentence should be clearly separated from the next. This will help the reader understand where one thought ends and another begins, making the essay more accessible.

To further enhance your writing, pay attention to spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues. For example, watch for the correct use of present and past tense, proper use of plurals, and ensuring subject-verb agreement. Terms like ""castism"" should be correctly spelled as ""casteism,"" and phrases like ""teachers teaches"" should be corrected to ""teachers teach"" for clarity and accuracy.

While you mention the roles of scientists, artists, and rulers, illustrating how they contribute to the welfare of all citizens could solidify your argument about what constitutes a great nation.

Some are in favor of getting married before finishing studies is foolish, considering that there is no stable income source and the young students are not mature enough. But I disagree with that, in my opinion, by getting married in college the two people can benefit a lot from a range of measures, for example take responsibility, get closer and so on. \n It is usually true that students do not have good income source and depend on parents financially, but this should not be an issue for getting married in college. The marriage is more about live together happily instead of money. Students have a lot of time to study together, build common interests and so on, all these will help them to strengthen the connection. \n Moreover, getting married means the two people will take responsibility for each other and behave differently from before. Such change will get the couple to think and plan their future life and career more carefully, they can get mature during the process. The earlier the couple learn taking responsibility the better will they behave in the community, this in turn will benefit the society.

The opening statement has a particular section that is confusing to read. It is the second sentence that seems to not have decided upon which aspect of the prompt you wish to side with in your essay. You say that "" <em>Some are in favor of getting married before finishing studies is foolish, ""</em> . If the person speaking is in favor of getting married before graduating, then it should not be foolish. He supports the act, therefore, it is not foolish. However, those who oppose the idea can believe that such an act is foolish. Do you see the difference?

Unfortunately, that really affected the overall precision by which you presented your ideas and had to be scored accordingly. You also used the word ""But"" to start a sentence which is academically unacceptable in formal writing.","The essay delves into a debatable topic: the merits of getting married before finishing studies. Here's a structured feedback focusing on the aspects requested:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
Your essay directly engages with the topic by presenting a view that is somewhat unconventional - advocating for early marriage among students. This is clear and aligns well with the prompt, addressing whether getting married before completing studies is beneficial.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:**
- **Clarity and Precision:** Be cautious with how you present opposing views to avoid confusion. For example, the statement about some people finding marrying before finishing studies ""foolish"" is contradictory to your stance and needs clearer phrasing to show the contrast between differing opinions more effectively.
- **Formal Writing Style:** Avoid using conjunctions such as ""But"" to start sentences. This practice is generally considered informal and not suited to academic writing.
- **Grammar and Syntax:** Pay attention to sentence structure for clarity and effectiveness. There are instances where sentences could be more concise or more grammatically sound, which would enhance the overall readability of your essay.

3. **Author's Point of View:**
Your point of view is evident throughout the essay - you support the idea of getting married before completing studies. This perspective is maintained consistently, which helps in forming a coherent argument. However, the initial confusion mentioned earlier could be misleading about your stance. Ensuring clarity from the start would solidify your position further.

4. **Arguments in Support of the Point of View:**
- **Supporting Arguments:** You provide several reasons to back your viewpoint, such as the opportunity for early responsibility-taking and the strengthening of connections between partners. However, these arguments would benefit from offering more detailed examples and possibly citing studies or statistics to increase their persuasive power.
- **Developing Arguments:** Consider exploring each benefit you mention in more depth. For instance, when discussing the potential for couples to grow closer, elaborate on how exactly studying together or sharing interests contributes to this. This will make your arguments more compelling and descriptive.

**Additional Points:**
- **Vocabulary and Language Use:** Expand your vocabulary range to express your ideas more precisely and vividly. A richer vocabulary will make your essay more engaging and demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency.
- **General Linguistic Range:** Strive for variety in your sentence structures and word choices to showcase your language skills. This also helps in making your essay more enjoyable to read.

In conclusion, while your essay introduces a strong and clear viewpoint on an intriguing topic, enhancing the clarity, precision, and depth of your arguments will significantly improve it. Paying attention to grammatical accuracy and formal writing conventions will also elevate the quality of your work. Keep practicing, and remember, each essay is a step towards mastering the art of persuasive academic writing!",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,2,Argumentative
