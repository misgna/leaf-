4019,https://essayforum.com/writing/change-good-people-life-76705/,test,IELTS Writing task 2 - Change is good for people's life or not?,"People have different views about the question of whether they should change or not. While many people persist in doing one thing in their whole life, personally I argue that change is an unavoidable thing in our life. \n On the one hand, many people tend to repeat the same things as they believe they have achieved some security. However, change is not always a personal option. Even when people believe they are resisting change themselves, they cannot stop the world around them from changing. For instance, technology and scientific breakthroughs are changing the world on a daily basis. Another example would be that some people do not want to change their jobs because they are familiar with their current work and their colleagues. If they work in another workplace, they need to adapt a new environment, and they cannot concentrate on their work. Sooner or later, however, they would find that the familiar jobs no longer exist, or that the safety behaviours are no longer appropriate. \n On the other hand, I believe that change brings positive consequences for people. To give one example, repeating one job may be too tedious, and change can help people to have motivation for working. However, change is not always for the better. A lot of innovations, for example, are made with the aim of making money. In that case new things should not be promoted. As a result, people need to keep pace with changes. \n On the whole, I believe that people should not remain to do the same things, although all change does not necessarily have good outcomes. \n ----","Dear student, your discussion would have been better if you had tried to follow the proper discussion outline as indicated in the original prompt. the problems with your essay started with the mistake that you made in the representation of the prompt in your paraphrasing. You neglected to properly assess the requirements of the essay and represent it in your outline plus paragraph discussion. How did you fail to properly assess the essay requirements? You were asked to discuss 2 points of view and then your personal opinion. You only discussed one point of view and your opinion. In terms of task accuracy, that would result in a score of 4 because your response to the required discussion is minimal. That will be a tremendous drawback in terms of your final score. \n It is important to get the highest possible marks in the TA section so that the other sections will automatically increase in possible scoring. If you can prove you understood the instructions, the examiner will be more lenient in terms of your other weaknesses. The failure of your opening statement, the paraphrasing sealed the failing score for your TA portion and assured that you would score failing to barely passing in the rest of the scoring considerations. The correct paraphrasing and discussion outline would be as follows: \n <em>There are two points of view regarding change in a person's life. One point of view is that people should always do the same things and never change. The other, is that change is a good thing for people's lives. This essay will examine the two points of view and offer my personal opinion and support for one of the two points of view.</em>","The essay presents a discussion on whether individuals should embrace change in their lives or not. The main argument is that change is inevitable and potentially beneficial, though not without drawbacks. To further enhance the essay and ensure it aligns more closely with expectations, consider the following feedback:

1. **Address the Essay Topic More Directly**: The prompt requires a discussion of two distinct viewpoints and your personal stance. The essay briefly touches upon the viewpoint that some people prefer consistency, but it focuses predominantly on the benefits of change and your personal perspective. To fully meet the essay requirements, explicitly discuss both viewpoints before presenting your opinion.

2. **Clarity and Structure**: The essay could benefit from a clearer structure that segregates the two viewpoints and your personal opinion more distinctly. A more effective approach could involve dedicating one paragraph to those who resist change, a second paragraph to the benefits of embracing change, and a final section to your personal viewpoint, ensuring all positions are explored thoroughly.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While there are minor issues with grammar and style, these do not significantly hinder understanding. To improve, pay attention to sentence structure and the use of articles (""a"", ""an"", ""the""). Also, consider varying sentence length and structure to make the writing more engaging.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The arguments supporting the value of change are compelling, especially when discussing the inevitability of change due to external factors like technology. However, the essay would benefit from more detailed exploration of why some people might resist change beyond the fear of the unfamiliar. Providing concrete examples and more in-depth analysis will strengthen the argument.

5. **Point of View**: Your personal stance on the issue is clear, which is a strength of the essay. Yet, ensure that when presenting your opinion, it is backed by well-explained reasoning and evidence. This will make your position more convincing.

6. **Task Response**: To directly address the essay task and improve scoring potential, ensure your opening statement or introduction accurately paraphrases the essay prompt and clearly outlines the structure of your discussion. This establishes a strong foundation and guides the reader through your arguments logically.

In summary, this essay demonstrates a thoughtful stance on the inevitability and benefits of change. With enhanced structure, a more balanced discussion of differing viewpoints, and a focus on clear, evidence-backed arguments, the essay could more effectively meet the requirements of the prompt and present a compelling argument.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic:** You've addressed the topic by mentioning the importance of both traditional and international music. That’s good! Yet, it would be beneficial to directly respond to the topic in an opening statement. This sets a clear direction for your essay.

2. **Essay Structure:** Your essay would benefit greatly from a more structured format, including an introductory paragraph, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should ideally have a specific focus. For example:
   - **Introductory Paragraph:** Briefly introduce the topic and your thesis (main idea or stance).
   - **Body Paragraphs:** Discuss your reasons and support them with examples or further explanation. Consider dedicating one paragraph to traditional music and another to international music.
   - **Conclusion:** Summarize your discussion and restate your main points or thesis in a fresh way.

Aim for 3 to 5 sentences per paragraph to allow for depth while maintaining clarity.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Keep an eye out for minor errors. For instance, ""genre these day"" should be ""genres these days,"" and ""is become"" should be ""has become."" Also, maintaining a consistent tense and paying attention to article use (e.g., ""an essential"" could be better expressed as ""essential for everyone"") will help improve readability. Varying your sentence structure will also enhance the flow of your writing.

4. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your opinion is noticeable, but it could be made clearer. State your thesis explicitly in the introduction and reiterate it in your conclusion to reinforce your stance.

5. **Arguments and Support:** While you mention that both types of music are important, delving deeper into why they are vital with specific examples or explanations would strengthen your argument. It's beneficial to explore how each type of music benefits individuals and society to back your viewpoint.

It seems more children are getting interested in watching TV shows that are not appropriate for their age. For example, since 2016 Trans TV Channel has launched reality show that related to adult love affair, and therefore ""Aku Mau Putus"" program is one of the TV programs that begin to attract the attention of children broadcasted every Friday at 15:00 to 16:00. This shows how adults kissing and hug which are inappropriate for young people to watch. \n On the other hand, allowing the children to watch an educational TV show is the wise choice for them. This is because more and more TV programs present shows that are related to school activities, and this helps children to recall the information they have learnt at school when watching the shows. For example, since 2018 Ministry of Indonesia Education has launched a policy to make sure that schoolchildren can review their school subjects through TV, and therefore ""Belajar Bersama"" broadcasted every day at 16:30 to 17:30 is one of the TV channels launched to present social and scientific knowledge designed to young learners aged 7 to 12. \n In conclusion, a parent should sort out a good TV show for children wisely.

Your response should show a degree of non/support for the given discussion, which is then supported by 2 reasons in your discussion paragraphs.

However, to elevate your writing and ensure it meets the requirements of an English proficiency test, consider the following feedback carefully. Your essay will greatly improve if you incorporate these suggestions:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay should directly address the question or topic provided. While you discuss both sides of children watching TV, the essay format appears mismatched to the expected response. For an essay of this nature, one should clearly state their position regarding the topic in the introduction, then support this stance with specific reasons in the body paragraphs. The conclusion should then restate your position and summarize the supporting reasons. It's crucial to understand different types of discussion essays; yours should explicitly present your opinion without setting up a comparison format unless specifically asked for.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:** To improve clarity, the transition between paragraphs and points needs to be smoother. Avoid using contrasting connectors like ""On the other hand"" if you haven't used a corresponding phrase (e.g., ""On the one hand"") to introduce your initial point. Such transitions suggest a comparative discussion, which doesn't align with the singular opinion structure of your essay. 

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Pay attention to spelling and grammar. There are minor errors and awkward phrasing in your essay which could be clarified. For example, ""Children would have a good educational show of it at different ways"" could be simplified to ""Children can benefit from educational shows in various ways"". This makes your argument clearer and your writing more professional. Additionally, ensure proper usage of tenses and agreement between subjects and verbs.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** Each argument you present should be clear and backed with specific examples or evidence. While you offer examples of TV programs, delve deeper into how these shows influence children’s behavior or learning, providing a more detailed analysis. This supports your viewpoint more persuasively.

5. **Point of View:** Your perspective should be unmistakable throughout the essay. While you discuss both the negative and positive aspects of children watching TV, your stance on whether the positives outweigh the negatives or vice versa isn't entirely clear. Strengthening your thesis statement to clearly articulate your viewpoint would help resolve this.

4022,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-believe-teenagers-focus-school-subjects-87074/,test,Ielts task2 - Some people believe that teenagers should focus on all school subjects,"In light of the improvement in the education system, people have different views about the school curriculum taken by adolescents. While there are good arguments in favour of paying attention to students' biased courses, I would argue that it is better to concentrate on every subject. \n On the one hand, youngsters focusing on their preferred subjects possibly attain higher grades. When youngsters are interested in or good at some specific subjects, they will get motivated and explore the detail of the courses by themselves. In this way, they will gain enthusiasm for studying and get well-prepared for the exam. For example, my friend Oscar who enjoys learning computer studies would search for the related sources for enriching his knowledge in IT. By getting a deeper understanding, he masters the IT subject and has obtained A+ in the exam. \n However, I believe that it is more beneficial for adolescents to put emphasis on all school subject courses. Firstly, subjects have a strong correlation thereof. For instance, studying physics requires a certain level of maths, while learning geography may be easier if students understand the basics of physics. Hence, teenagers can able to take advantage of their knowledge to apply to other subjects. Secondly, pupils perhaps figure their talents and passion unconsciously through learning all subject areas. Taking myself as an example, I used to hate maths. Yet, when I started learning 3D graphic, I gradually gain interested in maths, thereby, I am no longer reluctant to study maths and realize the capability in abstract thinking. \n For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that young people are more like to get benefits from concentrating on all subjects instead of emphasizing biased subjects.","You have a formatting error in this essay.

There are several strengths and areas for improvement within the essay that will be discussed.

Firstly, the essay is relatively aligned with the topic, engaging with the debate on specialized versus broad educational curricula. The argument is made in favor of a holistic approach to education, which is clearly stated and supported with examples. This clarity in expressing a viewpoint is commendable. However, the essay slightly deviates from the expected format for this assignment. The task requires a comparative analysis including a personal opinion, ideally structured over four or five paragraphs as follows:
1. Introduction with a paraphrase of the topic and a statement of the essay's structure.
2. Discussion of the first viewpoint, including public opinion and personal stance, supported by examples.
3. Discussion of the second viewpoint with reference to public opinion, personal insights, and illustrative examples.
4. Conclusion summarizing the arguments and reinforcing the writer's perspective.

Incorporating a more structured approach with clearer distinctions between public and personal opinions will enhance the readability and effectiveness of your argument.

Regarding language use, the essay is well-written, but there are minor issues to address:
- Pay attention to tense consistency to maintain flow and clarity.
- Using gender-neutral pronouns when discussing general opinions before clearly stating your personal stance can help differentiate between general perspectives and your viewpoint.
- Some sentences could be simplified for clarity and to make the essay more accessible to all readers, considering the target audience comprises English language learners.

In terms of content:
- Your examples are relevant and support your arguments well. Incorporating more varied examples from different subjects could strengthen your case for a broad curriculum.
- The connection between different subjects and the importance of interdisciplinary learning could be explored further to reinforce your argument.

In summary, your essay presents a thoughtful argument in favor of a diverse curriculum. To enhance your essay:
- Consider reformatting it to clearly separate general opinions from your personal viewpoint as per the recommended structures.
- Aim for clearer, simplified language while maintaining the sophistication of your argument.
- Incorporate varied examples and explore the relationships between subjects further.

Some take the view that the leaders of a country should hold accountable for the environmental protection as this practice is regarded as an onerous mission for individuals to take on. Analyzing the ability of individuals to recycle old things and reduce the amount of carbon emission by using public transport will illustrate the idea that individuals are capable of protecting the environment, not just the governments. \n Firstly, individuals could recycle the used materials to preserve the environment surrounding them. For example, Go Green, one of the leading environmental organizations established by environment-conscious Vietnamese members, has succeeded in invigorating millions of Vietnamese to recycle the receptacles after using them. As an individual organization could have the capability to raise people's awareness of the environment, the prospect of other individuals could have a similar impact on the whole society is probably no longer far-fetched. Thus, it is clear that not only the governments but also individuals could exert a huge positive impact on environmental improvement. \n Secondly, the upsurge in using public transport by individuals has the tremendous effect to put a damper on carbon emissions, which are the precursor to the degraded environment. A 2021 research carried out by the Vietnamese environment Institute shows the CO2 level in metropolises in the Northern part of Vietnam plunged as a result of changes in the commute habit of people. An inordinate number of people have utilized public transit as their main means of getting around instead of using personal vehicles such as motorbikes or cars. This example illustrates the idea that every individual can be a force of change to enhance environmental quality. Hence, it should be reassured that governments are not the sole force that has enough capacity to deal with complex environmental issues. \n In conclusion, I strongly agree that besides the governments, individuals have a crucial role in environmental preservation by taking simple actions such as reusing old materials and taking the advantage of public transit. Therefore, the public should join hands with the governments to uphold the quality of the environment we inhabit.","The essay will immediately receive a failing score in the preliminary TA assessment because it does not repost in the correct format. The expected response delivery was instead placed in the conclusion. That emotional response must be presented twice in the same essay. The first in the restatement, the second in the reverse paraphrase of the concluding summary. Although the writer wrote more than the necessary word count, his lack of attention to response detail is what proved to be detrimental to his final score. His first paragraph provided a prompt discussion deviation, which cannot be overlooked by the examiner. It does not create the proper foundation for the succeeding discussion paragraphs and therefore, made the overall essay non-passing in the final assessment.","Your essay tackles the significant topic of who should be responsible for protecting the environment, arguing that not only governments but also individuals play a crucial role. This is a valuable contribution to the discussion. However, to enhance your essay and make it more compelling, there are several areas where improvements can be made.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay slightly deviates from the expected format by placing a critical component of your argument—the emotional response and position statement—primarily in the conclusion rather than introducing it early in the essay and then reiterating it towards the end. To make your essay more impactful, introduce your stance in the opening paragraph clearly and then reinforce it in your conclusion. This approach ensures that your argument is evident from the beginning and is firmly anchored throughout your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay is generally well-written, but a more careful review of grammar and style can make it even stronger. Ensure that each sentence flows smoothly into the next and that your ideas are clearly and concisely expressed. Avoid overly complex sentences, as they can sometimes make your argument harder to follow.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** While your essay does present a clear point of view—that individuals, alongside governments, have a significant role in environmental protection—this perspective could be highlighted more strongly at the beginning. By stating your viewpoint clearly in the introductory paragraph, you set a solid foundation for the arguments that follow.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** Your essay contains compelling examples, such as the success of the Go Green organization and the impact of increased public transport use on carbon emissions. These examples effectively support your argument. However, to strengthen your essay further, consider adding more detail and evidence to these examples. Additionally, linking these examples more explicitly to how they support your thesis can make your arguments more persuasive.

In conclusion, your essay introduces essential discussions on environmental protection responsibility. By refining the organization of your essay to foreground your thesis, addressing minor stylistic and grammatical issues, and further developing your supporting arguments, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your essay. Remember, clear structure, compelling evidence, and a well-articulated stance will make your essay stronger and more persuasive.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

However, there are several areas that can be improved to enhance the clarity, structure, and alignment with the prompt.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The essay attempts to address the issue of free information sharing but does not fully align with the prompt's requirement to compare two points of view before presenting a personal opinion. Rather than presenting a comparative analysis of both perspectives, the essay predominantly reflects a personal stance against free information sharing. A more balanced approach, incorporating supporters’ viewpoints with equal emphasis and then contrasting these with personal views, would more effectively meet the prompt's requirements.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   There are a few spelling errors (""mayor"" should be ""major""; ""transparent"" might be better as ""transparency""; ""considerate"" should be ""consider""; ""Intellectual Poverty Rights"" likely means ""Intellectual Property Rights"") and grammatical issues present that impact the flow and clarity. Additionally, using more varied sentence structures and transitions could enhance readability and coherence. For example, connecting ideas within and between paragraphs more smoothly can make the argument more persuasive and easier to follow.

3. **Point of View Clarity:**
   The point of view is relatively clear; there is a strong personal stance against freely sharing information. However, integrating the counterargument more explicitly and providing a comparative viewpoint would not only clarify the personal standpoint but also demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic. This approach ensures that readers can easily grasp the multifaceted nature of the issue being discussed.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   The arguments provided, particularly concerning national security and intellectual property rights, are relevant but could be further developed. For instance, integrating specific examples, facts, or studies could strengthen the case against free information sharing. On the other hand, exploring the benefits of free information sharing, as seen by its proponents, with equal detail would create a more balanced and persuasive comparative analysis. Ensuring each viewpoint is substantiated with clear, descriptive arguments will better support the overall position taken at the end of the essay.

To improve, focus on presenting a balanced comparative analysis of both viewpoints on free information sharing. Work on spelling, grammar, and sentence variety to enhance readability.

The topic is approached with a balanced view, acknowledging the roles both entities play in addressing the problem. This perspective aligns well with the topic, showing an understanding of the complexity of climate change solutions.

One key area for improvement involves the structure and clarity of the essay's introduction. The thesis statement or primary opinion of the essay should be clearly presented within the introductory paragraph. This helps set the stage for the arguments to follow and provides a roadmap for the reader. Integrating the personal viewpoint more seamlessly with the overview of the essay's direction could enhance coherence and effectiveness.

The main body of the essay presents arguments regarding the responsibilities of both governments and individuals. These points are valuable but would benefit from more precise examples and deeper analysis. Expanding on how governments and individuals can contribute to solutions with specific examples and elaborating on the implications of these actions would make the arguments more compelling.

Regarding language use, there are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention:
- Watch for capitalization errors (“Not only do governments…” should not have ‘Not’ capitalized in this context).
- Pay attention to agreement and tense consistency (“the results of industry, which have produced carbon dioxide to cause greenhouse only can be solved and controlled by governments” could be smoother and more grammatically correct).

The conclusion reiterates the importance of a combined effort from both governments and individuals. While it captures the essence of the essay's argument, making it more specific about how both roles can be synergized could provide a stronger finish.

Lastly, ensure the essay is tailored to the expectations of the test it's intended for, such as TOEFL or IELTS, as each has its criteria and conventions regarding the presentation of opinions and essay structure.

In my opinion, I think it will become a positive development in the future. There are several reasons for this situation to explain under the following. \n The primary reason is the distance for each other. With our transportation system growth, people can go anywhere easily so we will know different nation people in the world. Most time it is difficult to meet each other face to face because we are far from each other. For example, once a time I traveled to German, I made a new friend, Ann, at that time. She is an English girl. During the travel, we chatted and become a good friend and at the end of the tour, we change our information and keep the friendship until now. Even we're not meet each other but we connect to each other on social media. \n Another reason is that some people need to leave their family for work or study, for these people when they miss their family or old friend they only can use the online way to talk and see them. Just like my best friend, Janny, she studied abroad, it is hard to see her in the real so we through skype to video chat. Even she was far from me but we feel close to each other. \n In conclusion, although it is still limited by distance, with the Internet we can connect the people we want in everywhere. Therefore, socialise online has became more popular for the whloe world and I think it will be a positive trend.","The essay is speaking of social media. Not the internet in general. Therefore your line of reasoning varies within the presentation, causing you to deviate in representation from the original prompt. There will be deductions every time you move away from the original prompt. Additionally, you should never use words of uncertainty in an essay that demands a solid be presented. That is because an uncertain reaction to the prompt means that you are unable to strongly defend your position and beliefs on the matter. \n Your second paragraph gives a reason, but there is no topic sentence at the start. You should have started it off with something like; ""We live in a constantly connected world. Distance is often the primary reason we tend to lose physical relationships with people we meet. "" Or, you should have just started with the second sentence which has a clear topic sentence representation in "" Most time it is difficult to meet each other face to face because we are far from each other.

Most of your points deductions will be in the C&C, LR, and GRA sections. These will be quite heavy deductions because of the degree of mistakes made in the final presentation.","Your essay on the role of internet and social media in shaping relationships presents interesting ideas and personal experiences. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to the essay prompt. Here is a detailed feedback focusing on the requested aspects:

1- **Response to the Topic:**
Your essay intends to discuss how relationships are built on the internet, but it seems to focus more on social media rather than the internet as a whole. It’s important to stick closely to the essay prompt. When discussing the internet's role in building relationships, consider all its facets, not just social media. This will ensure your essay fully addresses the topic.

2- **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
There are a few spelling and grammatical errors in your essay. For example, ""replace with in person"" might be better expressed as ""rather than in person."" Also, when you say ""during the travel, we chatted and become a good friend,"" it would be more grammatically correct to say, ""we chatted and became good friends."" Pay attention to verb tenses and pluralization to make your writing clearer. Additionally, simplifying your sentence structure can help avoid confusion and make your points more persuasive.

3- **Clarity of the Essay Author's Point of View:**
Your point of view is clear; you believe that forming relationships over the internet will have a positive impact in the future. To strengthen this argument, ensure every paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence that reflects this view. For instance, instead of starting a new idea abruptly, introduce it with a sentence that ties it back to your main argument about the positive aspects of internet relationships. This will make your essay more coherent.

4- **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:**
Your essay provides personal anecdotes to support your viewpoint, which is a good strategy. However, your arguments could be more convincing with clearer topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph, as mentioned earlier. Also, ensure your reasons directly support the idea that internet-based relationships are beneficial. For each point you make, ask yourself how it demonstrates the positive aspects of these relationships. Additionally, try not to introduce new ideas without explaining how they support your argument.

In conclusion, your essay shows promise and engagement with the topic. Focusing on clear, simple language will help convey your ideas more effectively. Ensure that you closely align your discussion with the prompt and structure your essay with clear topic sentences and well-supported arguments. Reading more English material and practicing sentence structure can greatly improve your writing skills.

4027,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-buy-range-household-goods-positive-93192/,test,People buy a range of household goods ( positive or negative development? ),"It is a norm for families these days to equip their houses with a variety of household electrical appliances. In my opinion, both merits and downsides can be seen in such a tendency, however, I would argue that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits significantly. \n The fact that people direct their concerns towards household products is emblematic of a rise in living standard. Those appliances are virtually indispensable to families as it not only saves a great amount of time regarding domestic work but also plays a wider role in the mental life as well. For example, the Vietnamese traditional Tet holiday has food as the fundamental part and during this Lunar New Year celebration, people, especially women used to be in the tremendous and time-consuming business of preparing dishes peculiar to the festival. With the help of kitchen appliances, however, this work no longer occupies so much time as it took. Seen from the psychological perspective, this increases the time for other activities, such as a leisurely meal, which make life seem much easier. Furthermore, digital household goods like a television also contribute significantly as entertainers after a heavy day at work. In effect, turning on the set has been an easy option on rainy days and a decent way to bring the family together with a good show. \n Despite the positives mentioned above, there are a couple of reasons that turn the activity of purchasing a wide range of household appliances into an overall negative one. Firstly, the usage of those devices certainly increases the electric demand around the world and in order to meet this surge in need, power plants will be erected more and more. This results in the exploitation of land resources as well as others like coal to operate and generate the gargantuan amount of electricity consumed in each household. Secondly, electrical machines and devices usually go unfashionable very soon as new versions come out. As a result, a throw-away society is formed with many adverse consequences to the environment, including the increasingly growing mountain of electronic waste. This type of waste is linked to serious health problems due to toxic chemicals released into the land and water or the air when exposed to heat. \n In conclusion, while I agree with the sort of entertainment and convenience electrical appliances bring about, I strongly believe that it is a detrimental trend considering the environmental impacts.","Always remember to use a timer when doing the practice test.

Therefore, the task discussion expectation was not met. \n There is no clear defensible opinion present in the essay. It has failed to properly discuss the topic based on the given instruction.","The essay provides a detailed exploration of the topic regarding the use and impact of household electrical appliances. It presents both the positive aspects and the negative implications of their prevalence in modern homes. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the argument.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to cover both sides of the argument regarding the use of household electrical appliances. However, the prompt requires focusing on defending a single clear stance rather than comparing both merits and downsides equally. It's essential to closely analyze the question or prompt provided and structure the essay accordingly to meet its specific requirements. To improve, concentrate on presenting and supporting one primary viewpoint throughout the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** The essay is generally well-written but could benefit from further refinement in sentence structure and grammar. Paying closer attention to proofreading would help eliminate minor errors and improve readability. Consider using simpler language to ensure the essay is easily understood by all readers, bearing in mind that clarity in writing is crucial for effectively conveying your ideas.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The author's viewpoint becomes somewhat muddled by the attempt to address both the positives and negatives of the topic in equal measure. For a stronger essay, clearly state your main opinion early on and consistently support it throughout the piece. This will provide your essay with a clearer direction and make it easier for readers to understand your stance.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay presents examples and arguments for both the benefits and drawbacks of household appliances. However, to enhance the essay, focus on developing more detailed and specific examples that directly support the chosen stance. Avoiding the presentation of contrasting arguments unless they are used to reinforce the main opinion would also help in maintaining a clear and persuasive argument.

Remember, a successful essay is not just about meeting a word count but about expressing a coherent and compelling argument within the set requirements. Editing and proofreading are crucial steps to refine your essay and ensure it clearly communicates your viewpoint.

Thus, I party approves that government should make it free for public transport users. \n As I mentioned above, Public transport like bus is one of the key elements to improve environment quality for reducing the amount of pollutant particles stem from cars and motorbike, cutting down the expenses the government has to pay to solve air pollution. In addition, lessening the number of vehicles on the streets solve traffic congestion, benefiting the countries where bottlenecks are commonly the norm. Besides, to make it possible, the government should raise tax to balance the fiscal budget, motivating people to travel by public transport since they have paid for their trip through taxes \n However, public transport includes not solely bus but also other expensive means of transport like train, ship and airplane, which cannot be totally funded by the state for the high price and not everyone travels by those vehicles every day, which makes it irrational for them to pay for the vehicles they do not use frequently. Hence, the policy should only apply for bus travelers who only need to travel in short distance. If the policy is approved by the state, not only the air quality will be benefited but the awareness of community will also grow since many poor people will be able to travel around easier. \n In short, state-funded bus can facilitates air quality and increase the sense of community of people in a country.

This is not a word or vocabulary test, this is a test of your analytical skills, presented in English, based on summarized but clearly explained discussion presentations.","The essay attempts to address the topic of whether public transport should be made free by the government, presenting arguments for state-funded buses as a means to improve air quality and foster community spirit. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to align more closely with the prompt and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

Firstly, the essay drifts from directly responding to the topic by adding personal interpretations and information that were not part of the original prompt. It's essential to stick closely to the provided topic, focusing on restating the issue in a manner that does not introduce new, unsupported perspectives. This ensures that the discussion remains grounded in the original context and that the arguments developed are relevant and well-supported.

Secondly, while the intention to provide a nuanced view is appreciated, the essay lacks a clear opinion, making it difficult for the reader to understand the position being argued. It's crucial to express a clear stance on the issue at the beginning and maintain this perspective consistently throughout the essay. Doing so provides a strong foundation for the arguments that follow and helps the reader follow the logic of the discussion.

In terms of structure and content, the essay struggles with wordiness and a lack of concise argumentation. Though it aims to present detailed discussions, the points made can be lost in overly complex sentences and paragraphs that struggle to get to the heart of the argument. A more effective strategy would be to focus on providing clearer, more direct statements that directly support the essay's main position. This approach not only makes the essay easier to follow but also allows for the presentation of arguments in a manner that demonstrates critical thinking and analytical skills within a well-structured format.

Furthermore, the essay encounters spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that impede readability. Attention to grammatical accuracy, proper spelling, and consistency in style can greatly enhance the overall quality of the writing. For example, maintaining the same tense throughout the essay and ensuring subject-verb agreement would contribute to a more polished and professional presentation.

Lastly, while the essay attempts to use descriptive arguments to support its viewpoint, these arguments need to be more clearly defined and directly linked to the essay's main stance. Supporting points should be presented logically and backed by evidence or clear reasoning that solidifies the author's position.

In summary, focusing on a clear and direct response to the prompt, improving language accuracy, and structuring the essay with concise, well-supported arguments will significantly enhance the effectiveness of the writing. By addressing these areas, the essay can more effectively communicate its position and engage the reader in a meaningful discussion on the topic at hand.",3,3,3,2,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Other people think that, in today's world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History.","Every subject taught in school is selected by considering their importance on the later of the students. While some people believe that History is one of the most crucial subjects, others argue that Science and Technology related subjects are more important. In this essay, I will discuss both views and explain why I think both subjects are necessary. \n History prepares a student for real life by delivering practical knowledge. By looking at the past, one can gain a vast knowledge. It can be used to get away with a similar situation happening again in the future. Because the students will have the knowledge beforehand by studying history, they can stay prepared for an identical event. For instance, by looking at the Bangladesh-Pakistan war in 1971, it is observed that we have to be united to bring justice against immorality. If the same scenario comes again, we can use this acquired knowledge from history to get on the winner side. The more prepared a student for the battle in practical life, the more possibility of his victory. \n With the recent technological advancement, a nation can be developed by utilizing science and technology. The population of the world is growing and the need for making tasks faster is also increasing. This has lead to an ever expanding field of applications of science and technology. Because science can make life easier and tasks faster with new innovations, it has become a crucial subject to study in recent times. Crops, for instance, need to grow faster to meet the needs of growing population of the world. This can be done by engineering the genes of the cereals. The more efficient a nation is with its tasks, the more it can be developed. \n To conclude, every subject has their own impacts on a student's career. While history can prepare him for upcoming real life events, science and technology can increase his efficiancy in executing a certain task. I believe both of them are crucial to make a student successful.","The first sentence is an incomplete thought. It should not be presented in the paragraph for 2 reasons: \n - It does not relate to the original discussion foundation \n - It is a personal opinion of the writer that should be presented in the writer's opinion sentence. \n The topic sentence of the prompt restatement should always follow the content of the original presentation, without any alterations or additional information. This sentence will force score reductions in terms of restatement accuracy. However, the essay will have limited deductions since the writer presented a strong personal opinion + summarized reason presentation towards the end of the paragraph. \n The student has not proven the 2 public opinions to be true or false, or of equal importance based on public opinion. The reason for the public opinion must first be stated, followed by the writer's opinion of that viewpoint. Either he supports it or not. His opinion should be effectively merged into the public discussion paragraphs. \n By including a clear explanation of his personal opinion in the concluding paragraph, the writer will cause the essay to get a failing score due to the lack of proper reverse paraphrase in the concluding summary. The essay is open ended rather than concluded in this current format.","The essay addresses the topic by discussing the importance of both History and Science and Technology in a student's education. Yet, improvements are necessary to make the argument more effective and aligned with the expectations of an English proficiency test. 

Starting with the introduction, the opening sentence introduces a general statement about the selection of school subjects but needs clarification and direct linkage to the essay's main argument. It's crucial for introductory sentences to precisely set the stage for the discussion that follows. In this case, more focus on explicitly stating the debate between the importance of History versus Science and Technology would be beneficial.

The essay does well in presenting arguments for both perspectives, which is a strength. However, the presentation of these arguments could be more structured. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence summarizing the argument that will be discussed. Following, providing evidence or examples to support this argument is essential. This structure helps readers follow your logic and understand the points being made.

One area for improvement is the depth and detail in explaining how each subject (History and Science and Technology) impacts a student's life and career. Merely stating benefits lacks persuasiveness without concrete examples or explanations of how these benefits come into play. For example, when mentioning that History prepares students for real-life situations by looking at the past, it would strengthen the argument to include how this understanding directly influences decision-making or problem-solving skills.

The conclusion attempts to summarize and present a final stance yet falls short of effectively paraphrasing and wrapping up the essay's central arguments. A more impactful conclusion would revisit the key points made in support of both History and Science and Technology, clearly stating their combined importance without introducing new information. It should also avoid sounding open-ended or as a repetition of personal opinion without summarizing the essay's key discussions.

Grammar and spelling are largely correct, but attention should be given to sentence structure and word choice for clarity and precision. For instance, ""the later of the students"" might be intended to say ""the future of students,"" and ""has lead"" should be ""has led."" Focusing on these details will enhance the overall effectiveness of the writing.

The first is fossil fuel consumption that is a leading cause of air pollution, posing a significant threat to the ozone layer. For example, millions of tons of hazardous gas emissions are released directly into the atmosphere from various industrial parks each month, exacerbating the polluted air - one of the leading causes of global warming. Second, deforestation has a detrimental impact on ecological balance. To illustrate further, illegal logging and clearing of trees, which are the key causes of habitat destruction, putting various animal species in great danger due to shelter and food scarcity. \n Various steps should be taken by the national governments and individuals to resolve these severe problems. Firstly, with the position of national leaders, governments should enforce tougher penalties on factories with unsuitable gas disposal systems. In turn, policymakers would promote the use of environmentally sustainable sources of energy, such as solar, wind and water, to make room for the burning of fossil fuels in the fight against global warming for environmental conservation purposes. The governments could then improve the management of forests and enforce more stringent laws to make forest thieves and forest destruction preventive to keep the natural environment secure. \n As individuals, we could help to improve the ""forest"" on Earth by engaging in local environmental conservation activities, such as ""no littering,"" ""planting trees"". In addition, we should purchase more energy-saving home appliances to reduce people's reliance on fossil fuels. Furthermore, to eradicate deforestation and guarantee the natural habitat of humans and animals, each citizen must comply with the government regulations. \n In conclusion, as described above, both national governments and individuals will play their part in making every possible effort to protect the environment on Earth in the fight against serious environmental problems.","Analyze the prompt you were given.

The response effectively addresses the topic, pinpointing how human endeavors like fossil fuel consumption and deforestation contribute to environmental issues. It also suggests measures that can be adopted by governments and individuals to mitigate these effects. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and adherence to the prompt:

1. **Addressing the prompt directly**: It's important to break down the prompt into specific questions that need to be answered directly in the essay. A more focused paraphrase of the topic at the beginning could help guide the essay's direction. Directly stating how human actions contribute to climate change and proposing specific solutions by governments and individuals right from the introduction would provide a clearer roadmap for the essay.

2. **Reducing word fillers**: Utilizing more direct and fact-focused language without word fillers can strengthen the essay. Phrases like “There are many contributors,” “The first is,” and “Various steps should be taken,” can be condensed to make statements more straightforward and impactful. This approach not only enhances clarity but also aids in creating a more cohesive and coherent discussion.

3. **Grammatical and stylistic issues**: There are some instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that should be addressed. For example, careful attention should be paid to verb tense consistency and sentence structure. Improvements in these areas can make the essay read more professionally and fluently.

4. **Expanding on arguments**: While the essay mentions several key points related to the destruction of the ecosystem and potential remedial steps, it could benefit from further development of these ideas. Providing more details, examples, and explanations would help fortify the arguments and make the author’s viewpoint clearer. It’s essential to explain why certain solutions are effective and how they can be implemented.

5. **Clarity of point of view**: The essay's point of view on the importance of both governmental and individual actions in addressing ecosystem damage is apparent but could be emphasized further. Demonstrating the interconnectedness of these actions and their potential cumulative impact could enrich the argument.

By directly addressing the prompt's questions with a focused introduction, minimizing the use of filler words for more concise statements, correcting grammatical inaccuracies, and fully developing ideas with detailed examples and explanations, the essay could present a more compelling and coherent argument.

Here are constructive points to enhance the written work:

1. **Response to Topic**:
   - The essay targets the topic by arguing that students should focus on subjects related to their vocational careers. This is a positive aspect, as the stance is clear. However, the essay would benefit from directly addressing the question without starting with phrases like ""It is true..."" which could seem subjective. Instead, simply state the point of view to maintain objectivity.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:
   - There are noticeable grammatical and stylistic errors that obstruct the clarity of the essay. For instance, starting sentences with lowercase letters and the inconsistent use of tense. Improving sentence structure and paying closer attention to grammar (like subject-verb agreement and proper punctuation) would enhance readability and comprehension.
   - Consider varying sentence structures to maintain reader engagement. Moreover, transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to guide readers through the arguments more effectively.

3. **Point of View Clarity**:
   - The essay's point of view is understandable; it supports specialization in subjects related to students' vocational interests. A stronger position could be established by quantifying the level of support (e.g., strongly support) and by providing a balanced examination by possibly acknowledging the value of a broader education before concluding in favor of specialization.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
   - While the selection of Master Chef as an example aims to illustrate the importance of vocational skills, it’s crucial to differentiate between formal educational settings and competitive or entertainment platforms. An example more relevant could involve vocational training programs or specialized schools that offer targeted, formal education.
   - Arguments could be further strengthened by comparing vocational education's benefits with the potential limitations of a generalized curriculum. However, it's essential to ensure relevancy to the vocational focus, avoiding broad dismissals of foundational subjects like Math, which may indirectly contribute to vocational skills.

**Additional Insights**:
- Emphasize the connection between vocational education and career prospects without dismissing the potential benefits of a well-rounded education. Discuss how specialized knowledge can complement general education to prepare students for the workforce more effectively.
- Providing tangible evidence or more concrete examples and data to support claims would make the argument more compelling and persuasive.

Therefore, in order to meet the community's need of collar-workers, there must be more people who are supported to land manual jobs. For example, the warranty of some public facilities like schools and hospitals,.. must be carried out by specialized workers. Secondly, if there are so many students leaning towards pursuing higher education, the unemployment rate will rocket because the labour market will not generate enough occupations for all of them. \n Furthermore, it is necessary that vocational training should be taken seriously in both families and schools. In terms of schools, vocational knowledge needed to be included in some curriculum activities or hands-on experiences with a view to providing students with the opportunity to gain insight into that fields not to mention that they may act as career orientation for pupils having intention to pursue that kind of works. Last but not least, it is time for parents to back their children up and give their offsprings assistance to attend programmes teaching them to be professional workers as a long-term goal to fulfil their ambition if children are drawn attention their attention to that specialization. \n In conclusion, I agree that we should encourage more students to be trained as professional workers since, without them, society can not function effectively.","The writer must never include a personal opinion when restating the prompt. There should not be any claims made pertaining to the truth of any statement because that will change the discussion presentation and alter the purpose of the discussion. This creates a seperation from the original prompt that would lower the score due to non-compliant paraphrasing. This is the end result of the first sentence in the first paragraph sentence presentation. Interpret the prompt as close as possible to the original without changing the original intent of the presentation. It must be pointed out though that the opinion thesis in the same paragraph accurately responds to the question. \n Proofreading is a requirement prior to the submission of any task. While the discussion is on point, the grammar issues in relation to word capitalization and punctuation mark usage will cost the writer serious deductions. As a reminder the first word of every new sentence/ paragraph is always capitalized. Ellipses, though creative and dramatic in function, is not used in formal academic writing. Finally, 2 punctuation macks cannot be used simultaneously in one sentence. Only one or the other can be used. Double punctuation usage is a very serious grammatical evor that shows a lack of English writing rules familiarity. \n The reverse paraphrase for the conclusion is also improperly - presented as it lacks a s of 40 words or 2-5 sentences, whichever comes first.","The essay addresses the topic effectively by arguing that students should be encouraged to pursue vocational training over tertiary education. This aligns well with the essay prompt, showing a clear understanding of the task at hand. The thesis is well-presented, directly responding to the question and setting a strong foundation for the argument.

However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to enhance its coherence, accuracy, and adherence to formal writing standards. Firstly, it's important to closely interpret the essay prompt without inserting personal opinions that could alter the initial intent. The introduction should neutrally present the topic before stating a personal stance, ensuring that the response remains faithful to the original discussion point.

On grammar, punctuation, and style, the essay demonstrates a need for more careful editing. Remember, the first word of every new sentence and paragraph should be capitalized. Formal academic writing typically avoids the use of ellipses (...) and double punctuation marks (e.g., ""..""). These are seen as informal and can significantly impact the essay's formality and clarity. Each sentence should end with a single, appropriate punctuation mark. 

Moreover, the conclusion of the essay could be strengthened. A conclusion should succinctly summarize the main arguments presented, reiterating the author's stance in a clear and impactful manner. Aim for a conclusion that is at least 40 words or 2-5 sentences long to properly encapsulate the essay's thesis and supporting points.

Additionally, while the essay's perspective is clear, and arguments supporting this viewpoint are presented, these could be further enhanced by more detailed examples and a clearer articulation of why vocational training is beneficial. It would also be advantageous to streamline the essay's arguments to ensure each point is distinct and robustly supported.

Lastly, it's crucial to take vocational training seriously within both familial and educational contexts, as highlighted. Emphasizing how schools and families can support students interested in vocational paths would not only strengthen the argument but also provide a more comprehensive view of its importance. 

Improving these aspects will not only refine the essay's structure and coherence but also significantly elevate its overall quality, ensuring it meets the criteria for English proficiency assessments.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Personally, I completely approve of this opinion and this essay will explain the reasons supporting my view. \n To begin with, technology has now played an indispensable role in our modern life. It is clear that technology has infiltrated every aspect of our life, changing how we learn, how we work and so on. Some occupations are even predicted to disappear in the future since robots may undertake those jobs instead of humans. As a result, learning computer skills at an early age could benefit children in their vocational paths as they will be equipped with computer techniques, which would be probably one of the paramount criteria when they apply for jobs. \n Moreover, knowing how to use computers enables pupils to access a wider information source through the internet, which facilitates their development in other subjects as well. Various types of information cannot be published in the forms of books or newspapers. In addition, getting knowledge only from those kinds of documents might be costly as people have to buy every single one for information. With the help of technology, it is much more straightforward and cheaper as well. For instance, pupils are able to find a huge amount of information about a specific topic with just a few clicks of a computer mouse. \n To sum up, I strongly believe that it is advisable to integrate computer skills into the elementary curriculum as one of the main subjects due to the advantages that it brings to pupils.","<quotation>and this essay will explain the reasons supporting my view.</quotation> \n What the examiner is looking for when he reads your opinion sentence is the basic reason behind it.

The arguments presented are relevant and support the point of view effectively. However, to improve the essay and make it more impactful, consider the following points:

1. **Clarifying and Strengthening the Thesis Statement**: Instead of stating that the essay will explain reasons supporting the view, directly present your main argument and reasons in the thesis statement. This approach makes your stance clear right from the beginning and sets a solid foundation for your essay. For example, state not only that you support including computer skills in the curriculum but also briefly mention why, such as its importance for future vocational opportunities and enhancing access to a wide range of information.

2. **Structuring Body Paragraphs**: Ensure that each body paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence that presents the main idea of the paragraph. This helps in organizing your thoughts and arguments effectively. In your first body paragraph, for instance, begin with the statement about how early computer skills training can benefit children in their future careers before delving into the details. This structure aids in maintaining a logical flow and keeping the reader engaged.

3. **Expanding the Conclusion**: The conclusion of the essay should be expanded to meet the word requirement and to effectively summarize the main points discussed. It’s crucial to not just state your opinion again but to also briefly reiterate the reasons behind your stance. This will not only fulfill the word count requirement but will also provide a strong and memorable close to your essay.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Considerations**: There are minimal issues in this regard, but always proofread your essay to catch any possible mistakes. Maintaining proper grammar and style enhances the readability and professionalism of your work.

5. **Language Simplicity and Clarity**: You’ve done well in communicating your ideas; however, ensuring that language is clear and simple is key for easy comprehension, especially for English language learners. This includes choosing straightforward words and structuring sentences clearly.

By taking into account these points, your essay can be significantly improved. It’s evident that you understand the topic and have valid opinions on the matter. Focusing on clear thesis statements, logical structuring of paragraphs, expanding conclusions effectively, and paying attention to language and grammar will make your essay stronger and more compelling.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

While multinational specialists argue that global warming is a natural phenomenon and human activity has no role in accelerating the pace of climate change, scientists have come out as winners by presenting facts based on historical trends. Scientist claim that the amount of green house gas emission increased sharply in the post industrialization era. They have gone a step further by demonstrating the adverse impacts of global warming on the planet. Climate change has made the arctic and Antarctica ocean to meltdown, compounding the problems for the environment and habitat. It poses great danger to the survival of many aquatic species, islands and may become the cause of water-borne diseases in future. Therefore collective responsibilities are required to save the planet from warming inordinately. Some of these include: reduction in green house gas emission and moving towards a sustainable clean energy including solar, wind and geothermal energy.","As I read this introduction, I found it wanting in terms of specific, introductory information. The first missing information would be the definition of global warming. A simple explanation of what it represents, in terms that non-scientific people can understand can help build the foundation of your research. The second aspect you need to present are the two sides of the discussion. You have described what global warming means to people who believe in it. but you did not define what it means to those who oppose this school of thought. Finally, what is the point of your essay? What is your thesis or motivation for this research / essay. What will you be discussing and offering proof of? That global warming exists? If so then explain what makes your presentation different from all the other papers that prove the phenomenon exists. What aspect of the research will you be presenting that has had little light shed on it in the past? What will be the basis of your information? Make your reader care about what you are writing instead of just sounding like a textbook copy of the global warming discussion.","Your essay on global warming is a significant effort to discuss a critical global issue. However, there are several areas where improvements could make your essay more impactful and clearer to the reader.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay addresses the topic of global warming, but it lacks a clear thesis statement. It's important to specify your main argument at the beginning. Are you trying to prove the existence of global warming and its human causes, or are you exploring solutions? Make sure your introduction includes what makes your perspective unique and why your essay is a must-read on the subject.

2. **Definitions and Clarity:** You begin by mentioning global warming but do not provide a definition. For a stronger foundation, include a simple explanation of global warming that anyone, including those not familiar with scientific terms, can understand. This will also make your essay more accessible and engaging to a wider audience.

3. **Exploring Different Views:** While you briefly mention the debate between scientists and multinational specialists, you didn't fully explore the viewpoint of those who are skeptical about human roles in climate change. Providing a balanced view of both sides will enrich your essay. Understandably, it's important to clarify your stance early on, but considering opposing views helps in creating a more comprehensive argument.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Overall, your essay is well-written, but small mistakes can distract the reader. For instance, ""Scientist claim"" should be ""Scientists claim,"" and ""green house gas emission"" is typically written as ""greenhouse gas emission."" Watch out for minor grammatical errors and consider breaking down long sentences for clarity. Simplifying complex ideas without losing their meaning can significantly enhance your essay's readability.

5. **Supporting Arguments:** You've done well to cite the impacts of global warming, such as the melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice. Expanding on these points with more examples or statistics could strengthen your arguments. Additionally, when proposing solutions like moving towards sustainable energy sources, providing specific examples or case studies could make your argument more convincing.

6. **Point of View:** Your point of view becomes clearer towards the essay's conclusion — a collective action against global warming. Consider stating your position more prominently in the introduction and consistently reinforcing it throughout the essay with evidence and examples.

7. **Engagement and Originality:** Finally, think about what makes your essay unique. What new perspectives are you offering? Why should the reader care about your take on global warming? Highlighting this early in your essay can captivate your audience and make your work stand out.

In summary, your essay has the potential to be a compelling piece on a crucial topic. By defining key terms, presenting a clear thesis, considering all viewpoints, and clarifying your unique angle, you can make your essay more informative and engaging.",4,4,4,3,3,3,2,3,4,1,Argumentative

It is considered by many that studying in a all boys or all girls school has some negative impacts on a child's life when they are grown up. I completely agree with this notion and in support of my view I will discuss the problems faced by both male and female students in this essay. \n One serious problem faced by the boys having studied in single gender schools is uneasiness while communicating to a girl. As a student spends a vast majority of his life in school and in an all boys school he can only get along with students of the same gender, he faces difficulties interacting with girls. Due to this many boys suffer from severe mental pressure when they enter college and see that the boys coming from a co-educational background have a better rapport with girls than they have. It badly affects them at such a critical juncture of their lives. \n Similarly, girls coming from a single-sex school feel nervous when they enter college or join the workforce which have people from both the genders. As they have not had the experience of working and competing with males,they feel dominated by the large number of men in college or workplace. They always prefer to be surrounded by female colleagues and try to avoid getting along easily with men ,which does not contribute to a healthy work environment. \n In conclusion, I agree with the notion that children studying in single gender schools face a lot of problems in life in terms of communication and confidence, compared to the ones studying in mixed gender schools.","Dear student, the complete prompt for this essay requires you to discuss both points of view and then deliver a discussion of your opinion. What you discussed in the essay focuses solely on your point of view. As such, your response will be considered only partially correct and receive the appropriate low score for the essay. The moment that you chose not to properly represent the instruction sentence in the opening statement, you already got the lowest possible TA score for this essay. Then the tangential discussion further lowered the TA score. This has created an extremely high possibility that, when combined with your low scores for the remaining criteria, that the work you did will not get a passing score. Always remember, the original prompt provides you with the outline for the discussion all you have to do is follow the format it is presented in. In this instance you had to make sure that your body of paragraphs contained: \n 1. A supporting point of view \n 2. A contradicting point of view \n 3. Your personal statement \n Since this essay focused only on your personal statement, you cannot get a high, passing score for this essay. The prompt requirement must be followed at all times if you are to gain a passing score. The problem, is that you do not seem to properly assess the prompt and its requirements. If you do not take the time to review the essay requirements, you may end up always just submitting partially correct essays such as this one.","The essay clearly addresses an important topic: whether single gender schools have negative impacts on a child's life. You've presented your viewpoint effectively, emphasizing the communication challenges and confidence issues faced by students from single gender schools when they transition to more mixed environments such as colleges or workplaces. Your examples are relevant and support your arguments well, offering a clear insight into the potential consequences of attending single gender schools. 

However, to fully respond to the essay topic, it's crucial to explore both sides of the argument. This includes discussing the potential benefits of single gender schools in addition to the drawbacks you've already presented. By doing this, your essay will provide a balanced view and adhere to the requirements of the prompt more closely. Remember, understanding and following the prompt's instructions is key to achieving a higher score. Integrating contrasting viewpoints doesn't mean diminishing your argument but rather showing a comprehensive understanding of the topic. 

While your points are indeed compelling, expanding your essay to include the advantages of single gender education could make your argument stronger and more balanced. For instance, some believe that single gender schools can reduce distractions, cater to gender-specific learning styles, and foster a supportive environment for personal development. Mentioning these points would not weaken your position but would show that you have considered all perspectives before concluding that mixed gender schools are more beneficial in terms of communication skills and confidence.

On a more technical note, there are a few areas for improvement regarding spelling, grammar, and style. For example, in places, there is a lack of commas where they are needed, such as after ""In different parts of the world"". Paying attention to such details can greatly enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay. Additionally, try to avoid using phrases like “a all boys or all girls school” and instead use “an all-boys or all-girls school” to maintain grammatical accuracy.

Finally, your point of view is clear throughout the essay, which is essential for a persuasive piece. Your conviction in the perspective you're advocating for is evident and strengthens the essay's effectiveness. 

In summary, focusing on exploring both sides of the argument as required by the essay prompt, refining the grammatical and stylistic aspects of your writing, and considering the inclusion of contrasting viewpoints will significantly enhance your future essays.

4. **Argument Support:** You provide arguments and examples, which is good. However, focusing on developing each argument with more detail and including more concrete examples could strengthen your essay. Each paragraph should ideally introduce one main idea, explain it, and provide evidence to support it.

5. **Essay Structure:** The structure of your essay needs attention. Both the introduction and conclusion are critical components of an essay. Your introduction should ideally be at least three sentences long, setting the stage for your discussion. Similarly, your conclusion should not be a single long sentence; it should summarize your main points and restate your position clearly, also in around three sentences or more. Adequately developing your introduction and conclusion will provide a framework that makes your arguments more compelling.

It would be better if you can add some sentence building exercises to your preparation tasks prior to starting on your essay practice topics.","The essay provided demonstrates a sincere attempt to explore personal growth over the past five years. The effort to relay personal experiences and reflections is commendable. However, to enhance the quality of the essay and better adhere to the requirements of an English proficiency test, there are several key areas that need attention.

1. **Directness and Relevance**: It's vital to address the essay topic directly from the start. Avoid unnecessary introductions or filler words. For an English proficiency test such as TOEFL, straightforwardness is valued over elaborate introductions. Ensure that your opening statements are focused on the essay prompt, introducing your key arguments or experiences related to your personal growth.

2. **Clarity and Development of Ideas**: Each paragraph presents an idea but often stops short of fully exploring it. While you list examples to support your statements, there's a missing link in fully explaining how these examples support your overall point. Use more transitional phrases, connective words, and sentences to better link your ideas and examples. This will not only help in making your paragraphs more coherent but will also provide a clearer line of reasoning throughout the essay.

3. **Grammatical Accuracy and Sentence Structure**: There are noticeable issues with tense inconsistency and sentence construction that hinder the understanding of your essay. Paying attention to the correct use of tenses is crucial. Furthermore, work on crafting complete and well-structured sentences. Incorporate sentence building exercises into your preparation to improve in this area.

4. **Vocabulary and Spelling**: While you've used a variety of vocabulary, be mindful of correct spelling (""physic"" should be ""physical appearance"", ""Iam"" should be ""I am"", and ""opprtunity"" should be ""opportunity""). Enhancing your vocabulary and paying attention to spelling will not only improve your essay's readability but also its professionalism.

5. **Point of View and Support**: Your personal viewpoint on how you've grown is clear, which is a strength of your essay. To make your arguments more persuasive, consider adding more detailed descriptions and specifics about how these experiences have impacted you. Reflect on why these changes are significant and how they have influenced your outlook or behavior.

In conclusion, your essay showcases a promising start with its clear intent to discuss personal growth. Focusing on directness, improving clarity and development of ideas, grammatical accuracy, and robust support for your viewpoints will substantially elevate the quality of your writing. Keep practicing, and consider incorporating these suggestions into your future essays for a stronger presentation of your ideas.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,Narrative
4039,https://essayforum.com/writing/behavior-schools-getting-worse-94978/,test,Essay about behavior in schools is getting worse.,"Nowadays, the number of secondary students who have bad behaviors increases as an emergency problem. There are many students who have been bullied during their school life, which lead to many severe consequences. This essay will discuss the reasons and propose the solutions. \n One of the most common reasons is the lack of attention from their parents. The family with full-time working parents do not have the ability to educate their child, therefore the children are not aware of the right things to do. They are left to their own devices and given very little guidance on how to behave, so many of them do not fear facing the consequences of their misbehaviors. If the parents do not teach their child how to respect adults, it can lead to a bad attitude towards their teacher at school. Parents must keep their eyes on their child by talking to them more often and spending time playing with them, as the result, the positive connection will be increased, and they will naturally share more about their daily life. \n Another reason for this problem comes from the ignorance of the teacher. Sometimes students have a fight, but teachers often take minor disciplinary action against them that does not solve the problem effectively. Therefore, teachers should be trained to deal with this situation and awarded if their students are bullied. A third reason is the mental issues from that child which can come from their living environment and relationship. If they are exposed to inappropriate movies at a very early age, they can be affected by the action from that movie which causes how they treat other people in real life. This can be solved by the control management from the parents of what they can access on the Internet. \n To sum up, bad behaviors at school are often closely related to a lack of discipline at home and the support from teachers. So, the parents should play a key role in educating their child and teaching them to avoid bad influence.","<quotation>secondary students</quotation> \n Do not refer to a particular educational level in your restatement. This was not indicated in the original prompt. Doing so will change the discussion focus and result in accuracy deductions for your first paragraph. \n <quotation>emergency problem</quotation> \n What emergency problem? This is another inaccurate restatement in your presentation. Perhaps you meant it is an emerging problem? Which is totally different from an emergency. Your word usage is obviously wrong, regardless of which word you actually wanted to use so you can expect LR deductions and GRA deductions for your writing errors. \n The essay will not get a passing score because you only discussed one aspect of the 2 discussion points. What happened to the solutions presentation? These solutions cannot be limited to just one liners or simple explanation references in the paragraph. You need to build on that presentation in the same manner as the reasons presentation.","Your essay addresses an important topic related to behavioral issues among students, emphasizing both causes and potential solutions. Your effort to examine the root causes from different perspectives—families and schools—is commendable. However, there are several areas for improvement that could make your essay more effective and aligned with English proficiency test standards.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity:**
It's important to remain closely aligned with the question or topic provided. Avoid specifying the educational level (i.e., secondary students) if the prompt does not explicitly focus on this group. This narrows the scope of your discussion unnecessarily and can lead to inaccuracies. Similarly, be cautious with your choice of words, such as ""emergency problem,"" which may not accurately convey what you mean. Consider using terms like ""emerging problem"" to more accurately describe increasing behavioral issues among students without implying an immediate crisis.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
While your essay flows well, some grammatical and stylistic errors need attention. For instance, be mindful of singular and plural agreements (e.g., ""The family with full-time working parents do not have"" should be ""families with full-time working parents do not have""). Precision in language use not only improves readability but also ensures your message is clearly understood. Avoid repetitions and strive for varied sentence structures to keep your writing engaging.

3. **Clear Point of View:**
Your stance on the issue is evident; you believe bad behaviors in students stem from various environmental factors, particularly involving parents and teachers. However, enhancing the clarity of your position with a well-defined thesis statement in your introduction could strengthen the overall impact of your essay.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
You've outlined several reasons for student misbehavior, which is good. However, each argument can be further developed with more specific examples and deeper analysis. Additionally, while you've proposed solutions, there's a need to expand on these with more detail and discuss their implementation. Each solution should be presented with clear steps and potential outcomes, showing a thorough understanding of how they address the root causes of bad behavior.

To improve, focus on defining your arguments more precisely and ensure that your solutions are as well-developed as your identification of problems. This will create a more balanced and persuasive essay. Remember, accurate, clear, and detailed writing is key to conveying your ideas effectively.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

This essay will emphasize some reasons behind this contradict event and also suggest several solutions which my modify the reality. \n To begin with, this serious problem has existed for some reasons in line with financial issues and other noticeable forces. In fact, those types of development have been invented and invested in order to stimulate the agriculture in developed countries while many developing countries whose major economy is agriculture cannot afford most of modern technologies. They still use mainly outdated methods in farming, resulting in poor crops with bring them a modest amount of produce or income which they have to manage to live on. Additionally, many regions must face other issues such as war and conflicts, climate change or poor natural resources preventing them from improving, making income or escaping from hunger. For example, a considerable number of nations in Africa have suffered from malnourished conditions because of their unpleasant weather which appears to bar them to doing farming properly or having productive crops. \n As a result, it is essential to alleviate the problem with possible solutions. In order to support poor people, it is believed that wealthy individuals or residents from industrial countries should join hand, raise fund, and allocate the budget and resources to places in need. Moreover, every individual should be educated about climate crisis, environment, war and conflicts, so that they can be aware of the importance of having a better planet. In other words when humans live in positivity and security, they can focus on working and making money. Thus, they can possess advances themselves in improving productivity in farming instead of waiting for donation or allotment from others. \n In conclusion, it is significant to identify the causes of hunger despite the improvement of technology and industry in agriculture.

You've focused on a relevant topic, discussing both the causes of this global problem and proposing solutions, which aligns well with the task given. However, there are several areas where improvements can help clarify your arguments and enhance the overall quality of your essay.

1. **Topic Relevance and Presentation**: It's essential to directly engage with the essay question without diverting into additional or broader topics such as the introduction of poverty without a direct tie to the agricultural context. Focus on closely examining the factors directly related to the essay's core question concerning agricultural advancements and hunger. Rather than signaling what the essay will do (""This essay will emphasize…""), it's more effective to dive straight into presenting your analysis and arguments.

2. **Paragraph Structure and Coherence**: The initial part of your main body paragraph could be more focused and direct. Ensure each paragraph offers clear discussion points right from the start, contributing meaningfully to your overall argument. Avoid broad or vague statements in the opening sentences of paragraphs; every sentence should work to further your point and develop your argument clearly and cohesively.

3. **Use of Fillers**: Aim for conciseness in your writing. Phrases like ""As a result, it is essential to alleviate the problem with possible solutions"" can be simplified to more directly state the solutions. Removing filler words or phrases will make your argument stronger and more direct, which is especially important in an essay format where brevity and clarity are valued.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your essay is generally well-written but watch out for minor grammatical and stylistic issues. For instance, ensuring subject-verb agreement and appropriate article use (a, an, the) can smooth out reading. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to maintain the reader's interest and further polish your writing.

5. **Clarity of Position and Argumentation**: Your point of view is discernible, and you've included several arguments to support your stance. To strengthen your essay, ensure that your arguments are not only clear but also thoroughly explained and supported with specific examples or evidence. For instance, when mentioning ""poor crops"" due to ""outdated methods in farming,"" providing a specific example or statistical evidence could enhance your argument's persuasiveness.

In terms of solutions, it’s admirable that you’ve thought about broader social issues like education on the climate crisis. Making a clear connection between these solutions and how they can directly impact agricultural productivity will make your argumentation more robust. For example, explaining how education on climate change can lead to better farming practices that adapt to or mitigate climate challenges.

By focusing on these areas for improvement, your essay can become a more compelling and clearer piece of writing that effectively communicates your understanding of the issue and your envisioned solutions.",4,4,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

While some people believe that they should give nations practical support and suggestion, I would argue that it is more beneficial when helpers provide them with money. \n Hands- on aid and advice brings about both positive and negative effects. In fact, it is a common way to pass well-accumulated knowledge and experience on to poorer countries of antiquated technology. Vietnam milk manufacturers, for example, have brought their domestic products to Europe, United States, Japan...,which is likely an incredible success, thanks to their application of standard process of feeding cows transferred by FAO- a famous universal association. On the other hand, it is clear that the more advice intercontinental institution provide for the third world, the more depending they become. Authorities will not have any motivation to be creative, hard-working and active to get to the bottom of national problems. In other words, their national destination depends on oversea consultancy; as a result, they are always in the boring circle of poverty regardless of foreign assistance. Furthermore, there are fundamental differences among nations and it turns out to be unsuitable for foreigners to apply their mindset to education incentives or diplomatic process in developing countries. \n By receiving money from international aid, the third world countries could easily utilize their own comparative advantages to gain economic success, which is the root of stable progress in any countries. Firstly, government are able to spend money building infrastructure, such as transport system, port facilities,... in order to attract more foreign investment. Secondly, if companies there are accessible to low interest of rate from the universal bank, they will take advantage of low-cost labor force, cheap raw material available in host countries to reduce manufacturing cost. Therefore, they might compete well with the challenging world market and make a great contribution to the economic prosperity. It is undeniable that financial help gives firm more and more chances to be successful in the long-term. \n To sum up, I believe that it is more advantageous for developing countries to receive money than practical aid and suggestion.","Dear student, please provide the complete prompt requirement every time you post your essay for review. The prompt requirement helps us to identify the points for analysis within your essay. I am able to do this without the prompt because of my familiarity with the exam questions. However, the others who are not familiar with the question but want to help you will be unable to do so. The prompt requirement is for their benefit. \n Now, as far as the this essay is concerned, the actual requirement is for you to do a comparison analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of giving international aid to poor countries. Based on that prompt requirement, this essay will immediately fall under the score range of 3 because you did not properly discuss the essay. There was no reference to a disadvantage within your essay and you made the whole presentation a personal opinion paper. Since your opinion is not required by the prompt, there was no need for your to take ownership of the discussion. Thus the failing score. Even your concluding sentence is not appropriate for the discussion. It is only a single sentence when the requirement is a minimum of 3 sentences. Writing 352 words in this essay is not going to help if you did not discuss the essay in the manner instructed by the prompt requirements.","This essay attempts to delve into the topic of whether providing money or practical aid and suggestions is more beneficial to developing countries. The essay is structured to favor financial assistance over practical aid, thus presenting a clear standpoint. However, there remain areas for improvement to make the argument more compelling and aligned with standard expectations for an analysis essay required by English proficiency tests.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
It's important to fully address the essay prompt by equally discussing the advantages and disadvantages of both forms of aid. While the essay briefly mentions the drawbacks of practical aid, such as creating dependency, it lacks a balanced discussion. The prompt requires a comparative analysis, so ensure both sides of the argument are explored equally and sufficiently. This will provide a comprehensive view and meet the requirement of discussing the topic in the manner instructed.

2. **Clarity and Structure:**
The essay would benefit from a clearer introduction of the argument and a more structured approach to presenting points. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea, supported by examples or explanations. For the conclusion, instead of summarizing the argument in just one sentence, aim for at least three sentences that recap your analysis and underscore the essay’s main points, solidifying your argument.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
There are several grammatical errors and punctuation misuses throughout the essay, such as the misspelling of ""consider"" and incorrect punctuation around lists (e.g., ""Europe, United States, Japan...""). Also, the use of ""it is"" can be contracted to ""it's"" in some cases to create a smoother reading experience. Be mindful of using clear and proper English to enhance the readability and professionalism of your writing.

4. **Point of View and Arguments:**
Your point of view is clear but it's presented as a personal belief rather than a well-supported argument. To avoid making the essay feel like a personal opinion piece, integrate more factual evidence, statistics, or case studies to back up your claims. This approach will add weight to your argument and demonstrate a deeper analysis of the topic. 

By addressing these points, the essay can be significantly improved. Aim for a balanced discussion, correct grammatical errors, structure the essay clearly, and support your arguments with evidence. This approach will not only meet the exam requirements more closely but also create a more persuasive and well-rounded analysis.",3,4,4,3,3,3,2,3,4,1,Argumentative

This essay will show you the reason for this issue as well as propose solutions to it. \n Many causes lead to this consequence. Firstly, many parents currently omit the importance of paying attention and giving affection to their children, They are so devoted to their work that they forget to spend time listening and teaching their sons and daughters about the right behavioural values. On this account, teenagers will feel that they are ignored, which contributes to their bad acts to get attention. Secondly, children are easily influenced by others. For example, if they have friends who are impulsive, disorganized, and irresponsible, they will gradually conduct themselves in the same way that seems comparable with their friends. \n On the other hand, there are numerous solutions to this problem. Firstly, you can endeavor to persuade them to make a change. By caring for them and conveying such doom and drawbacks that might come if they continue to behave in that way. Gradually, you can reset their attitude towards the world with moral values. Secondly, you can urge them to make new friends with good personalities. This can have a good impact on children, which tends to help them to shape into such good behaviors and develop their self-improvement as well as self-discipline. \n In short, there are many complaints about immorality and the lack of self-discipline among teenagers, which clearly show that this issue is very serious.

Your approach to outlining both the causes of this problem and potential solutions is commendable. However, to enhance your essay and make it more impactful, consider the following points:

1. The essay's introduction should offer a clearer stance or opinion on the topic. While you introduce the issue well, directly stating your viewpoint or presenting a thesis statement could strengthen your position. This approach helps readers understand your perspective right from the beginning.

2. Your first paragraph discussing the causes is strong, but the explanation of the second cause could be further developed. Focusing on elaborating this point with more details or examples could enrich your argument and provide a more balanced analysis of the causes.

3. The transition from discussing the causes to the solutions could be smoother. Instead of using ""On the other hand,"" which implies a comparison between two sides of the same argument, a phrase like ""Based on these causes, a possible solution that can be considered is..."" would more accurately connect your discussion points. This would clarify that you are moving from identifying problems to suggesting solutions.

4. When proposing solutions, it's important to specify who should implement these changes. Your solutions are thoughtful, but clarifying whether parents, educators, or the community should take action would make your suggestions more practical and understandable.

5. Your conclusion does a good job of summarizing the issue and the necessity of addressing it. However, reinforcing your own viewpoint or recommendations here can leave a more lasting impression on the reader.

The difficulty in merging these ideas are what lowers the score for the essay.","The essay attempts to address an important topic: the factors that contribute to job satisfaction and their practical application in the workforce. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make the argument stronger and clearer.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay starts with a broad statement about people working for a living and seeking job satisfaction, which is relevant. Yet, the introduction lacks a clear focus and fails to outline the main reasons discussed later. To improve, it would be beneficial to briefly mention the three main reasons at the start. This would set a clearer direction for the essay and help readers understand what to expect.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:**
The essay contains some grammatical and stylistic issues that could be improved. For example, the phrase ""one above of the things"" is confusing and likely intended to be ""one of the things."" Additionally, ""experiment"" seems to be used instead of ""experience,"" and ""it helps to the arousal of people"" could be more clearly expressed as ""it boosts people's motivation."" Simplifying sentences and checking for correct word usage can greatly enhance clarity and readability.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:**
The author's viewpoint is somewhat clear - job satisfaction is essential and influenced by several factors. However, the use of tentative language like ""might"" weakens the confidence in this stance. Asserting opinions more confidently, without hedging, would strengthen the author's position.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
The essay lists three reasons contributing to job satisfaction but struggles to integrate them into a cohesive argument. Each reason is mentioned, but there's a lack of detailed examples supporting how these reasons interconnect and contribute to overall satisfaction. To enhance the essay, it would help to elaborate on how these reasons relate and affect one another, providing specific, real-life examples where possible. An improvement could be to describe how a supportive work environment not only enhances productivity but also increases job satisfaction, leading to better performance and potentially higher wages.

5. **Overall Cohesion and Coherence:**
The ideas presented are insightful, but the essay would benefit from a more organized structure that clearly ties these ideas together. A more cohesive presentation that smoothly transitions from one idea to the next would greatly assist in communicating the argument more effectively. 

In summary, focusing on a clearer introduction, using simpler and more precise language, confidently stating opinions, providing more interconnected examples, and enhancing the essay's overall cohesion are key steps for improvement.

In my perspective, despites its evident benefits, vegetarian diet should not be compulsory for all diets. \n On the one hand, certain healthy benefits can be obtained as a result of enjoying vegetarian diet. Firstly, it contains a huge source of vitamins or minerals. Therefore, by placing plants foods on daily diet, there will obviously be a fall in other foods' expenditure with the similar purpose of giving adequate nutrition to support our body. Secondly, also by its nutrients content, people surely get less chance of being suffered from those diseases like cancer or obesity by consuming vegetarian diet. For instance, Japanese elderly residents are widely known with the healthy appearance since their diet always contains a huge source of vegetables. \n On the other hand, rather than being applied widely, vegetarian diet contains numerous drawbacks for some certain eaters. To begin with, enjoying meat refers to a favorable eating habit that majority of people fail into. Because the tastes value exceeds the 'costs', thus, those are in favor of meat consuming might not be willing to take an exchange for their favorable choice of diet. Furthermore, beef or pork are known as the most valuable source of protein and other nutrients. Hence, if they are excluded from the diet, healthy body will surely not be ensured. For example, back to the past days, majority of people had been suffered from malnutrition since their only available source of food was vegetables. \n By way of conclusion, although containing evident benefits like providing vitamins or minerals, I believe that consuming vegetarian diet is not for everyone, especially those who are under sufferance of malnutrition.","this is an opinion essay.

The correct paraphrase for this prompt is: \n <em>There is an ongoing discussion as to whether or not all people should shift to a vegetarian diet. This is based on the information that a carnivorous diet is not necessary in order to eat a health beneficial diet. In my opinion, not everyone should be forced to follow a vegetarian diet just because a particular sector of society believes that vegetarianism has more benefits.</em> \n Remember, you are being scored on your paragraph accuracy in terms of content, alignment with the original prompt, and your thesis statement based upon the original discussion instructions. These should be accomplished in no less than 3 sentences. Your opening statement falls short and does not accurately paraphrase the prompt in the process. What I presented above is the most accurate presentation of the original prompt. \n Now, since the prompt is asking you to give your opinion, this is supposed to be a one sided discussion. Not a two sided discussion as you presented in your essay. For the one sided discussion of your opinion, you need to have a strong 3 paragraph discussion that indicates one topic sentence per paragraph that is supported by at least 2 reasoning sentences and one example sentence in order to support your point of view. \n What you did wrong in this essay is that you provided a 2 sided comparative discussion, which does not equate into a point of view essay. As such, your essay became faulty and will most likely not receive a passing score because you did not offer a proper opinion discussion in the essay.

Here are specific suggestions for improvement:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay attempts to address the topic of whether a vegetarian diet is preferable for everyone. However, it's crucial to explicitly state your opinion in the introduction. A more effective approach would involve clearly expressing from the start that you don't believe shifting to a vegetarian diet is suitable for everyone. This will provide a stronger foundation for your arguments and ensure your essay directly responds to the prompt's question.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few minor spelling and grammar errors throughout your essay (e.g., ""plants foods"" should be ""plant foods"" and ""despites"" should be ""despite""). Also, consider using simpler and clearer sentences to convey your ideas more effectively, keeping in mind that coherence and accuracy are essential for a compelling essay.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay intends to express a personal viewpoint, which means it's important to use first-person pronouns (""I"", ""my"") to clarify that these are your personal beliefs and insights. This approach will help differentiate your personal opinion from a general discussion and strengthen the persuasive element of your essay.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While the attempt to present both sides of the argument is appreciated, the essay prompt asks for a discussion based on your personal opinion. Your essay would benefit from focusing solely on the reasons supporting your viewpoint that a vegetarian diet shouldn't be mandatory for everyone. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence followed by supporting arguments and examples. For instance, instead of discussing the benefits of a vegetarian diet, concentrate on explaining why it might not be suitable for everyone, using specific examples and reasons to back up your opinion.

To further improve, consider structuring your essay into three main paragraphs after the introduction: one for outlining your main argument, another for providing detailed reasons, and a third for offering examples or evidence. This structure will help keep your essay focused and enhance the persuasion of your argument.

Hurricanes and flooding can destroy crops, leading to poor yields and transportation difficulties. Additionally, climate change can damage infrastructure, including factories, resulting in job losses and state budget deficits. \n On the other hand, changing weather conditions can present positive growth opportunities for many companies.

It presents arguments for how climate change can offer new opportunities, despite its potential to harm businesses, especially in agriculture and infrastructure.

Firstly, the essay responds to the topic by addressing the varying perspectives on climate change's impact on business. However, it could be improved by directly stating a thesis statement that outlines the author's main argument or position upfront, rather than implying it will explore both perspectives. This approach would make the essay's direction and stance clearer from the beginning.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written but could benefit from more varied sentence structures and transitions to enhance readability and flow. Additionally, avoid unnecessary statements, such as ""This essay will explore both perspectives,"" after already introducing the topic. Instead, directly dive into the discussion to keep the reader engaged.

The point of view is somewhat clear, with the author leaning towards the belief that climate change can present new job opportunities. However, the essay lacks a strong, explicit expression of personal opinion or reasoning behind this viewpoint. Strengthening the essay with a clear thesis statement and providing specific reasons for supporting one perspective over the other would make the argument more convincing and the author's position more prominent.

While the essay lists negative and positive effects of climate change on business, these points could be deepened with more detailed examples, evidence, or analysis. For the negative impacts, more insight into how these challenges could be mitigated or turned into opportunities would add depth. For the positive impacts, including more concrete examples of industries thriving due to climate change and explaining why these opportunities arise, would strengthen the argument.

In conclusion, the essay somewhat addresses the topic and presents arguments for both sides. To improve, it should include a clear thesis statement, elaborate more on the reasons behind the author's viewpoint, and offer deeper analysis and examples. Making these adjustments will not only clarify the author's position but also provide a more engaging, compelling, and complete discussion of the topic.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic:** It's crucial to adhere strictly to the essay prompt. If the task requires you to take a stand or choose a side, focusing on both positives and negatives without clearly stating your position can be seen as not fully answering the question. Decide on one perspective to develop thoroughly in your essay. This focused approach will demonstrate your ability to follow instructions and argue effectively for a single point of view.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are several spelling and grammatical errors in your essay. For instance, the word ""nowadays"" should have a capital ""N"" at the beginning of a sentence. Also, ""dont"" should be written as ""don't"" with an apostrophe to denote the contraction for ""do not.""

While hamburgers and chips become a frequent choice for modern citizens, I firmly hold the opinion that the damaging effect of international fast food on individuals and society on the whole cannot be overlooked. \n It is claimed that fast food undermines people's well-being by overlooking nutrition values. To produce a flavor that raises customers' appetites, the restaurants usually use a shocking amount of salt, oil and sugar, which might encourage diseases such as diabetes or obesity. What is worse, there have been breaking news exposed over the years saying the meat of fried chicken wings comes from genetically modified monsters that have six wings and eight legs. Whether it is true or not, the credibility of food resource in some restaurants is very limited. \n Moreover, the spreading of international fast food makes cultural diversities fade away. The emergence of local food is due to the geographical traits of that place and the dietary habits of residents. Therefore, it symbolizes the culture and traditions to a large extent. If one day, sushi and spaghetti were all replaced by hamburgers and hot dogs, people would regret about the gross loss of cultural identities. \n The time-saving fast food, however, might be more suitable to the high-paced modern society. The streamline-prepared food can be served to the customers in less than one minutes. In addition, the dining time also shrinks since people can finish their meal while walking or working. \n To sum up, even though fast food saves a lot of time for modern citizens, their harmful influence on nutrition values and cultural conservation cannot be ignored. While the trend of frequenting fast food restaurants seems inevitable, traditional food should at least have a place on the dining table.","Dear student, you did not accurately paraphrase the prompt requirement and you totally misunderstood the discussion consideration as well. The correct paraphrase for your essay is as follows: \n <em>International fast food is believed to be speedily replacing traditional foods in most countries. There is a public believe that this steady increase in the popularity of fast food will result in a negative effect on families and societies. I totally disagree with this statement due to some factors that need to be considered in terms of food preferences of countries. Specifically, the food preferences of my own people in (name of your country).</em> \n This type of opening paraphrase shows that an analysis of the topic presented was done and that you considered all angles when it came to the food preference discussion in relation to traditional and fast foods. Your essay is nowhere near this required discussion, which is the required discussion because you made a mistake in your paraphrasing and as such, did not accurately represent the expected essay response. You presented an opinion essay based on a prompt discussion that you developed for yourself, which is not based on the original instructions provided. The important missing element in your opening statement that changed your discussion was ""I totally disagree..."" Keywords taken from the original prompt and used in the paraphrase will always help guide and outline your discussion. I hope you remember to do that with your next test. \n The conclusion is also faulty as you were not able to properly sum up the given discussion by restating the prompt, stating a summary of facts from the discussion, and then repeating your disagreement in the end. That is all that is required in the concluding statement. Never give an additional discussion as it will not be considered a concluding statement and you will lose points for it.","Your essay addresses the impact of international fast food chains on individual health and cultural diversity. While you bring up crucial points regarding the potential negatives of fast food, it appears there's been a misunderstanding of the original essay prompt. To enhance your essay, consider these key points:

1. **Essay Response to Topic**: It's fundamental to align your essay closely with the provided prompt. In this case, the focus should be on whether international fast food is replacing traditional foods and the implications of this on families and societies. A more accurate approach would start by discussing the widespread acceptance of fast food in contrast to traditional diets and then elaborate on its effects. Make sure to include a specific examination of food preferences in different countries, particularly focusing on how these preferences impact traditional culinary practices.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: Your essay is well-written, with a good command of English. However, to make your arguments even clearer, pay attention to transitions between paragraphs for a smoother flow. Also, when making significant claims, like the one about genetically modified ""monsters,"" make sure to clarify it's a hyperbolic or hypothetical example to avoid confusion about the credibility of your arguments.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your stance against the negative impacts of fast food is clear throughout the essay. However, remember to frame this viewpoint within the context of the prompt. Explicitly stating your position in relation to the prompt's specific focus at both the beginning and the end of your essay will strengthen its coherence and relevance.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: You provide vivid examples to support your position, such as the health risks associated with high levels of salt, oil, and sugar, and the cultural erosion posed by the dominance of fast food. To further enhance your essay, consider including counter-arguments or acknowledging instances where fast food might not always negatively affect local cultures and traditional foods. This balanced view can enrich your discussion.

In your conclusion, instead of introducing new ideas, aim to succinctly summarize your main points and restate your stance in relation to the prompt. Remember, a good conclusion reinforces what has been discussed without veering into new territory.

Lastly, integrating specific details about food preferences in your or others' countries can provide a more grounded and comprehensive discussion on the topic. This approach will not only adhere more closely to the prompt but will also offer a richer, more nuanced exploration of the subject matter.

Both of these opinions have their merits; however, I am on the side of developing other areas such as welfare services. \n It is undeniable that having a huge national budget is the key to rule every aspect of a country, and that is the common reason for nations to invest most of their money in progressing the economy. For instance, either building infrastructure and housing for citizens or buying weapons to protect the nation need money. In fact, these areas account for a huge proportion of the budget.

You effectively introduced both perspectives on this issue and clearly stated your position in favor of developing welfare services alongside economic progress. Your ability to compare these opinions and articulate your own thesis shows strong comprehension and restatement skills. This sets a solid foundation for your argument, highlighting your English proficiency and your capability to engage with complex discussions. 

However, the organization of your essay could be improved to enhance clarity and make your arguments more compelling. While you succeeded in presenting both points of view and your own stance, structuring your essay into a clearer three-paragraph format would strengthen your argument. Ideally, each paragraph would focus on a single topic: the first on the importance of economic progress, the second on the value of welfare services, and the third on your personal viewpoint, reinforcing why it holds merit. This approach would not only make your essay more coherent but also ensure that each argument is given adequate attention and development.

Moreover, while your examples, such as the reference to Bhutan, help illustrate your points, being more explicit about how these examples support your argument could further elevate your essay. For instance, detailing how Bhutan's approach to welfare services directly impacts its citizens' productivity and subsequently the economy could provide a stronger bridge between your factual evidence and your thesis statement.

In terms of language use, your essay is largely well-written. However, paying closer attention to spelling and grammar, and varying your sentence structure could enhance readability and flow. Phrases like ""It is undeniable that having a huge national budget is the key to rule every aspect of a country"" could be simplified for clarity and impact, for example, ""A large national budget is crucial for governing a country effectively.""

To conclude, your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear and supported opinion. By focusing on improving the structure of your essay, clarifying the support for your arguments, and refining your use of language, you can make your essay even more persuasive and effective.

However, I disagree that we should compel all teenagers to do charitable work. \n Most teenagers are students, who have been already under great pressure with their studies. In school, they have many subjects and skills to learn; even after school, they also need to do a lot of homework and practice exercises for exams, let alone some of them have to go to part-time work in order to share household expenses of their families. When young people do have some free time, we should let them relax themselves, or encourage them to explore and develop their own interests. In short, I think their priorities should be their studies and make good preparations for their future life. \n At the same time, I have my doubts that our society can gain anything from obliging young people to do unpaid work. If people do good deeds not from the bottom of their hearts, it loses its meaning. \n This not only goes against the values of a free and fair security but also leads to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they are just used. We should inspire them to help others willingly, instead of forcing them by moral coercion. \n In conclusion, it is wrong that making it mandatory for all teenagers to do unpaid work in their leisure time, and in my opinion they have rights to choose whether they want to do it or not.","In the opening paraphrase, you should add another 2 sentences that outline your discussion topic. Give the reason for your response as: \n <em>However... work. Consider that teenagers face academic obligations that take most of their time, leaving almost no time for them to rest. Society may not benefit from their volunteer service because of the academic stress they face daily.</em> \n When you give an outline of the discussion topics, you respond directly to the questions being given in the essay. These are requirements under the TA section because it shows the clarity and support you have for your single opinion within the presentation. \n Your first reasoning paragraph is well developed, uses good examples, and provides a clear explanation of the reasons and examples provided. It is a good explanation for your opposition to the suggested community service. \n However, the second paragraph that explains why society will not benefit from community service is either ill formatted in this presentation or, you accidentally hit the enter button before you should have. It appears that you have 2 separate paragraphs in response to that question, with neither paragraph being properly developed and explained. It weakened the essay presentation.

That is too bad. It had the potential to be an above average scoring essay. That chance was ruined by the improperly presented second reasoning paragraph. \n Your discussion summary / concluding paragraph is a not an effective presentation. It is only a long sentence that does not reiterate the previous discussion points as required by that paragraph format. There is a topic presentation but no reasoning presented in response to the questions (short form presentations of the topic sentences), and no repeat of your personal opinion as required by the presentation.","Your essay addresses the topic by presenting a clear stance on whether young people should be compelled to volunteer for community service. You have articulated your viewpoint well, asserting that teenagers, due to their academic obligations and personal interests, should not be mandated to perform unpaid work.

To further enhance your essay, consider beginning with a more detailed introduction. Adding two sentences to outline the discussion topics, including the reasons for your stance, can offer readers a clearer preview of your arguments. This approach not only strengthens your opening but also ensures direct engagement with the essay question, showcasing the organization and depth of your argument.

In terms of content, your first reasoning paragraph is notably strong. It effectively employs examples to illustrate the pressure of academic commitments on teenagers, making a compelling case against mandatory community service. This part of your essay demonstrates your ability to develop a coherent argument supported by relevant details.

However, your discussion on how society may not benefit from forced volunteerism by young people requires further development. The segmentation of your argument across two paragraphs disrupts the flow and dilutes the strength of your stance. Combining these segments into a single, more cohesive paragraph, and incorporating a clear, relevant example could significantly enhance your argument's impact. Such revision would improve both the clarity and cohesiveness of your essay, potentially raising its overall effectiveness.

The conclusion of your essay would benefit from a more structured recapitulation of your main arguments. Instead of concluding with a lengthy sentence, aim to succinctly reiterate the key points discussed and reaffirm your position. This not only reinforces your viewpoint but also ensures a more polished and impactful conclusion.

Lastly, watch out for minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could detract from the readability of your work. For instance, careful proofreading could help in avoiding errors like ""concider"" instead of ""consider,"" and ensuring consistency in terms like ""community service"" versus ""charitable work.""

In summary, your essay presents a well-defined perspective supported by logical arguments. By refining its structure, developing its content more fully, and polishing its presentation, you can further enhance its effectiveness and persuasiveness.

Concerning the structure, the essay presently consists of a single, extended paragraph. This format can be overwhelming for readers and might obscure your main points.

For instance, the flow of your sentences could be more natural, and careful proofreading would help identify and correct these errors.

The perspective conveyed in the essay is clear — highlighting the success of traffic management solutions in developed countries and suggesting their application in Ho Chi Minh City. Nevertheless, expanding on each proposed solution with more details and concrete examples would make your viewpoint even stronger and more persuasive.

In terms of arguments, you've laid a good foundation by suggesting certain measures like stricter enforcement of traffic laws and improvements to the public transport system.

Enhance your arguments with examples from other countries, and refine your language use and stylistic choices through careful proofreading.

Everything always has advantages and disadvantages, and there are some people have an idea that is banning smartphones in public because of its bad influence such as using phone to listen to music while driving a vehicle can make a bad accident or using cell phone to call someone in library is too annoying, and so on. Those reasons are not totally wrong but I still believe in advantages of smartphones in public. Therefore, I personally think there is no need to ban smartphones in public. \n Firstly, using smartphones in public still have a big advantage that may relates to live or dead. For example, if someone is in dangerous and in the verge of death that means that person is in emergency and need help, he/she can use a phone to ask for helping from his/her family or someone he/she trust. If banning using phones in public, that person in the example is hard to survive. Therefore, smartphones can be saviours of people in some situations. \n Secondly, sharing something interesting by smartphones can connect people with people to be more friendly, not only talking together simply. It is imaginable that some friends are meeting and gathering in a coffee house for celebrating some successful events. Those friends did events successfully and definitely took some funny and happy photographs while preparing for events. And now, they can talk about that time and open pictures taken before to recollect some exciting activities they did. That can make the meeting more impressive and happier. Smartphones can help people more united in public place. \n In conclusion, because using smartphones in public still have such a lot of advantages, I think we should not ban them. The point here is the person who use it with which consciousness he/she has. Smartphones do not have faults.","<quotation>common phenomenon</quotation> \n You cannot refer to the regular usage of an item as a common phenomenon because those are 2 contrasting word meanings: \n Common - widespread, general, or universal \n Phenomenon - an occurence of an extraordinary observable nature \n So, if the usage of mobile phones are considered common, it cannot be considered a phenomena. Kindly check the word meaning against the way you want to use it next time. Make sure the words you use in combination refer to the same or improved meaning of the idea you wish to convey. \n <quotation>listen to music while driving a vehicle</quotation> \n This is a private act, not a public act. If one is driving a vehicle as in a private car, then the reference is incorrect. If one is driving a taxi, bus, or specified form of public transport then it is a public action. There is again, a problem with the way the writer references the words. He shows a lack of word meaning and inability to properly use the word references. \n Let us put is this way, the writer has the right ideas, but is unable to properly form word and sentence structures to convey what he wishes to say. Language development exercises with regards to grammar structure are in order.

The argument in favor of not banning smartphones in public areas is clear, and the essay provides examples to support this viewpoint. However, there are several areas where this essay could be significantly improved to enhance clarity, accuracy, and persuasiveness.

1. **Clarity and Accuracy of Expression:**
   - The phrase ""common phenomenon"" to describe the widespread use of smartphones mixes contrasting meanings. While ""common"" suggests something usual or widespread, ""phenomenon"" implies something extraordinary or remarkable. A more accurate expression might be ""widespread use"" or ""common practice"".
   - When discussing using a phone to listen to music while driving, the essay refers to it as a public act, which could be misleading. The act of driving and using a phone in a private car is generally considered private. It's important to accurately distinguish between public and private behaviors to strengthen the argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   - There are instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., ""have an idea that is banning smartphones"" and ""using smartphones in public still have a big advantage"") that could confuse readers. Using simpler and more precise language could help. For instance, ""some people suggest banning smartphones in public due to their potential for distraction"" is clearer.
   - Consistent use of verb tenses and subject-verb agreement will also improve the readability of the essay.

3. **Point of View and Argumentation:**
   - The essay successfully conveys a personal viewpoint, advocating against banning smartphones in public areas. However, elaborating further on how conscious and responsible usage can mitigate potential disadvantages could strengthen the argument.
   - Providing more varied examples or statistics could also enhance the essay's persuasiveness and offer a more comprehensive view of the advantages of smartphones.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Focus on improving language skills, particularly grammar and vocabulary, to clearly express ideas. This includes understanding the precise meanings of words and phrases and their correct usage in the context.
   - Develop arguments more thoroughly with additional examples, details, and possibly counterarguments to anticipate and address opposing viewpoints.
   - Structure the essay with clear, distinct paragraphs for each main point, ensuring each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and supporting sentences that follow logically.

By refining these areas, the essay can offer a more compelling and clear argument, effectively communicating the benefits of smartphone use in public spaces without overlooking potential drawbacks.",3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4052,https://essayforum.com/writing/important-develop-public-parks-sports-95847/,test,IELTS TASK 2 It is more important to develop public parks and sports facilities than shopping centre,"In the process of planning a new town, either building public parks and sports facilities or shopping centers is more vital is the question often considered. Although shopping centers can be attractive to many residents, I think that developing those big constructions is not as important as developing the two other infrastructures. \n Public parks and sports facilities are more important for a reason. Parks preserve the quality and the health of our living environment. A lot of trees are planted there to provide fresh air and filter the atmosphere for the city dwellers, which ensures the town is a safe and peaceful place to live in. Sports facilities keep the residents living there healthy and happy. The availability of sports centers will encourage and provide opportunities for people to exercise, which is essential for a good mind and a healthy body. \n Meanwhile, the shopping center is not as essential since people only come here to entertain themselves in their free time. It mainly serves as a place for people to buy a range of items from retail shops, department stores, and especially boutiques. This may be good for the economy but does not contribute to the health of the city dwellers, the most important aspect of a well-developed town. Moreover, building these sites requires a lot of money, which is better spent on other facilities that enhance citizens' lives, especially in a newly planned town that does not have any cash inflow yet. \n In conclusion, I strongly believe that the construction of open parks and sports facilities should be prioritized over shopping centers as it can improve the health and the life quality of the residents living there.","<quotation>I think t</quotation> \n This does not offer a measured response. It shows that you do not have a clear opinion to support instead. A measured response is ideally presented as: \n - I strongly... \n - I emphatically... \n - I wholeheartedly... \n To name but a few measured response phrases that can be used to show that you have a solid opinion, rather than an uncertain point of view. An uncertain point of view will result in an automatically failing TA score, making it impossible for you to pass the test based on the remaining scoring considerations. \n <quotation>I strongly believe</quotation> \n This is your proper opinion presentation. It cannot be presented in the conclusion. Doing so will result in an automatically failed essay score because the requirements of the concluding summary were not followed in the final paragraph.","This essay clearly outlines why public parks and sports facilities are considered more important than shopping centers in the planning of a new town. The response is directly related to the topic, showing a good understanding of the task. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Clarity and Strength of Opinion**: The essay starts by posing a question but initially presents a somewhat hesitant stance on the importance of public parks and sports facilities compared to shopping centers. It's crucial to express a clear and strong opinion from the beginning. Phrases like ""I strongly believe"" or ""I am convinced"" should be used early in the essay to assert your position clearly and confidently. This approach not only sets a solid foundation for your arguments but also aligns with the essay requirements for a decisive opinion statement.

2. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the essay is well-written, but attention to detail in grammar, spelling, and style can further refine it. For example, ensuring verb tense consistency and correct article usage (""the shopping center"" vs. ""shopping centers"") can improve readability. Additionally, varying sentence structure and using a mix of simple and complex sentences could make the essay more engaging for readers.

3. **Clarity of Arguments**: The arguments presented in favor of public parks and sports facilities are compelling, emphasizing health, wellbeing, and environmental benefits. However, elaborating further with examples or statistical evidence could strengthen these arguments. For instance, citing studies on the impact of green spaces on mental health or community wellbeing could provide more depth and persuasiveness to your position.

4. **Point of View**: The point of view in the essay is clear but could be reinforced by consistently expressing a strong opinion throughout the essay, not just in the conclusion. Be sure to maintain this clear perspective in every part of the essay, underlining your arguments with conviction and evidence.

5. **Conclusion**: While the conclusion reaffirms the essay's main stance, integrating the strong opinion statement (""I strongly believe"") at the beginning as well as in the conclusion could ensure a more coherent and powerful ending. Remember, the conclusion is not just for summarizing but also for emphatically restating your position, thus leaving a lasting impression on the reader.

In summary, focusing on expressing a strong, clear opinion from the start, refining grammar and style, bolstering arguments with more detailed examples or evidence, and ensuring a powerful conclusion will greatly improve the essay. These adjustments will not only satisfy the test requirements but also engage and persuade your readers more effectively.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Mostly because you did not clearly present the overview of the prompt, you did not cover the key features of the discussion, and finally, your opening statement came across as unclear. Your coherence and cohesion might score around a 5 because, while there is a sense of coherence and cohesion, there is a lack of overall progression in the essay. You failed to use transition sentences between paragraphs. The transition sentences create the cohesive part of the essay as it connects one paragraph to another in terms of discussion and common points. The Lexical Resource could score no more than a 3 when you consider that there is a clear lack of ability to form understandable sentences. Grammatical range and accuracy might share the same score because errors in grammar and punctuation do not reflect the proper sentiment of the writer. That is mostly because of your lack of English speaking and writing ability. Not to worry though, you should improve over time provided you have constant practice.","The essay addresses the topic of whether family or school has a more significant impact on the upbringing and learning of children. However, the response to the topic could be clearer. The introduction does not effectively set up the argument or the essay's focus, making it difficult for readers to understand the main point. To improve, consider starting with a clear thesis statement that directly responds to the essay question, indicating whether the family or school plays a more critical role in a child's life and briefly why.

There are spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that hinder comprehension. For instance, ""upbringing and learning in a big society and Besides this"" features both capitalization and conjunction errors. The essay would benefit from paying careful attention to verb tenses (e.g., ""may will be raising"" should be corrected to ""may be increasing"") and proper sentence structure to ensure clarity and coherence. Reading the essay out loud or using grammar checking tools could help identify and correct these errors.

The point of view is somewhat clear – the argument leans towards the family having a more significant impact on a child's development than schooling. However, this point of view is not consistently supported or clearly articulated throughout the essay. Strengthening the argument would involve providing specific examples or evidence that clearly support why the family's influence is stronger and more beneficial.

The arguments lack clear and descriptive support. For example, the essay mentions the fundamental role of the family but does not delve into how or why this is the case. To improve, focus on developing each point with concrete examples, explanations, or research findings that back up the claim. This will not only make the essay more informative but also more persuasive.

The essay struggles with cohesion and coherence. Transition sentences that connect paragraphs and ideas are missing, making the essay's progression feel disjointed. Incorporating transitional phrases such as ""Firstly,"" ""In addition,"" and ""Consequently"" at the beginning of paragraphs—or when introducing new ideas—can improve the flow and make the argument easier to follow.

In conclusion, while the essay provides a standpoint on the importance of family in a child's upbringing compared to school, significant improvements are needed. Focusing on clarifying the response to the essay question, rectifying language errors, solidifying the argument with specific support, and enhancing the essay's structure will all contribute to a more effective and persuasive piece. Remember, constant practice and seeking feedback will lead to improvement over time.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Use the correct paragraph presentation and you should have better scoring considerations with the next essay.","This essay addresses an important topic: the factors influencing a child's development, comparing the impact of parents versus social factors outside the family. The essay attempts to explore both sides but leans toward emphasizing the role of parents in a child's life, which is a significant stance. However, there are areas for improvement to make the arguments clearer, more compelling, and aligned with English proficiency test standards.

Firstly, clarity and adherence to the essay prompt are crucial. It's beneficial to structure the essay to present each viewpoint in separate, clear sentences. If the essay is discussing two contrasting opinions, it would be clearer if each viewpoint were presented distinctly. For example, devote one paragraph to discussing public opinions or factors outside the family and another to discussing the parents' influence. This approach not only maintains task accuracy but also makes your position more apparent to the reader.

Regarding the positioning of your argument, it's advised to choose and consistently support one side in your essay. The introduction briefly mentions an agreement with the view that external factors play a crucial role, but the conclusion and majority of the content significantly focus on the parents' influence. This mixed message can confuse readers about your stance. Consider stating clearly which side you support and then use the body of the essay to explain why the opposing view is less convincing, thus strengthening your argument.

Stylistically, the essay would benefit from closer attention to spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Mistakes in these areas can detract from the credibility of your argument. For example, watch out for the correct use of capital letters (""i"" should be ""I""), and pay attention to punctuation within and between sentences to ensure clarity and flow.

Moreover, use a mix of first-person and third-person pronouns appropriately to meet the essay requirements. When sharing your perspective, ""I"" is suitable, but discussing general opinions or facts, ""they"", ""children"", or ""parents"" might fit better.

To strengthen your arguments, it is crucial to delve deeper into each point made. Rather than listing examples or outcomes, explain why and how these influences work. For instance, when mentioning the Internet or friends' influence, detail how these factors specifically contribute to development or present challenges.

In conclusion, while the essay shows potential, focusing on a single viewpoint, providing detailed support for arguments, and improving adherence to formal writing conventions will significantly enhance readability and effectiveness. Following the structure and advice provided can lead to better scoring considerations in future essays.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4055,https://essayforum.com/writing/teenagers-prefer-online-socializing-direct-91520/,test,IELTS Task 2 - Why teenagers prefer online socializing to direct communication.,"When compared to direct communication, virtual socializing gains greater popularity among young people. This essay discusses the possible reasons for this popularity and gives a measure to encourage physical communication in the young. \n The first reason lies in the cost-effective and private nature of online interactions. Instead of face-timing, young people can go to a cafe, pay for a drink and have a chat. But using a webcam, teenagers can regularly converse with their friends in the comfort of their home, which is much more economical. Also, online communication allows the young to present themselves in the more private settings of their homes or their bedrooms, which facilitates deeper and more intimate talks. \n Secondly, virtual socializing is a safer and more controlled alternative to direct communication. Since people have more control over who they interact with and how the socializing happens, they are far less likely to encounter unexpected accidents. Furthermore, if the person wishes to be alone, he can just shut the camera off. While he can still connect with other people and show them part of his world, he also has his independence. \n However, focusing only on virtual communication might hinder children's social development. In order to stimulate teenagers' interest in one-on-one interactions, parents should curtail their children's screen time and encourage them to spend more quality time with their families. Not only does this teach teenagers essential social skills but also sets a good model of healthy interactions. Thus, adolescents will learn the importance of physical communication and naturally opt for such interactions. \n Overall, while virtual socializing is favored by teenagers in terms of costs, privateness, and control, parents should make sure their teenage children find a balance between virtual and non-virtual interactions.","<quotation>Instead of face-timing</quotation> \n This discussion point is rather confusing. This phrase in particular, refers to an I Mac or I Phone feature for online video chatting. So it cannot be used as a counter reference for virtual interactions. The very nature of the phrase refers to an online communications platform. \n <quotation>young people can go to a cafe</quotation> \n A cafe is used for physical social interactions. The addition of the word ""internet"" before the word ""cafe"" would have made the online interaction reference more obvious and less confusing. \n Overall, this paragraph creates confusion for the reader due to improper word reference usage. Reference to online interactions need a better description to suit the prompt topic basis. \n <quotation>virtual socializing is a safer and more controlled alternative</quotation> \n This is the more appropriate and far better referenced discussion paragraph. The miter need not have used 2 reasons as to the ""Why"" question as only one reason is required. Had the writer used this reason immediately without a previous reason, the C + C and scores would not have been reduced. \n The prompt restatement was clear but did not have a thesis sentence.so there is no direct response to the provided questions as task required. So the score in terms of production accuracy is also going to be lower as it does not follow the expected summary response format.","The essay effectively addresses the topic, which revolves around the reasons behind the growing popularity of virtual socializing among young people compared to direct communication, and suggests a measure to encourage physical interactions. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved for clarity, accuracy, and overall effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay introduces the subject well and outlines reasons supporting the preference for virtual socializing. However, it lacks a clear thesis statement that directly responds to the essay prompt. It’s important to include a thesis statement early in the essay that clearly states your main argument or viewpoint in response to the essay question. This will provide a clearer direction for your essay and make it easier for readers to understand your position from the beginning.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay is mostly free from spelling and grammar mistakes, which is good. However, there’s a misuse of terms that causes confusion, specifically the use of ""face-timing"" to contrast with virtual socializing. Since ""FaceTime"" refers to a form of online communication, it contradicts the intended contrast with physical interactions. To improve clarity, it's essential to choose words and phrases carefully to accurately convey your meaning without confusion. Additionally, incorporating transitions between paragraphs would enhance the flow of the essay.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay demonstrates a clear point of view, arguing that virtual socializing has various advantages for young people but suggests a balance should be found with physical interactions. This perspective is maintained throughout the essay, which is good. However, reinforcing this viewpoint with a more structured argument, including a defined thesis statement, would strengthen the essay.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The arguments given to support the preference for virtual socializing—cost-effectiveness and safety—are relevant and well-explained. However, the comparison made with going to a café and the incorrect reference to ""face-timing"" as opposed to virtual interactions creates confusion. It’s crucial to ensure that examples and arguments directly support your main point without ambiguity. Moreover, focusing on developing a single, strong reason might have been more effective than presenting multiple reasons with less depth. Additionally, more specific examples or evidence could enhance the persuasiveness of the arguments.

To improve the essay, consider revising with a clear thesis statement, refining the arguments to ensure they directly support the thesis without causing confusion, and using precise language to avoid misinterpretation. Furthermore, encouraging physical interactions among youth could be more compelling with detailed examples or strategies beyond family interactions, possibly including community events or outdoor activities.",4,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4056,https://essayforum.com/writing/government-lower-budget-arts-order-allocate-93266/,test,The government should lower the budget on the arts in order to allocate more money to education.,"It is a common belief that government support for the arts should be cut back to increase funding for education. I completely agree with this view for the following reasons. \n To begin with, money spent on education is barely enough. Most schools in developing and underdeveloped countries are either poorly equipped or equipped with dilapidated facilities. This slows down students' study progress as they cannot approach school subjects properly. Take students in Nigeria as an example, the majority of students there have no access to computers and internet connection. This limits children's opportunities to learn IT, which requires at least a set of computers. \n On top of that, while education is a necessity, art is rather a luxury. Although it is argued that artworks serve to educate people about the culture, history, and heritage of a country and also act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists, their importance is incomparable to that of education. Ensuring the quality of education at all levels is essential to produce professionals who can serve the nation better, playing an important role in the development of a country. However, if art is a nation's top priority, they will only receive temporary benefits from visitors and tourists, which are an unstable source of income. \n To conclude, although education plays a vital role in the progress of a country, funding for education is rather low. For these reasons, I firmly believe that higher amounts of money should be spent on education instead of the arts.","The writer has done a very good job in discussing his supporting opinion points. The reasons provided are sound and well explained to the reader. The examiner will take note of this and apply the correct C+C score to the reasoning sections.However, the C+C will be slightly limited in scoring range because of 2 reasons: \n 1. The prompt restatement was delivered clearly. However, the personal opinion does not offer the summary of supporting reasons. This resulted in only a partly clear opinion presentation. The subjects for the opinion should be indicated as a part of the opinion statement at all times. \n 2. The concluding summary forgot to indicate a reasoning restatement. The restatement would have helped the essay meet the minimum 40 word count for the reverse paraphrase section at the end. \n Not worry though, the essay will still get a passing score, just not as high as it could have been.","The essay provided presents a strong stance on the allocation of government funds, favoring the increase of funding for education over arts support. The argument is grounded on the essential nature of education compared to the perceived luxury status of the arts. The illustrative example involving Nigerian students' limited access to IT resources effectively highlights the consequences of underfunded education systems. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay addresses the topic directly and provides a clear stance in agreement with the proposition that government support for the arts should be reallocated to education. This approach is commendable as it establishes a firm position from the outset.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay is mostly free from grammatical errors, and the style is consistent with the formal tone expected in such essays. However, attentiveness to sentence structure and variety can further refine the essay's readability and engagement.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** The point of view is explicitly stated, which is a strength. However, the introduction could be improved by summarizing the supporting reasons for the stance taken. This would provide a clearer roadmap to the reader about the structure and content of the argument.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The arguments presented are clear and backed by descriptive examples, especially the situation in Nigeria concerning IT education. Enhancing these arguments could involve drawing a more explicit comparison between the tangible benefits of investing in education versus the intangible benefits of the arts, possibly incorporating statistical data or studies for a more persuasive impact.

Improvements can specifically target the articulation of the opinion and the inclusion of a reasoning restatement in the conclusion. Explicitly stating the reasons for the opinion in the introduction could refine the reader's understanding of the essay's direction. Additionally, revisiting the key arguments in the conclusion, in a manner that mirrors the introduction (a technique known as ""reverse paraphrase""), would not only solidify the essay's structure but also ensure it meets length requirements for certain sections.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a coherent argument. Focusing on the detailed feedback provided can elevate the essay's effectiveness, assisting in achieving a higher assessment score.

What are the reasons?,"In recent years, it is true that there have been increasingly particular students have difficulty in staying focused on class. This essay will discuss various significant reasons and give solutions to decrease the problem. \n To begin with, there are a number of elements that make students not pay attention at school. The foremost issue that impacts on students' study is the heavy workload at school and at home. Teachers have a tendency to give them an enormous range of homework that gradually makes them feel tired, stressed and hard to concentrate on lessons. Another reason why students are distracted in class is lack of sleep. A number of students have a habit of staying up late to watch films or play games, and consequently they feel downsy in the next morning. Last but not least, theoretic lessons also can lead to study neglect. For instance, literature teachers require students to write down too much that do not grasp students' attention. \n On the contrary, there are a great deal of solutions to cope with this problem. The first measure is that students should organize a reasonable learning schedule to avoid being exhausted with the help from parents and teachers. This also helps them have more time to take care of themselves and participate in outdoor activities. Furthermore, it is necessary for students to have the opportunity to do experiments so that they do not feel bored when learning. In addition, teachers should change teaching methods. For example, they can add more images, illustrations to the lessons and try to be inspired teachers. These ways may make the class hours not tedious anymore. \n In conclusion, distraction of students can be caused by many reasons. Therefore, parents and school ought to solve the problem immediately","<quotation>it is true</quotation> \n Use a general referenceinstead.

However, there are some areas that could be improved to make your argument stronger and your writing clearer.

Firstly, instead of starting with ""it is true that,"" consider opening with a general observation without asserting its truthfulness. For example, you could begin with ""Many students find it hard to stay focused in class"" to provide a more neutral introduction.

Your introduction could be more effective by directly stating the causes and solutions you plan to discuss. This helps the reader understand your main points right away and demonstrates that you have grasped the essay's requirements.

Be cautious not to repeat the essay prompt unnecessarily. Use your introduction to paraphrase the topic once, and then move straight into your arguments. Repetition does not strengthen your essay and may take up space that could be better used for developing your ideas.

Your discussion of the reasons for students' lack of focus could be improved by creating a clearer connection between them. For instance, the heavy workload leading to lack of sleep could be presented as a chain of causes and effects, thereby enhancing the coherence of your essay.

The phrase ""On the contrary"" is usually used to introduce an opposing viewpoint. In your essay, it seems to introduce solutions rather than oppositions, which may confuse readers. It's better to use a transition that clearly indicates you're moving from discussing problems to discussing solutions.

Additionally, ensure that your solutions directly address the problems you've identified. This connection might seem obvious to you, but explicitly stating how each solution tackles a specific problem can strengthen your argument and make your essay more cohesive.

Your conclusion should summarize the main points discussed in the essay, including both the causes of students' distractions and the suggested solutions. This recap helps reinforce your arguments and provides a clear ending to your essay.

Finally, pay close attention to minor spelling and grammatical errors, as well as sentence structure. Ensuring your writing is clear and correct will make your essay easier to understand and more professional.

Overall, your essay tackles an important issue and shows good insight into possible solutions. By refining your structure, clarifying your arguments, and carefully reviewing your language use, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your essay.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Cause-Effect

In this essay, I will try to discuss both viewpoints before reaching my own opinion. \n On the one hand, there are many reasons why having a life in big cities is such an advantageous way of living and can bring various merits to people. Firstly, living in urban areas tends to provide residents with a number of job opportunities. In this way, the aims in people's lives would likely become more and more plausible to pursue and acquire, which is due to the fact that it will help people ensure their career paths, boost their egos, and take hold of their ways of living among many others. Besides, these days, there are several sorts of job choices that can be suited to people from all walks of life, from blue-collar work to white-collar jobs, which potentially plays a significant role in resolving the unemployment issues. Secondly, there is a wide range of services, which is a result of how society is deeply changing day-to-day due to various advanced developments. It's clearly signified that versatile kinds of services have now arrived in our daily lives. For instance, even one of the most trivial tasks, including booking a taxi or ordering food, can now be easily carried out without any doubt. Furthermore, it is also indisputable that thanks to these services which have helped people reduce the burdens from the hustle and bustle of cities, their lives are thoroughly improved in many aspects. \n On the other hand, living in the era of urbanization can put people into struggling situations with a number of hardships. First and foremost, one of many alarming issues that people in large cities have to deal with is pollution. Broadly speaking, urban areas have seen a significant rise in the number of breeds of pollution. For example, air pollution, noise pollution, and so forth. These significations of urban life would not only slowly and gradually devastate and contaminate the overall environment but also have enormous effects on people's health in an adverse way. Besides, the more sufficiently the services are supplied nowadays, the higher the living costs are in general. It's due to the fact that compared to life in smaller cities, there is a variety of living expenses that make residents' lives are far more disadvantageous to be met demand such as education spending, hospital fees, and so on. Moreover, instead of putting all efforts into settling in large cities, people can try to stay in a self-sufficient way of life in minor cities or suburb areas, which doesn't cost a deal in living and help residents be able to establish a greener and more eco-friendly lifestyle. \n After considering all the facts, I would agree that although living in big cities has some prominent downsides, it still remains essential for people to go in search of life-changing experience and acquire better living conditions in those cities.","<quotation>I will try to discuss both viewpoints before reaching my own opinion.</quotation> \n While you can opt to repeat the writing instructions at the end of the paragraph, that will not get a score because it does not meet the requirements for the scoring elements in that paragraph. Remember, it is called the ""topic restatement + personal opinion presentation"". The other keyword being ""personal opinion"". Therefore, after presenting the 2 public opinion in a rephrased form, the 3rd or last sentence of this paragraph needs to be your clear personal opinion. Why? The task accuracy score for this paragraph is reliant on the correct restatement and the clarity of your personal opinion. Simply repeating the instructions for the discussion does not meet this specific paragraph requirement. \n <quotation>After considering all the facts, I would agree that</quotation> \n The task 2 essay does not allow the writer to present a response to the question in the last paragraph. This is because the last paragraph is used only to summarize the topic and reasoning paragraphs that were previously presented. The personal opinion must be fully developed as a stand alone paragraph, completely explained. The lack of a proper summary conclusion paragraph could very well result in an automatic failing score for the test taker. \n An additional error is the approach to the public opinion presentations. Due to the lack of proper referencing that makes it clear that the public reasons are being considered, those 2 paragraphs come across as a part of the personal opinion of the writer. Creating a comparative discussion of the personal kind where a comparative discussion of the public kind is actually required. The format is: \n Public opinion + explanation + personal opinion in consideration of the public reasons = Agreement / Disagreement \n That discussion format will avoid the need to write 3 individual paragraphs as the writer will be presenting a personal opinion each time. It is a stronger form of personal opinion discussion as a personal opinion for each stance is provided.","The essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages of living in big cities and touches upon how these factors contribute to a person's decision on urban living. Overall, the essay stays relevant to the asked topic, presenting arguments for both sides before concluding with a personal standpoint. However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance clarity, structure, and effectiveness.

1. **Response to Topic and Structure**: The initial statement indicating an intent to ""discuss both viewpoints before reaching my own opinion"" is a good approach but could be clearer. Instead of merely repeating the essay prompt, try to paraphrase the topic and clearly state your personal opinion in the introduction. This will not only make your stance clear from the beginning but also aligns with the essay’s requirement of presenting a personal view. In the conclusion, rather than introducing new opinions, succinctly summarize your arguments and restate your personal opinion to strengthen the essay's message.

2. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**: While the essay is generally well-written, attention to simpler language and sentence structures could enhance comprehension, especially for an audience of English language learners. Complex sentences and intricate vocabulary might obscure the intended points. Simplifying the language without losing the richness of your argument will make your essay more accessible and engaging. 

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view becomes clearer towards the end of the essay. However, integrating your personal opinion more explicitly throughout the essay would provide a more compelling narrative. Distinguish between public opinion and your own views more clearly by structuring the essay around your personal responses to those public opinions. This will fulfill the essay requirement for a clear personal standpoint.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay does well to include examples and reasons in support of both the advantages and disadvantages of urban living. To further strengthen your arguments, ensure a balance in the discussion by giving equal weight to each viewpoint. Refining the connection of these arguments to your personal opinion will also make your position more robust. Instead of merely listing advantages and disadvantages, analyze how they influence your perspective on urban living.

In summary, by refining the clarity and presentation of your personal opinion, simplifying language for clearer communication, and structuring the essay to include a balanced discussion that directly supports your viewpoint, you can significantly improve the coherence and persuasiveness of your essay.",4,4,3,4,3,3,1,4,4,1,Argumentative
4059,https://essayforum.com/writing/education-necesssary-fight-overpopulation-main-94718/,test,Education is necesssary in the fight against overpopulation. What main reasons?,"These days, overpopulation is growing rapidly, which can trigger a great number of issues for the degradation of natural resources and environments. An international charity assumed that edification for all children plays a vital role in resisting this issue. I comprehensively agree with this thought that considers the principal cause, especially included sexual abuse and cultural conception. In this essay, an attempt will be made to examine these points. \n Sexual abuse is one of the most elements that caused the growth of the population in the world. And women and girls encounter sexual violence at high rates. According to a report, one out of every six American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime, 82% of all victims are juveniles, and 90% of rape victims are adults. Because of teenagers' limited cognition of various forms of sexual abuse, their curiosity to explore gender, and their lack of skills to prevent and report abusers are causes that trigger them to be prey. And this unavailability of understanding correlated to sex education. \n Another prime causality of overpopulation is conception. Eastern people believed that having numerous children would bring them a fortune. And those who come from large families tend to have less level of education, because the more people in the family, the poorer they are, leading to unaffordable for their children's schooling. The rapid population increase is also for this reason. \n In conclusion, overpopulation has fundamental demerit impacts on both individuals and society. Consequently, edification plays an essential function in tackling population increase. Therefore, we should spread it widely to all inhabitants and especially children who can make a decline in overpopulation.","Okay, the main problem here is the constant use of the term ""edification"" to refer to ""education"". You have been confused by the meaning of the words. Edification refers to the act of edifying. In turn, edifying is defined as; to instruct or benefit, especially morally or spiritually; uplift. This is different from education which directly means: the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life. \n As such, your essay can fail based on incorrect reference usage alone. You are not truly focused on the discussion of education, as it is used in the discussion. You have confused yourself in the process of trying to use advanced English words, whose meaning you are not clear about, nor how to use it.","The essay tackles an important and complex issue: how education can play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of overpopulation. The effort to link education, specifically in the areas of sexual abuse awareness and cultural conceptions of family size, to population growth, demonstrates an insightful approach to the topic. However, for the essay to effectively communicate its message and improve its impact, several areas need attention and refinement.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay responds to the topic by arguing that education is key to addressing overpopulation issues. This position is clear and directly addresses the subject matter. However, the essay would benefit from a more precise definition of education. The term ""edification"" has been used interchangeably with education, which does not accurately convey the intended meaning. ""Education"" refers to the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university, which is the context implied in the essay. Clearing up this confusion by consistently using the correct term will strengthen the argument and ensure clarity for the reader.

2. **Language and Style:**
There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that hinder its readability and effectiveness. Simplifying the language can make the arguments more accessible, especially for an audience that may include English language learners. Avoiding the overuse of complex vocabulary where simpler words would suffice can also enhance clarity. For example, using ""education"" instead of ""edification"" not only corrects the misuse but also simplifies the language for better understanding.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
The essay presents a clear point of view, agreeing with the notion that education plays a vital role in mitigating the effects of overpopulation. This stance is consistently maintained throughout the essay, which is commendable. To further strengthen this aspect, ensure that each paragraph directly supports this central thesis with clear and concise arguments.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
The essay identifies sexual abuse and cultural conceptions as factors contributing to overpopulation and asserts that education can address these issues. While these points are relevant, the essay would benefit from more detailed explanations and the use of specific examples or data to support these claims. For instance, elaborating on how education can change cultural conceptions of family size or reduce instances of sexual abuse would provide a stronger argumentative foundation.

In conclusion, focusing on the precise use of language, particularly the correct terminology for education, will significantly enhance the essay's clarity and effectiveness. Simplifying the language, providing more explicit support for claims, and ensuring the essay's structure clearly presents and supports the author's point of view are essential steps for improvement. With these adjustments, the essay has the potential to compellingly argue the importance of education in addressing overpopulation challenges.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4060,https://essayforum.com/writing/robots-become-smarter-humans-take-control-76821/,test,Robots will become smarter than humans and will take control of their society,"It is true that in this technological era, innovative machines like robots are gradually replacing humans in many roles. From my point of view, I firmly agree with the idea that robots will have a growing impact on the society and eventually take over the world. \n Robots will be increasingly important to everyday lives, doing menial tasks, but they will render humans redundant. There is serious risk of dangerous behavior on part of artificial intelligent since it is likely to produce drastic changes in thought. For example, robots will be under the controls it was given, but these may not be the controls that were meant and they may change it to deadly intention. Although it is reasonable to claim that super intelligent computers could do things that ordinary person can not, for instance, finding cures for cancer and other illnesses, it is not so certain that these intelligent machines can create safe for mankind. In long term, it could have potential of disasters in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming \n There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to provide safeguards on intelligent machines and to shut down the whole system if it is considered to be a threat. A second measure would be for governments to raise people awareness about the issues and the tremendous consequence that artificial intelligent can bring. Finally, restriction and regulation on robots should be made to assure the safety of humans. For example, scientists can train robots to be good role models and teach them about exemplary behavior. \n In conclusion, robots will become smarter one day so at the same time, researchers should investigate the ways of preventing the negative effects of artificial intelligent for the shake of a better world.","Dear student, in my opinion, I believe that your essay will score between a 4-5 at best. Your essay has a number of problem points that need to be addressed so that you will not make the same mistake in your future practice test. The first problem with your essay is that you did not accurately use the first paragraph to represent your English comprehension skills via the proper paraphrasing of the prompt discussion topic and discussion instructions. You instead, launched into a direct discussion of the topic. The first paragraph is written with the assumption that the examiner does not have access to the original prompt requirement and therefore, needs an accurate retelling of the topic and instructions coming from you. That was not the case in this instance. Additionally, you said ""I firmly agree"" when the instruction was to use the phrase ""I agree to a certain extent"" since that is the discussion instruction being provided (To what extent do you agree of disagree). \n In your second paragraph, you used the term ""but"" to describe how the robots will make the humans redundant. The correct term to use would have been the connecting word ""and"" since you already presented previous ideas that tie together in the sentence. The whole paragraph is prone to misused English words which creates a distorted message for the reader. This results in confusion on the examiners part and points will be deducted from your LR and GRA scores in the final consideration. \n The next paragraph discusses what the government should do to prevent the problem. This is a mistake because the original instruction dictates that you refer to ""society"" in the discussion of solutions. Not the government. Be aware of the keywords in every prompt discussion your are provided if you change one keyword, as you did here, you totally change the slant of the discussion and will be scored down in terms of TA considerations. \n The TA is where you prove your English comprehension skills. By using the wrong terms in the essay, you show a shallow understanding of the English language and an inability to understand the meaning or the difference between the terms being used in the original prompt. This is highly evident in the last line of your concluding paragraph where you use the term ""Shake"" (to tremble or vibrate) instead of the proper ""sake"" (for the purpose of; in the interest of; in order to achieve or preserve.) \n By the way, academic writing rules dictate the use of 3-5 sentences per paragraph in these English tests for a very basic reason. You are supposed to show off your English writing skills via the presentation of simple to complex English sentences. Therefore, you need to write more in order to do that. \n Simply trying to summarize all of the necessary information in a single sentence proves only one thing, you know how to write run-on sentences, which you will also lose points for in the C&C section of the essay. The C&C criteria is clear on its scoring consideration, you need to present complete paragraphs in each of the paragraphs. You failed to form complete paragraphs in parts of the essay. Specifically in the opening statement and the concluding statement. A paragraph is considered complete when it has an average of 3 and a maximum of 5 sentences in it. Your concluding statement needs to only represent the following in individual sentences: \n 1. Another paraphrase of the topic for discussion; \n 2. A summary of the discussion points presented; \n 3. A repetition of your opinion as the closing sentence. \n Avoid run on sentences at all costs because it will result in lower scores in the individual considerations and then again, in the overall consideration of the final scoring.","The essay provides an intriguing viewpoint on the potential impact of robots and artificial intelligence on society, presenting some well-considered arguments. However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to better meet the requirements of English proficiency tests and to provide a clearer, more effective argument.

1. Introduction: The opening paragraph jumps directly into arguing the position without properly setting up the context or paraphrasing the essay prompt. It's important to start with a clear restatement of the topic and instructions. This helps the reader understand the essay's direction without having seen the original prompt.

2. Clarity and Cohesion: The essay occasionally suffers from issues with word choice and sentence structure, impacting clarity. For example, the use of ""but"" instead of ""and"" in discussing how robots could make humans redundant alters the intended meaning. Be attentive to word choice to ensure the progression of ideas is logical and clear.

3. Task Response: The essay deviates from the prompt requirements by focusing on what the government, rather than society, can do to address the concerns raised. It's crucial to stick closely to the prompt and use the correct terms specified, as changing key terms can shift the focus of the discussion, affecting how your response is evaluated.

4. Academic Writing Style: More attention is needed to adhere to academic writing conventions, which include using a minimum of 3-5 sentences per paragraph to fully develop ideas. This essay includes paragraphs that are too brief, limiting the opportunity to showcase a range of sentence structures and depth of argument.

5. Conclusion: The concluding paragraph should succinctly paraphrase the discussion topic, summarize the main points made, and reaffirm your stance in a clear manner. Avoid common mistakes such as using incorrect words, e.g., ""shake"" instead of ""sake,"" which can detract from the professionalism of the writing.

6. Grammar and Spelling: Watch out for grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Incorrect word choice can confuse readers and detract from the overall persuasiveness of your argument.

In summary, while there are strengths in the arguments made, focusing on the structure of the essay, ensuring adherence to the prompt, and polishing grammar and word choice can significantly improve the effectiveness and coherence of your writing. Remember, the key to a successful essay is not just in presenting compelling arguments but also in how clearly and professionally those arguments are communicated.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

I can't wait for my teacher to start the lesson, but I had to get my books first. I was very excited to learn grade four because I would meet new friends, and start a new grade. First, I looked at all the books with my mom, and sister. Finally, I turned on my computer, and looked at all my lessons. It looked fun! \n I started with Bible, the teacher taught me all about Heaven, what was and wasn't in it, and how we can get there. Then, I learned math, it was amusing, especially doing the work in the book. After math was language, the work was very interesting, and not hard at all. Then, I started reading, I had to go to my aunt's house to borrow my cousin's books to learn because I didn't have all of them. Then, my aunt couldn't find a book, and I had to find it at my house, which took twenty minutes, but I couldn't find anything. I reported the news to my aunt, she looked at her house, and finally found it in her closet, what a waste of time! I returned home to read with my teacher, Miss Gutterizz, my mom liked her best because she was energetic, and she talked fast. I don't agree, I like all of my teachers the same. I turned on history to study. My teacher started out by reading The American's Creed, it was interesting listening to it for the first time ever. After history was science, I learned how to observe insects, I had to look at the page even though the insects were very creepy. \n That was the end of my fun day. I had a lot of fun learning on the first day. I know that I would enjoy learning it.","The essay is a bit confusing to read. Are you being home schooled? Or does your school practice the hybrid classroom set up? You did not clearly set up your learning / classroom background before launching into the experience discussion. You might want to set that up better for your reader when you edit the paper. For clarity sake. Too much time was spent on the book search, that should not take up so many sentences. It should be limited in presentation since it is not really relevant to the learning discussion. Yes, you were looking for a schoolbook, but you did not need to be so detailed about the search. It tended to take over the whole presentation rather than just being a mention in the essay.","The essay shares a narrative of the first day in a new grade, detailing the anticipation, the subjects learned, and interactions with teachers and family. While the excitement for learning and the classroom (or perhaps, home classroom) environment shines through, there are areas for improvement to make the essay even more engaging and clear. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay captures a day of learning, but it’s important to clarify the setting at the beginning. Are the lessons happening at home or in a traditional school? This detail will help readers understand the context of your experiences more clearly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** The essay is well-written but could benefit from a more varied sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. Pay attention to the consistency of tenses. For example, consider changing “I was very excited to learn grade four because I would meet new friends, and start a new grade” to “I was very excited to learn in grade four because I was going to meet new friends and start a new grade.” This helps in maintaining the narrative's past tense uniformly.

3. **Point of View:** Your point of view as a fourth-grader excited about new learning experiences is clear. Maintaining this perspective consistently will strengthen your narrative. Remember to consistently use past tense to keep your story uniform.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You provide a detailed account of your day, but focusing more on your feelings about each subject and why they matter to you would enrich your essay. Instead of spending a lot of detail on the search for a book, which doesn't directly relate to your learning experience, consider offering more insight into what made each lesson special. For instance, what specifically about math amused you? This approach keeps the focus on the learning experience itself.

Additionally, consider briefly summarizing what you learned in each subject at the day's end to offer a sense of accomplishment and reflection on your first day in the fourth grade. 

Lastly, remember that every detail in your essay should serve the purpose of highlighting your learning experience. Limiting less relevant details, like the extended search for a book, will help keep the reader's attention on the main narrative. Focusing on these areas will make your essay clearer, more engaging, and more informative about your unique learning journey.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,Narrative

This essay will highlight both the positives and negatives that result from this approach. \n On the one hand, there are two possible advantages that owning a home would bring about. The first is the sense of comfort when being a house owner. It plays an important role in urban life. This is because people renting a home would concern about many problems related to monthly utility fees, house modification, and their landlord. They might have difficulty coping with financial burdens and having a good relationship with their house's owner. Another significant positive which should be highlighted is that people do not know what life holds in store for them in the future, hence owning a home in a long term appears safer than renting accommodation on a temporary basis. In fact, it has been proven that they can have settlement to concentrate on work or family. \n Nevertheless, there are some obvious disadvantages that would arise. The most obvious is the costs for home maintenance and repairs can impact savings quickly. This is because people tend to set a budget for unexpected home repairs which helps to ensure that they have enough money to keep their home safe and in good working order. Besides the home maintenance and repairs, homeowners may face many risks like certain disaster areas where tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods are common. In deed, it is definitely unpredictable, but purchasing or building a house a few hundred feet from ocean might easily lead to catastrophic consequences with no one to blame except their temptation to own waterfront property within incredible ocean view. \n In conclusion, there are plus point to be a homeowner regarding to the sense of comfort and safety.

While you aimed to present a balanced view on this topic, there are several important areas for improvement to enhance the quality and effectiveness of your essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your introduction suggests that the essay will discuss a ""common trend"" towards homeownership in comparison to renting. This implies a shift in behavior over time. However, the original task does not specify a trend or change, only a preference for one over the other. It's crucial to directly address the prompt without introducing unmentioned elements. Furthermore, the assignment requests a clear stance on the topic, but your essay attempts to discuss both sides equally. For a more effective response, focus on articulating and defending one viewpoint throughout your essay.

2. **Clear Point of View**: The essay doesn't adequately establish a clear personal stance on the issue. Instead of comparing pros and cons, try to state your opinion clearly and build the essay around supporting that viewpoint. This approach will help meet the essay’s requirement for offering a reasoned argument in favor of a particular opinion.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some minor errors and awkward phrases that hinder the flow of your writing. For example, ""In deed"" should be ""Indeed,"" and phrases like ""there are plus point to be a homeowner"" could be revised for clarity (""there are benefits to being a homeowner""). Paying attention to grammar and style will make your essay easier to read and more professional.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You’ve outlined potential benefits and downsides of homeownership, but the arguments could be more persuasive with specific examples or data to back them up. For instance, when discussing the financial strain of maintenance costs, mentioning a relevant statistic or study could strengthen your argument. Also, ensure your arguments directly support your viewpoint rather than appearing as a neutral comparison.

As you refine your essay, concentrate on presenting a coherent argument that aligns with the essay prompt. Clearly state your opinion and use focused, well-supported points to argue in favor of that perspective. Improving the clarity of your stance and addressing the topic directly, without introducing unrelated elements, will significantly enhance your essay.

Some people would suggest that brought up in poor condition family is better for children; however, I personally believe that children who brought up in rich family will be better for children. \n First, with reference to get offered a job in the future, the reason why I disagree with the topic is that children who grown up in wealthy family are usually have higher education level. And that can make them find a job easier. Simply speaking, their family can support them to go to study in University, moreover, they might have enough money and ability let their children study abroad, on the other hands, they would have an amazing personal statement on their resume and have more possibility to get hired. Despite the majority may stick to the idea that it is all about the personal ability, this is a common sight that always happen in this society. \n Second, money is always the problem that people have to face when they grow up. For example, if their parents have enough money to invest children to create their own career, they don't need to borrow money from bank. Obviously, they don't need to carry a large number of debts and high risk for creating their business. As an illustration, they will have more time to think how to run their business; however, the children who own this advantage should be brought up by wealthy parents. \n To sum up, I once again reaffirm my position that compare with wealthy family, the family who don't have that much money their children are not better prepared to deal with the problem of adult life. Surely, some children who grown up in wealthy family are also not prepared for the adult problem in the future, but the undeniable thing is they have more possibility to solve those problems","You have not done a very good job on this essay.

The topic is clear, however, the way it's addressed could be significantly improved to meet the essay's requirements effectively.

Firstly, the essay prompt asks to what extent you agree or disagree with the statement provided. Your essay should start by clearly stating your position on this scale of agreement or disagreement, followed directly by reasons supporting this stance. Your essay jumps into reasons without clearly framing your argument in terms of the extent of your agreement or disagreement, which is a crucial step in responding accurately to the prompt.

Your essay exceeds the preferred word count, containing 344 words against the recommended range of 275-290 words. While your enthusiasm for the subject is evident, a more concise essay would be more effective. Aim to express your ideas clearly and concisely, focusing on quality rather than quantity. This approach will reduce the chance of introducing errors and improve the clarity of your argument.

The essay also suffers from several stylistic issues that affect its readability and coherence. It's important to avoid starting sentences with conjunctions like ""and,"" as this can disrupt the flow and structure of your writing. Additionally, watch for overuse of filler phrases that do not add value to your argument. Each sentence should contribute directly to advancing your position or explaining your reasoning.

In terms of grammar and punctuation, attention to detail is crucial. Misplaced capitalization, incorrect use of semi-colons, and misused punctuation marks detract from the professionalism of your writing. Ensuring correct grammar and punctuation use will help your essay's clarity and readability.

To enhance the strength of your essay, ensure that each argument is clearly linked to your main point of view. Avoid general statements by providing specific, descriptive reasons that directly support your stance. Utilizing concrete examples can also strengthen your argument and make it more compelling.

While the income of some people still unchanged and people in poor those who even do not possess any land to self-cultivate. As a result, if the food does not be provided in concessional rate, they would not access it. Another reason is due to climate change in recent decades. Drought, tsunami, earthquake and many other natural disasters have taken away asset of many residents worldwide. Some areas of Africa, for example, have not rained in many years. Consequently, people living in these regions cannot grow their crops. They depend on food that was grown in other areas and if that is not available, then these people will have to go hungry. \n However, there are several actions that could be taken to mitigate the problem mentioned above. \n Firstly, The government need to ensure that food is always available for needy people or at a reasonable price. For instance, in developing countries, people in need can receive free products like meat, rice, the bread which already reached expiry date but can still be used at local supermarkets.

Secondly, It is better for wealthy nations which grow surplus food to show the generous to share their excess with poor countries that do not have enough food for citizens. International organizations have to play an important role in ensuring that nations share their rich and resources with those that need it. \n In conclusion, although it is obvious that productivity in agriculture has improved owing to technology advance, numerous people are still deprived of the food necessity.

The more correct prompt paraphrase is as follows: \n <em>Modernization of farming methods has led to the production of more food. Despite this, hunger is still a global problem. This is a problem that has been caused by the rising cost of food, even as the ease of production was supposed to lower the price of basic commodities. One way of solving this problem is by having the government control the market price of the basic food products.

However, there are several areas in which your essay could be significantly improved to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test.

Firstly, the response to the essay topic needs to be more direct and conclusive. Your introduction should clearly address the questions or statements presented in the prompt, offering a concise summary of the reasons behind the problem and suggesting possible solutions right from the start. A more effective approach could include a direct statement about how, despite technological advancements in agriculture, food affordability and distribution remain significant challenges, and briefly mention the role of government intervention and international cooperation as potential solutions.

Secondly, the organization and length of your essay need attention. The text appears to exceed the typical word limit expected in such exams, which is usually between 250-300 words. Sticking to this limit not only ensures you meet the exam criteria but also helps with clarity and conciseness. Before submitting your work, using a timer while writing can help manage your time more effectively, ensuring you allocate enough time to revise and edit your essay. This practice will improve the overall quality of your submission.

Your essay demonstrates a good effort in discussing causes like inflation, income disparity, and climate change, as well as suggesting solutions like government and international intervention. However, it's vital to present these arguments more systematically, ensuring each point is clearly stated and supported with examples or further explanation.

Regarding language use, there are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that undermine the clarity and professionalism of your essay. For instance, watch out for run-on sentences, subject-verb agreement, and the proper use of articles (""the,"" ""a,"" ""an""). Simplifying sentence structures can help avoid these errors and make your writing more accessible.

To strengthen your position, ensure every paragraph projects a clear point of view, supported by concise, compelling arguments. Every claim you make should directly tie back to how it supports your overall stance on the issue.

In sum, focus on creating a more structured, concise essay that directly addresses the prompt. Practice summarizing your arguments effectively within the word limit, and allocate time for revision to polish your grammar and style. By refining these areas, your writing will become more compelling and aligned with the expectations of an English proficiency test.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4065,https://essayforum.com/writing/school-aged-kids-compelled-partake-local-93331/,test,Should school-aged kids be compelled to partake in local volunteer projects without payment or not?,"There has long been a controversial debate over whether school-aged children should be compelled to partake in local volunteer projects without payment. While acknowledging several notable benefits, I still firmly believe that it should be a matter of personal choice. \n On the one hand, there are two primary reasons why unpaid community services should be a compulsory subject. The key rationale is that doing volunteer allows students to further enhance their interpersonal skills including teamwork, communication or problem-solving abilities which would doubtless be of great necessity during the latter course of their lives. Added to this is invaluable life lessons drawn from practical experience which might cultivate a sense of maturity and responsibility amongst children. As this mandatory subject enables students to approach the disadvantaged and vulnerable in the society as well as get insight into their harsh living conditions, students are likely to develop a multi-dimensional outlook on lives and conduct themselves in a more mature and appropriate manner. \n Considering the concrete gains of unpaid community services, My belief is that it should be a matter of personal preference. The first and foremost argument is that children deserve to be emancipated from any duty in the aftermath of school hours and get rejuvenated via their favorite recreational activities. The idea behind it is that the academic study coupled with various assessment and continuous exams places an enormous strain on school-aged students. Therefore, there should be no additional mandatory subject that cuts down the amount of leisure time meant for their mental and physical well-being. Another convincing argument is that students should be given freedom to do unpaid community-based work otherwise this compulsory subject might sow a seed of resentment and anger in the fragile minds of children, which in turn brings about counter-productive impacts on them. \n In short, a considerable improvement on necessary social skills and life lessons could be the desired impacts of unpaid community services, however, I still hold a firm belief that children are entitled to the right to do volunteer at their own disposal.","There are 3 major problems with the restated prompt. The first problem, is that it alters the public opinion idea by using the wrong reference point: \n <quotation>long been a controversial debate</quotation> \n . There is neither a reference to a controversy, debate, or long term discussion. The topic basis alteration can only result in deductions. \n The second problem, is that the reference to \n <quotation>school-aged children</quotation> \n is made in the discussion. This is an incorrect age range reference as the mention in the original relates to teenagers or young adults. School-age children will never be asked to perform community service. \n Finally, the writer jumped directly opinion basis in the last part. Totally skipping the complete keyword response to the question provided. He should have firmly disagreed before laying out the reason why. \n The first reasoning paragraph is totally unrelated to his opinion as previously stated. This paragraph should not have been presented since this is a single opinion essay. The writer presented 2 valid supporting opinions in the next paragraph which should have been properly expanded over 2 paragraphs instead. Instead, he will lose points for 2 reasons: \n 1. The writer gave an unrelated opinion discussion \n 2. The writer has an under explained related opinion in the essay \n While the sentence structure and word usage will have limited deductions applied, the main scoring areas will receive score reducing deductions.","This essay tackles the question of whether it is appropriate for young individuals, especially those of school age, to be required to engage in unpaid community service. The response is well-structured, presenting both sides of the argument before concluding with a personal stance. However, there are several areas that could be improved for clarity, coherence, and alignment with the essay prompt.

1. **Alignment With Topic Prompt:** The introduction suggests a broad debate about compulsory volunteer work for school-aged children. However, it's essential to accurately reflect the essay topic. The mention of a ""long been a controversial debate"" deviates from presenting a clear, direct response to a given prompt. It's more effective to straightforwardly address the question without implying a historical disagreement unless explicitly mentioned in the prompt. Additionally, ensuring that the age group discussed matches the prompt's intention is crucial; if the question specifies teenagers or young adults, focusing on school-aged children might not be entirely relevant.

2. **Structure and Cohesion:** Though the essay attempts to present a balanced view by exploring both sides of the argument, it's important to remember that if the task is to express and support a personal opinion, the essay should consistently reflect this from beginning to end. After stating the personal position, the following paragraphs should directly support this viewpoint rather than exploring opposing arguments. Structuring the essay to expand on your reasons, rather than discussing contradictory points, would strengthen your position and make your argument more coherent.

3. **Development of Arguments:** The arguments presented in favor of personal choice over compulsory participation in community service are compelling but require deeper exploration. To enhance your essay, consider dividing your main points into separate paragraphs, dedicating more space to each argument. This allows for more detailed explanations and examples, which will enrich your essay and make your stance more persuasive.

4. **Grammar and Style:** While your essay shows a good command of language, paying attention to minor grammatical errors and stylistic choices could improve readability. Avoiding complex sentence structures when a simpler one will suffice can help ensure clarity. Also, maintaining consistency in the tone and style throughout the essay will aid in delivering a more polished piece.

5. **Conclusion:** Your concluding paragraph does a good job of summarizing your viewpoint. For further improvement, reassert your main arguments here briefly, reinforcing why you believe personal choice should prevail in the matter of voluntary community service. This will leave readers with a clear understanding of your position.

Remember, every piece of writing is a chance to express your ideas more clearly and powerfully. Taking these suggestions into account will not only align your future essays more closely with given prompts but also enhance the persuasiveness and coherence of your arguments.",4,4,4,3,2,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

You've highlighted the devastating effects of human activity on forests and proposed individual and governmental actions to mitigate this problem. Let's delve into how we can refine your essay to enhance clarity, coherence, and responsiveness to the prompt.

1. **Adherence to the Topic**: The central question asks for solutions to deforestation. While you've mentioned the significance of forests and the repercussions of deforestation, the bulk of your essay dwells on the problem rather than focusing on detailed solutions. It's crucial to direct your argument towards specific, actionable solutions to the issue at hand. Consider revising your essay to include a clearer thesis statement that outlines your proposed solutions, then devote one paragraph to each solution, ensuring they are directly related to tackling deforestation.

2. **Word Count**: Your essay currently falls below the minimum word count requirement, which is crucial for meeting the test criteria. Expanding your essay to at least 250 words is necessary to avoid penalties. An effective way to increase your word count is by elaborating on the solutions you propose. Describe how each solution could be implemented, its potential impact, and address possible challenges in implementing these solutions.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Pay attention to spelling and grammar. The term ""sove"" should be corrected to ""solve"". Phrases such as ""Falling a swath of trees"" might be better expressed as ""The widespread felling of trees"". Additionally, ensure consistency in verb tenses and maintain a formal tone throughout your essay. Avoid colloquial expressions and ensure your sentences are complete and well-structured.

4. **Clarity and Descriptiveness**: Your points about the importance of forests and the consequences of their destruction are valuable. However, improving the clarity and descriptiveness of your arguments will strengthen your position. For instance, when discussing solutions, be more descriptive about how digital reading can reduce paper consumption and specifically how laws might curb illegal logging. Providing examples or citing studies could make your arguments more compelling.

5. **Point of View**: Your personal standpoint on the issue is clear, especially with the statement, ""From my perspective, I strongly believe..."" This is good practice as it shows engagement with the topic. To enhance this, ensure every part of your essay contributes to supporting this view, particularly focusing on the solutions section, which needs further development.

In summary, your essay has a solid foundation with a crucial environmental concern at its heart. To improve it, concentrate on expanding your discussion with focused, solution-oriented paragraphs, adhering to the word count, and refining your grammar and style for clarity and impact. By doing so, you’ll better meet the requirements of the assignment and more effectively communicate your valuable insights on deforestation.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

However, others believe that free information should be available to certain extent. Both opinions give out the advantages but I personally agree with the latter one. \n There are several explanations for the benefit of free materials. Firstly, if the basic academic knowledge was not spread out over the world and passed down to younger generations, many meaningful inventions were not come up with. For example, theories related to friction are known as fundamental application in building transportation. Secondly, the freedom of information helps people address the problems more quickly. When people encounter an issue, searching for solution online would enable them to take advice and lessons only if the knowledge about previous similar case was shared publicly. \n However, it is true that not all the information in terms of science, business and academic world should be freely available.

The topic is relevant, and the essay addresses it directly. Here's how it can be improved for better clarity and effectiveness:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay begins by stating both points of view on the issue of free information. However, it lacks a distinct paragraph where your personal opinion is developed and compared directly with the other viewpoints. It's essential to explicitly state and explain your personal stance on the issue, incorporating reasoning that distinguishes it from the general arguments presented. This approach will make your essay more coherent and reflective of your critical thinking.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:
   - Watch for spelling errors and typos to maintain professionalism throughout your essay.
   - There are a few grammatical errors that disrupt the flow of your writing. For example, consider revising phrases like ""many meaningful inventions were not come up with"" to ""many meaningful inventions would not have been created.""
   - Your essay could benefit from varied sentence structures to enhance readability and engagement.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: While you briefly mention your agreement with one of the opinions, there's a lack of a first-person narrative to strongly position your personal perspective within the essay. Using first-person pronouns (I, my, mine) is crucial to distinguishing your personal opinion from the general discussion. A specific paragraph dedicated to elaborating on your viewpoint, using first-person narrative, would significantly improve the clarity of your stance.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
   - Your arguments are generally clear but lack depth in places. Providing more detailed examples or explanations would strengthen your position. For instance, when mentioning the dangers of freely available information on weapons, further elaboration or evidence could make this argument more compelling.
   - It's important to justify your personal belief with specific reasons and examples. Merely stating which opinion you agree with doesn't convey the full rationale behind your choice. Explore why you align with that viewpoint and how it compares to the opposing perspective.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion aptly summarizes the essay's main points but could be enhanced by more directly referencing how your personal opinion intertwines with the broader implications of the argument.

However, they are now confronted with many daily problems. This essay will discuss two of these problems which justifies why I believe that governments should motivate people to turn to live in suburban areas. \n Everyday, people living in big cities constantly have to deal with high living costs and low air quality. The former problem may be the consequence of the nonstop advance of living condition in the city. Therefore, to gain a better life, people have to earn a living to cover their basic expenses such as housing, food, healthcare and utility bills which are often much higher than in other regions. Some people may not be able to earn enough money to make ends meet and have to live in narrow, uncomfortable spaces and suffer from poor life. The latter one is partly due to the greater volume of industrial fumes and exhaustion from vehicles, especially during rush hours. This is the reason why people in big cities like Beijing are more likely to suffer from a variety of respiratory problems related to air contamination. \n In my opinion, city residents should be encouraged to move to regional areas. Firstly, costs of living in these regions are much cheaper so that they can afford to pay for a more comfortable life. This as well relieves the pressure on housing supply in cities where many people are forced to live in very narrow accommodation. Moreover, if people move away from metropolises, the population density in these cities will be decreased, which leads to lower volumes of vehicles, critically reducing the levels of air pollution. \n To conclude, I can firmly say that high living expenses and air contamination are among the most prevalent problems facing city residents these days. To gradually solve these problems, I believe that governments should motivate people to move to suburban and satellite cities.","You only needed the last 2 sentences for your thesis statement.

However, there are several ways to refine and improve your writing to make your argument more persuasive and clear to your reader.

1. **Response to Topic and Thesis Clarity**: Your thesis statement, which is supposed to guide the whole essay, can be more focused. The introduction includes sentences that don’t directly address the prompt or contribute to your main argument. Focus on presenting your main idea succinctly right from the start. This will help the reader understand your position without extraneous information. Aim to make your thesis statement the heart of your introduction, and ensure every part of it directly supports or sets up your argument.

2. **Paragraph Structure and Clarity**: The body of your essay should directly support your thesis with clear and distinct arguments. In your second paragraph, the ideas presented feel somewhat repetitive and lack progression. Remember, each sentence in a paragraph should offer new information or further elaborate on the paragraph's main idea. Aim for a structure where each paragraph discusses a single main idea, supported by specific examples or reasoning, within a target of 5 meaningful sentences.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: You've managed to keep spelling and grammar issues to a minimum, which is good. However, paying attention to sentence structure and ensuring variety can help enhance readability and engagement. Short and clear sentences can often make a stronger impact than longer, more complex ones that are harder to follow.

4. **Support and Descriptiveness**: Your arguments on the benefits of moving to suburban areas are good; however, including more specific examples and evidence could strengthen these points. For instance, you could cite studies or statistics that show the improvement in quality of life for those who move from urban to suburban areas. Detailed examples add credibility and depth to your argument.

5. **Conclusion and Persuasiveness**: Your conclusion does a good job of summarizing the essay's main points, but it could also reiterate the significance of addressing these urban challenges. Emphasizing the broader implications of your argument can leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Focus on reinforcing your thesis with clear, concise statements, structuring your paragraphs for maximum impact, and providing specific, detailed support for your arguments.

While many believe that the gradual disappearance of certain natural species is the most urgent threat, others argue that there are a lot more pressing environmental issues. This essay will discuss both views and explain the idea that global warming is of greater concern than any other matter. \n On the one hand, the diminishing availability of natural species is warranting our attention. Our ecosystem, which has taken millions of years to perfect and evolve, has been being destroyed and obliterated by a profusion of human activities such as illegal poaching, squatting and deforestation. For example, many companies are trying to cut down trees in forest areas in order to construct resorts, hotels and factories as a part of expanding their businesses. Consequently, not only do many types of animals are on the brink of extinction attributed to the loss of their natural habitats but many valuable species of plants have also been vanishing without any trace. \n On the other hand, it is global warming that is constantly putting human existence at risk. This kind of problem is believed to be the culprit behind the worsening of our climate. For instance, 2022 has recorded UK's highest temperature at more than 40 celsius degree in July, marking the first time this country has ever experienced such an intense heatwave since the early 2000s. Furthermore, the warmer pattern of the Earth also results in many more extreme natural disasters such as drought, ice caps melting, flood, and severe wildfires, causing more people worldwide to suffer from poverty, and diseases as well as running a higher risk of losing their lives. \n To recapitulate, while I do believe that the disappearance of certain natural species is one of the most trivial matters that should be addressed properly, it seems to me that we had better make an attempt to resolve global warming, which is a more threatening matter to our existence on Earth.","There is no discussion reference in the ougeval in relation to \n <quotation>Conversations have been sparked constantly</quotation> \n It is better for the writer's score if he does not exaggerate any statements that could alter the original focus.

It is unacceptable to refer to this in the conclusion and will result in a failing score for that paragraph.","Your essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the environmental issues of natural species disappearance and global warming, aiming to evaluate which of the two is of greater concern. Here's how your essay could be further improved:

1. **Direct Response to the Topic:**
Your essay addresses the topic by examining two significant environmental issues. However, the introduction could be more direct. Instead of stating ""Conversations have been sparked constantly,"" specify the topic right away. For instance, “This essay evaluates the relative severity of global warming and species extinction.” This approach helps focus your essay without generalizing statements that might divert from your main point.

2. **Clarity and Structure:**
You have successfully outlined the two viewpoints regarding environmental threats. But, it's crucial to explicitly state your opinion earlier in the essay, rather than saving it for the conclusion. Consider adding a third paragraph dedicated to your perspective, clearly supported by reasons and examples. This structure not only strengthens your argument but also makes your standpoint evident, which is a key requirement.

3. **Language and Style:**
- Spelling and grammar are mostly accurate, but watch for minor slips. For example, in “...not only do many types of animals are on the brink of extinction…” the correct form would be “not only are many types of animals on the brink of extinction…”
- Avoid using first-person plural (we, our) when discussing general viewpoints. Instead, employ second-person (you, your) for general advice or discussions, reserving first-person singular (I, my) for expressing personal opinions.
- Ensure to maintain a formal tone throughout your essay. Avoid colloquial expressions and ensure your arguments are presented in a precise and academic manner.

4. **Support and Argumentation:**
Your essay benefits from relevant examples, such as the record temperatures in the UK. Enhance this aspect by elaborating on these examples or adding more to solidify your arguments. Each claim you make should be backed by specific evidence or reasoning to convince your readers of your viewpoint.

Remember, your aim is to directly address the essay prompt, present your arguments logically, and express your opinion clearly and early in the piece. By refining these areas, your essay will not only become more effective and engaging but also align better with the expectations of an English proficiency test.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

However, the opponents still maintain that state-of-the-art digital devices are an impending threat to our lives. From my perspective, I partially agree with the aforementioned point of view. \n On the one hand, the mushrooming of news sites with innumerable sources of information has corrosive effects on netizens. First, due to being overwhelmed with loads of uploaded content, unratified contents such as provocative films, violent scenes are slackly managed. For this reason, these evils can be accessed without age restrictions, which may abuse individuals' physical and mental health, namely aggressive behavior, reaching puberty earlier, and even addiction. To clarify, children who play violent games without supervision tend to act deviantly and audaciously, and an addicted one may risk their life on guns and swords as they frequently do in games. Moreover, kids watching provocative films are proven to reach puberty earlier than usual, as well as develop harmful paraphilia. Those detrimental consequences are not only limited to children but also stretch to adults. Second, a large part of online news is uncensored and unverified. Therefore, individuals may be exposed to misleading information, gradually leading to distorted views and attitudes. \n On the other hand, expeditious internet dissemination will be a fertile breeding ground for gaining knowledge if all the aforementioned threats are properly managed. First, with a sundry of news sites and shared documents available, people are able to keep abreast of the latest regularities and social shifts freely. Second, the digital world with information exchange facilitates online study courses to be available, make education accessible to rural students. For example, The Science of Well-Being of Yale University, which is one of the most popular online psychological courses, has inspired millions of desperate people and navigated them to a brighter outlook on life. Moreover, learning online encourages self-study and learning at an individual's own pace, which will gradually improve self-discipline if performed properly. Last but not least, information access diversifies teaching methods, from mundane speech to vivid videos and presentations. In this way, the quality of education can be improved. \n Having discussed both viewpoints, It is my conviction that overwhelming information dissemination poses a threat on our lives. Nevertheless, its wonderful impact on our gaining knowledge.","There are 2 errors that will result in a failing score for the prompt restatement. The incorrect portions are: \n 1. The world is not on the ""threshold of impending advancement"", the world is already in the middle of technological advancements and shows no signs of slowing down. This is a slight misinterpretation of the original topic basis. \n 2. Why is there a mention of ""state of the art digital devices""? The original prompt left no word regarding these instruments of communication. Where did the writer get the idea that these should be mentioned as a part of the paraphrase? It's addition created a different discussion focus that will result in a failing interpretation score. \n As for the writer's opinion, his statement is incomplete. What would have completed it is the establishing sentence that he used in the concluding paragraph. The extent of his opinion as presented is really lacking since it does not establish the short reasons that would support his point of view. \n The discussion itself is also inappropriate. For this type of extent essay, the writer should stick to one opinion discussion. That means, both reasoning statements should take one topic that he can discuss based on: \n 1. Why he agrees with it \n 2. What reasons he has to also disagree with it / only partially support it. \n His current presentation does not establish these measured reasoning discussion points. So the essay is not as effective as it should be. It would have done the reasoning paragraphs better if he had paid attention to delivering the correct discussion format to show that he actually understood what the question was asking and how it should be discussed. \n There are problems with his discussion presentations as well. By presenting several reasons in the paragraph, but not appropriately developing the connecting discussions, he has created paragraphs that lack cohesiveness. He should focus on creating solid connections within 2 related reasons only, no more than that. Otherwise, he ends up with a paragraphs that lacks thought and reasoning development. He produces the current low scoring discussion paragraphs.","This essay addresses a vital and contemporary topic: the double-edged sword of technological advancements and information dissemination. The attempt to explore both the advantages and disadvantages of this surge in digital information is commendable. However, several areas need improvement to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and impact of the argument, making it more in line with English proficiency test standards.

First, the assertion that the world is on the ""threshold of technological advancement"" could be misleading, considering that we are already deeply integrated into this era of digital advancement. Instead, acknowledging the ongoing nature of these advancements could provide a more accurate starting point for the discussion. Additionally, the focus on ""state-of-the-art digital devices"" without direct prompting from the topic might divert the essay from its intended focus. Ensuring that the introduction directly responds to the given prompt without introducing extraneous elements is crucial for coherence and relevance.

The essay's opinion statement appears somewhat vague and could benefit from a clearer articulation of the author’s stance. Incorporating the concluding statement, which succinctly summarizes the viewpoint, into the introduction could strengthen the thesis and set a more definite direction for the discussion.

In terms of argument structure, the essay attempts to address both sides of the issue but falls short in maintaining a cohesive and focused argument. Adhering to a single line of reasoning, supported by well-developed examples and explanations, would significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness. Instead of presenting several loosely connected reasons, focusing on a couple of well-explored points could foster a more logical and persuasive argument. This would help avoid the pitfall of creating paragraphs that seem disjointed and lacking in depth.

While the essay does highlight some of the negative and positive impacts of technological advancements, it struggles with cohesiveness and depth in argumentation. For instance, the discussion on the potential harms and benefits of digital information exchange lacks solid connections and in-depth analysis. Concentrating on developing two related reasons, with clear, logical links between them, could offer a more compelling argument. This focus would not only improve the flow of information but also allow for a more thorough exploration of each point, enhancing the overall persuasiveness of the essay.

In conclusion, this essay offers a solid foundation for a discussion on technological advancement and information dissemination. However, improvements in accurately interpreting the prompt, refining the thesis statement, and focusing the argument would significantly enhance its clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. Simplifying the language and ensuring that each paragraph logically progresses from the last will also improve understandability and impact.",3,4,3,3,3,3,1,3,4,1,Argumentative

However, some people believe that other factors are more important. What other factors should also be considered when measuring a country's success? Do you think one factor is more important than others? \n There are many factors to assess a country such as economic, health, technology, and human rights. The success of a country could be seen in several aspects but in my opinion, the education system should be seen as the most essential factor instead of the economic progress \n The development of education, health, human rights, and technology should be considered as measures of a country's prosperity. Healthcare services and medical staff play a core role in improving people's quality of life and prolonging life expectancy. The development of technology makes it easy to approach the world and catch up with important information. A country cannot be flourished if the human rights are not guaranteed, oppression and exploitation, and gender inequality often only occur in underdeveloped and backward countries. Finally, the education system is the core that creates and improves the quality of the factors mentioned above.

You rightly identify several vital elements such as health, technology, human rights, and particularly, the education system, which you argue is the most essential factor. Your position is clear, and you've chosen a significant aspect to support your point of view. However, there are areas where your essay could be strengthened, both in terms of content and form. Here are specific points to consider for improvement:

1. **Integration and Focus**: Early in your essay, you mention several key factors (education, health, human rights, and technology) that can measure a country's success. To make your argument stronger and clearer, you could immediately highlight that while all these are important, you will focus on the education system as the pivotal measure of success. This approach will help set a clear direction for your essay right from the start.

2. **Development of Argument**: After introducing multiple factors, your essay primarily concentrates on education. This approach can make your essay appear underdeveloped concerning the other elements you mentioned. A more focused development on why education, in particular, is the most crucial factor, or a balanced examination of each factor you've listed, would make your argument more compelling and your essay more cohesive.

3. **Stylistic and Grammatical Precision**: Your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the subject but watch out for punctuation errors or missing punctuation marks, especially towards the end of paragraphs. These minor mistakes can disrupt the flow and clarity of your writing. It's beneficial to review your essay upon completion to catch and correct these errors.

4. **Clarity and Cohesion**: While your essay presents a valid perspective, the transition between discussing various success measures and focusing on education as the primary factor needs to be smoother. Establishing clear connections between paragraphs and within your overall argument can avoid confusion. Clear and logical transitions will help your reader follow your thought process more easily.

5. **Specific Examples and Evidence**: To enhance your argument, consider including more specific examples or statistical evidence demonstrating how an effective education system directly contributes to a country's success across different domains (health, technology, human rights). Doing so would add depth to your argument and provide a stronger base for your conclusion.

Your essay has a strong basis and an important message about considering broader measures of a country's success. By refining your focus, developing your ideas more thoroughly, and addressing the noted stylistic concerns, you can significantly improve the clarity, persuasiveness, and overall impact of your essay.

Why do you consider them role models? How do you live your life in a manner that would make them proud? How does your relationship with your parents define your character as a person?

Add to it as you deem necessary.","Your essay serves as a brief introduction to your educational background and your involvement in your family's business. However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to fully respond to the essay topic and provide a more compelling and detailed narrative.

1. **Response to the Topic**: It appears that the essay may have slightly missed the mark in addressing a specific topic, especially if the prompt was to delve into family background and personal development. When discussing your family and how they have shaped your personality and ambitions, it’s important to provide more detailed examples. Discuss how your parents have influenced you, the values they have instilled, and how these aspects have contributed to your character and life goals.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While there are no glaring spelling errors, your grammatical structures and stylistic choices could be improved to make the writing sound more mature and polished. For example, instead of saying ""I'm a person who interested in technology,"" consider ""I am deeply interested in technology."" This slight adjustment enhances the sophistication of your statement. Pay attention to verb tenses and the use of articles to ensure clarity and cohesion in your sentences.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view as an essay author is somewhat clear, in that you're sharing your personal journey and interests. However, it lacks depth in how these experiences and interests have shaped you as an individual. By presenting more specific instances of how engaging with technology or assisting in your family’s business has impacted you, your point of view would be strengthened and more effectively communicated.

4. **Arguments Supporting Your Position**: Although you mention your experiences, such as your family business involvement and interest in technology, these sections need to be expanded with clear, descriptive arguments. Explain what you learned from helping out with the family business and how it has prepared you for future challenges. Likewise, delve into how your interest in technology motivates your academic and career goals. Include examples and reflections to create a more vivid and persuasive narrative.

**Suggestion for Improvement**: Remember, your essay is a chance to tell your story in a way that captivates and informs the reader. To achieve this, incorporate more detailed stories and reflections about how your family background, personal interests, and experiences have shaped who you are today and who you aspire to be.

1. **Addressing the Topic:** Your essay needs to directly respond to the specific question asked: ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?"" It's crucial to clearly state your position regarding the importance of developing alternatives to fossil fuels as the essay's major priority and then support this position with arguments. Instead of broadly stating the importance, directly link your arguments to your level of agreement or disagreement with the prompt.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Pay attention to minor spelling and grammar errors. For instance, when you're making a list, remember to use commas correctly, and ensure consistency in verb tenses throughout your essay. Also, the use of lowercase letters at the beginnings of sentences, as seen with ""while"" and ""some,"" should be corrected to uppercase. These small details can significantly impact the clarity and professionalism of your writing.

3. **Clarity of Viewpoint:** Your viewpoint seems to lean towards agreement with the necessity of developing safe fuel alternatives, yet this stance needs to be explicitly stated at the beginning. A clear thesis statement at the end of the introduction can help set the tone for your essay and guide the reader through your arguments.

4. **Support for Your Arguments:** While you provide several reasons why finding alternatives to fossil fuels is essential, such as environmental concerns and the limitations of current alternatives like wind, water, and solar power, these arguments could be strengthened. Offering examples, statistics, or studies could substantiate your claims and make them more persuasive. Additionally, directly addressing counterarguments - such as the mention of poverty and diseases being possibly more pressing issues - with evidence or logic to refute them would make your position stronger.

To conclude, it's crucial for your essay to directly answer the prompt's question, clearly stating the extent to which you agree or disagree with the prioritization of developing safe alternatives to fossil fuels.

5. **Stylistic Issues**: Be mindful of your essay's flow and readability. Use transitions to smoothly connect your ideas between paragraphs, and vary your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. Additionally, avoid repetition and try to express your ideas as succinctly as possible.

6. **Point of View**: While your perspective on the topic is evident, reinforcing your viewpoint with more specific arguments and examples could strengthen your essay. Make it clear why you believe both government and individuals play a crucial role in environmental conservation, and how their efforts complement each other.

7. **Descriptive Arguments**: While you provided some arguments to support your position, focusing on the depth and development of one or two key arguments might be more effective than covering many with less detail. Offer in-depth analysis and evidence to back up your claims.

By addressing these aspects, you can enhance your essay's effectiveness and clarity, better communicate your arguments, and improve your performance on English proficiency tests.

This issue is definitely a controversial one. I personally believe that History and Science and Technology are equally important. In this essay, I would like to outline both views. \n We can learn the past from History and make the improvement for our future by Science and Technology. Archaeologists visit the unknown territories to excavate the ancient objects and analyze the topographies in order to know how the ancients lived. For example, Harappan Civilization flourished 5000 years ago with its great buildings and facilities. But a thousand years later their cities were abandoned due to the droughts. From this case, we have learned how the climate change affect people' live. And with the knowledge of Science and Technology, we find the way to perfect our drainage system and manage the water supply. \n Another example, people use candles to light up the rooms at night in ancient times. However, candles are not safe as it may cause fires. Later, Edison has invented the lamp with his knowledge of Science and Technology. Also, we want to hold the memories for our past, so camera is invented. All these changes make our live safe and convenient. \n In Conclusion, History and Science and Technology are both important. They should have the same proportion at the school subjects. So students can get ideas from History and make our lives better with Science and Technology.","aside from clarity issues, the only GRA related problem I can find in this essay is the missing comma after your introductory element within the last sentence of your concluding summary. There should be a comma after the word ""So"" to indicate a pause for the reader who should consider the content of the statement afterwards. \n While your approach to this essay paraphrase is different, I would not say that it is an accurate paraphrase. That is because the prompt paraphrase should not contain the reference to the pronoun ""I"" when indicating the topic instructions. This is not a direct response essay so you should not be making any direct declarations in the paraphrase because you will not be able to justify your presentation. I would have presented this, in what I believe is a more appropriate presentation as follows: \n <em>There is an ongoing discussion as to whether history or Science and Technology are more marked educational topics at the moment. Both sides have valid discussion points. I have my own opinion regarding this discussion. However, it would be better if a discussion of both sides are presented before I make any personal declarations.</em> \n Using the above prompt presentation, it becomes clear that a 5 paragraph essay will be presented using 3 reasoning paragraphs. This isn't a 4 paragraph essay because you need to present the following discussion points as individual paragraphs: \n 1. Public POV 1 \n 2 Public POV 2 \n 3. Personal Opinion \n Do not use the collective first pronoun ""we"" in the discussion because you are not discussing a personal opinion at first. The public POV should be presented using the third person pronouns instead. Secondary pronouns are indicated by: they. him, her, them. Ownership words or phrases can only be used such as ""Groups that believe"" or ""There are some people"", or even ""The supporters..."" Are some ownership phrases that show a clear reference to whose point of view is being discussed. The ""I"" pronoun should not come into play until the third reasoning paragraph. Based on these requirements, you can see why your discussion is not clear in terms of reference and how this essay can tend to confuse the reader. This is not a well written essay due to the improper use of reference pronouns. \n These mistakes however, are not the main reason that this essay will automatically get a failing score. You have written only 242 words. The essay is 8 words under the minimum word requirement of 250. As such deductions will be made for the missing word count and added to the other errors in your essay. This is the main reason why your work does not have a prayer of getting a passing score in an actual test setting.","The essay presents a discussion on the relative importance of History versus Science and Technology, aiming to argue that both subjects hold equal importance. There are several aspects of this essay that can be commended and others that need improvement to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of the argument.

Firstly, a strength of the essay is the use of examples to illustrate points, such as the Harappan Civilization and the invention of the lamp by Edison. These examples help to concretely demonstrate how both history and science and technology contribute to our understanding and improvement of the world.

However, there are a few areas that require attention to make the essay more effective:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to address the topic by stating that both History and Science and Technology are important. It's recommended to avoid using personal pronouns like ""I"" in the introduction when presenting the essay’s main topic. Instead, introduce the topic as a common debate or discussion without inserting personal opinion prematurely. For example, ""There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of History versus Science and Technology in educational curricula.""

2. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammar and stylistic issues that need addressing, such as the missing comma after introductory elements like “So” in the conclusion. It helps the reader to pause and understand the content that follows.

3. **Clarity and Pronoun Use**: Clarity can be improved by avoiding the use of collective pronouns like “we” when introducing general discussions or historical facts. The essay sometimes blurs personal opinions with general statements, which can confuse readers. It's better to use third-person pronouns (they/them) when discussing general points of view, saving personal pronouns (""I"") for explicitly stating personal opinions. 

4. **Structure and Argument Development**: Considering structuring the essay into five paragraphs where the first introduces the debate, the next three each cover a point of view (two public and one personal), and the last concludes the discussion. This structure helps in presenting a more organized argument.

5. **Word Count**: The essay is slightly under the required word count, which is crucial for meeting test criteria. Expanding on examples, adding another argument, or providing more detailed analysis could help meet the word count requirement while enriching the essay's content.

6. **Pronoun Reference**: Be cautious of proper pronoun references to avoid confusion. Present public opinions using phrases like “Groups that believe”, avoiding direct references to personal opinion until the personal opinion paragraph.

For improvements, consider revising the introduction to better set up the discussion without immediately stating personal bias. Also, more clearly separate discussions of public viewpoints from personal ones, adhering to a structured format that enhances the logical flow of arguments. Addressing these points should lead to a more coherent, persuasive, and well-structured essay.

In other word the student's motivation of study is the critical factor which is to determine the success of failure of an education. So it is understandable that many people give the attitude of pupil higher importance on the academic success. \n On the other hand, it is also agreed by others that teacher play the essential position to lead a success education. The good teacher must be the good student to himself, which means he can spot the needs and wants of his students by observation during lesson, and then work out the suitable teaching plans in order to improve the academic results of his pupils. \n In my opinion, I believe that a good teacher is the prime key toward the educational success as of his ability on motivating their students on study. Since they help to increase the number of students with good attitude, as a result this lead the higher chance of educational success in future. \n In conclusion, while some believe that both teaching staff and pupil are playing a vital factor on the success of education, I weight teacher the most due to their talent on influencing student to be more motivative on study, which toward the educational success as a result.","the first thing I want you to do is to stop agreeing with all the errors that are pointed out in your writing. Acknowledge the mistakes internally and try to stop making the same mistakes over and over again in your succeeding essays. The best way to acknowledge the advice is to have you show improvement in your writing. You do that by applying the corrections that are given to you. I hope I have myself clear about this. Acknowledging your mistakes, but then repeating the same errors, as you did in this essay, does nothing to help improve your writing skills. \n Now, I am sure that I have already advised you that not all task 2 essays are arguments. In order to figure out what discussion reference to use, look for the keyword in the essay. For this essay, the keyword is ""believe"". So you cannot say ""argue"" since there is no debate being referenced in the original discussion. Rather than ""argue"" you could say ""Some people think that..."". Think then takes the place of ""believe as a keyword. It is still related to the original prompt keyword. \n With regards to your sentences per paragraph. Try to create connected sentences rather than extremely long sentences that try to connect 2 different thoughts into one sentence presentation. Use transitional phrases or sentences to connect the sentences and paragraphs. You are lowering your GRA scoring potential by using only 2 long sentences per paragraph when the requirement is 3-5 sentences per paragraph. Your opening paraphrase is severely lacking in the context of the original reference. A better presentation is: \n <em>There are folks who think that teachers play a critical role in the education of a child. Others have the impression that it is the student who should be self inspired to achieve academic accomplishments. I will be considering both points of view in this essay in relation to my personal opinion.</em> \n Finally, you need to work on your vocabulary in relation to your sentence structure. There are two glaring errors in your presentation that I cannot omit mentioning in my review. The first has to do with the following: \n <quotation>The good teacher must be the good student to himself,</quotation> \n - I am sure this makes sense in your native language but the way you have this sentence structured in English doesn't make sense. What is the point of this phrase? What are you referring to? How you refer to the subject of the sentence is just as important as the subject itself. Without that clarity, the sentence becomes really confusing to the reader. \n <quotation>to determine the success of failure of an education. S</quotation> \n - This is grammatically wrong. You are offering the reader a choice in this sentence so the proper structure is ""success OR failure of ..."" Or being the keyword in a sentence offering the reader a choice. \n Now, I do not want you to say ""I agree that..."" in a response statement coming from you. That is tantamount to constantly apologizing for yourself and you have to stop with that defeatist attitude. It will not help you get any better with your writing skills. Just show me that you will not make the same mistakes in your future work. That is the best acknowledgement of mistakes and appreciation for the advice given that I and the others who will be advising you in this thread can receive from you :-)","This essay attempts to discuss the importance of both teachers and students in the educational process. However, there are several areas where improvements can greatly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the argument presented.

First, it's essential to ensure the essay directly responds to the topic. The use of the word ""argue"" might not be the best choice since the essay's prompt doesn't seem to call for a debate but rather an expression of belief. Consider using phrases like ""Some people think that..."" to more accurately reflect the essay's objective.

Second, the essay would benefit from more attention to sentence structure and vocabulary. Sentences like ""The good teacher must be the good student to himself,"" might be confusing. Clarifying and rephrasing such sentences to convey your meaning more clearly can significantly help. Also, when presenting choices, such as success or failure, the correct word to use is ""or"" rather than of, to avoid confusing the reader.

Moreover, the structure of your paragraphs could use some refinement. Instead of long sentences that merge two different ideas, aim for shorter, connected sentences. This not only makes your essay easier to read but also prevents lowering your score due to GRA (Grammar, Range, and Accuracy) issues. Using transitional phrases can help connect your sentences and paragraphs more smoothly.

Your opening could also be improved by directly addressing the essay's prompt with more context. An example of a clearer opening would be, ""There are folks who think that teachers play a critical role in the education of a child, while others believe it is up to the student to be self-motivated to achieve academic success. This essay will consider both perspectives before stating my personal view.""

It's also crucial to show progress by not repeating mistakes from previous essays. Acknowledging feedback and applying it to avoid similar errors in future essays demonstrates a commitment to improving your writing skills.

Lastly, remember that expressing agreement in your responses (""I agree that..."") might not be the most effective way to present your arguments. Instead, confidently state your opinions and use evidence to support them.

By focusing on these areas, your essay can convey your ideas more clearly and effectively. Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice and continuous learning. Keep striving to enhance your writing, and these efforts will surely be reflected in your future essays.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

From my point of view, I agree with this statement that we should continue looking after some ancient buildings and in this essay, I will explain my opinion. \n On the one hand, many old buildings have their values that we need to preserve. For instance, some historical buildings have witnessed their country's history from the past to the present such as Thang Long Imperial Citadel, and Turtle Tower in Ha Noi. Therefore, it not only has historical values but also our country's cultural values that we need to preserve for the next generation. \n On the other hand, even some buildings that do not have cultural values in the country, repairing them on some sides will be more economical than knocking down them. For instance, when building a more modern one, architects and designers need to update the newest technology which costs lots of money but may not bring advantages all the time. Meanwhile, the technology our generation used in the past was still fine and good if repairing them. \n Most importantly, building a new building causes many environmental problems in some ways. Examples of this are transporting materials for construction which is one of the causes of air pollution, using some building machines that can cause noise pollution which bothers lots of surrounding people, and so forth. As a result, if there are 10 old buildings that need to be reconstructed, these problems will proliferate. \n In conclusion, it is undeniable that many buildings are so old that we can not continue repairing and decorating them, so the government should take these old buildings into consideration whether they need to be knocked down and rebuilt due to their detrimental sides.",Avoid exaggerating your reference to the discussion topic as the examiner will definitely lower your score in that aspect.

Make sure that you do not overstate nor understate any information. Such mistakes will not help to improve your score. \n A comparison discussion cannot be used in this instance. The prompt requires you to defend your personal opinion. Indicating that your reasoning paragraphs should prove the correctness of your presentation. The clarity of your explanation and opinion defense becomes confusing when you try to explain both sides and offer some sort of supporting opinion for each. Your GRA score will be affected along with the C+C sections as you will be presenting information that does not support your originally supported stance.,"The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, which is that there is value in repairing and preserving old buildings instead of demolishing them for new constructions. This viewpoint is relevant to the topic and is consistently maintained throughout the essay. However, there are several areas where the essay can be significantly improved for clarity, persuasive effectiveness, and adherence to typical essay-writing standards required in English proficiency tests.

1. **Response to the Topic:** While the essay addresses the topic, it's important to ensure that your position is clear and focused right from the beginning. Avoid using exaggerated or overly dramatic language that could be seen as straying from the task or misrepresenting the discussion topic. Restate the subject using neutral language and focus on presenting your argument clearly and directly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay has a good overall structure, but there are minor grammatical errors and stylistic issues that can be improved. Pay attention to verb tense consistency, proper use of articles (""the government"" instead of just ""government""), and prepositions (""knocking down them"" should be ""knocking them down""). Also, consider simplifying complex sentences to make your arguments more direct and easier to follow.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view is apparent, but at times, the essay attempts to present a comparison discussion rather than firmly defending your opinion. Focus on strengthening your argument by providing specific examples and evidence that directly support your stance without offering contradictory viewpoints.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay provides several arguments in support of preserving old buildings, which is good. However, the essay should avoid presenting any supporting opinions for the counter-argument unless it directly strengthens your primary argument. This can confuse readers about your stance. For every point made in favor of preserving old buildings, ensure that the reasoning is sound, and the examples are directly relevant and supportive of your viewpoint.

In conclusion, to make your essay more compelling and clear, stick closely to defending your own opinion throughout, avoid overgeneralizations or exaggerations, and aim for clarity and precision in your language. Focus on presenting logical and well-supported arguments that clearly articulate the value of preserving older buildings. Strengthening these areas will make your essay more persuasive and improve its coherence, which is crucial for a higher score in English proficiency assessments.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

First, it's crucial to ensure that your essay directly responds to the topic or question. Clarify the question or statement your essay addresses at the beginning. If there's a specific prompt you're responding to, make sure your essay fully answers that prompt.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several points to consider:
- Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, for example, “every new activity is experiencing” may be better as “every new activity offers experience.”
- Use consistent pronouns to avoid confusion, for example, “when young people do Benji jump, she/ he knows...” could be clearer if you consistently use either ""she"" or ""he"" or switch to ""they"" for a gender-neutral option.
- Ensure clarity in your sentences; at times, the structure makes it hard to understand the point being made. For instance, “All new look as try extreme sport is interesting and of course new experience.” could be rewritten for clarity.
- Watch out for repetitive or missing words and phrases to improve readability.

Your point of view appears to be that while sports are important and young people should be encouraged to try them, participating in extreme sports should be a personal choice. This stance is visible throughout your essay, but making your thesis statement clearer at the beginning could strengthen your argument.

Your essay would benefit from more specific examples and clearer, more descriptive arguments to support your point of view:
- When discussing the benefits of extreme sports, offer clear examples of what individuals can learn from these experiences.
- When mentioning the dangers, include statistics or real-life cases to support your argument.
- The conclusion introduces a new idea – talking about extreme sports so young people are aware of them. It’s better to avoid introducing new information in the conclusion and instead, summarize and reinforce the points made throughout the essay.

Finally, the conclusion could more effectively summarize your essay's key points and reiterate your main stance without adding new information. Aim to leave the reader with a clear understanding of your position on the topic.

To solve the problem of rising temperature, we have to lessen the emission of greenhouse gas, especially CO2, and there are two aspects to consider: government and individual. \n Since industrialisation, the emission of CO2 has been getting higher and higher, and thus the global temperature is risen to the extent that climate change is threatening all countries. Factories and transportations are two main sources of greenhouse gas. The other industry that generate a huge amount of greenhouse gas is livestocks since human beings become more craving for meat and dairy products. In short, the human needs cause those industries to happen, and there is no limit to their development so that human beings and all the other animals are suffering from the destroyed environment. \n It is impossible to stop all factories and transportations. Instead, the government should invest in green energy that does not require petrol and other resources and thus generate CO2. A stricter regulation on how much greenhouse gas is allowed to be emitted by factories should also be considered. While the government is making new policy, we as individuals can change our lifestyle to lessen the greenhouse footprints: eating less meat and taking public transportation. Boycotting companies that are not willing to devote to solve global warming is another effective way everyone can do. \n In conclusion, human activities are very likely to generate greenhouse gas and therefore make global temperature higher.

The importance of both government and individual actions in reducing these emissions is well-articulated. However, there is room for improvement in various aspects to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the argumentation presented.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay responds to the topic, but the introduction and conclusion could be more effective. An improved introduction should succinctly paraphrase the topic, outline the reasons behind the issue, and preview the solutions to be discussed. Similarly, the conclusion should restate the problem, summarize the key reasons and solutions provided, and offer a final thought or call to action. By refining these sections, the essay will provide a clearer and more compelling argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay contains a few errors that need attention. For instance, ""phenomena"" should be ""phenomenon"" when referring to a singular subject, and ""livestocks"" should be ""livestock"" as it is already plural. Additionally, maintaining consistent verb tense and refining sentence structure will improve readability. It's also crucial to use more specific and varied vocabulary to precisely articulate points without repetition. Reviewing and revising for these errors will not only enhance clarity but also demonstrate a strong command of the English language.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The point of view is clear; human activities contribute significantly to global warming, with an emphasis on the role of government and individuals in mitigating this issue. This standpoint could be strengthened by explicitly stating it in the introduction, reasserting it throughout the body paragraphs with more descriptive arguments, and reinforcing it in the conclusion.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay provides a range of arguments, these could be more detailed and descriptive. For instance, when discussing solutions, specific examples of green energy technologies or successful regulations from other countries would provide concrete evidence to support the argument. Additionally, when suggesting lifestyle changes for individuals, offering practical tips or citing studies showing the impact of such changes could make the argument more persuasive.

In summary, focusing on sharpening the introduction and conclusion, correcting grammatical and stylistic issues, and enriching the arguments with specific, descriptive details will significantly improve the essay.

Then, use the body paragraphs for a detailed discussion, saving your final thoughts for the conclusion. This structure will provide a clearer roadmap for your readers.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For example, ""a color gives a certain impact in the people's mood"" could be revised to ""colors have a certain impact on people's moods."" Also, be cautious with the use of plural and possessive forms (e.g., ""office's and hospital's interior"" should be ""offices and hospitals' interiors""). Simplifying your sentence structure may help avoid these issues.

4. **Clarity of Viewpoint**: Your viewpoint is generally clear, but making your statements more direct and using straightforward language can enhance this. Instead of saying ""I personally argue that it is true that particular color affects people's feel such purple color promote,"" simplify it to ""I believe that certain colors, like purple, can enhance people's mood by promoting feelings of peace and spirituality.""

5. **Arguments and Support**: You've done well to include research and expert opinions to support your viewpoint, such as the study from Colorado University and insights from Anna Waitford. These references are valuable and should be highlighted. However, ensuring each paragraph focuses on a single idea or example will make your arguments more digestible and impactful.

6. **General Suggestions**: To improve readability and flow, consider using transition words between sentences and paragraphs. Also, proofread your essay or use tools to check for grammar and spelling mistakes.

By focusing on these areas, your essay will become more concise, engaging, and easier to follow, significantly improving its effectiveness in conveying your argument on the impact of colors on health and productivity.",3,4,4,4,4,3,1,3,4,1,Argumentative

This essay discuss about an organisations believes on employees to dress smartly or value quality of work over appearance and will be in favour of latter. \n Firstly, when an organisations wants their staff to dress smartly, the main reason behind this is that it helps people feel more confident and gives a sense of responsibility towards work. Employee who do not dress properly indicates lack of intrest and especially when it is the leads or senior management it gives out a message of unprofessionality and it might directly impact the work and the growth of an organisation. \n On the other hand, some argue that the quality of work is more important that dressing smartly as quality in work and its outcome is what which brings customers or users to the organisation. Hence helps in achieving an organisation goals. Dressing comfortably helps the employees to work with concentration and for extented period of times. \n In my opinion, dressing smartly should only be a chooice not mandatory and I believe quality of work has greater importance over appearance. \n In conclusion, even tho dressing smartly help some employees in differnent ways without quality it will become difficult for an organisation to grow consistently and achieve it's goals.","The first paragraph contains a full sentence of information not related to the original information presented.

After all, the minimum word count is 250. Overall, there is nothing in this written presentation that meets the requirements of a Task 2 essay.","Your essay addresses an interesting topic: the importance of dressing smartly versus focusing on the quality of work in the context of job interviews and organizational expectations. Let's delve into specific areas that can help you improve your essay writing.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
Your essay broadly addresses the given topic by examining both the importance of appearance and the quality of work. However, the introduction seems to deviate from the core topic by discussing the interview process, which isn't directly related to the main focus on dress code and work quality. Make sure every part of your essay directly contributes to your argument on the stated topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
There are several areas where your essay can benefit from closer attention to spelling, grammar, and style. For example, pay attention to subject-verb agreement (""an organization wants"" instead of ""an organisations wants"") and the use of singular/plural nouns (""An organisation"" instead of ""An organisations""). Using the correct form of words and ensuring sentences are structurally sound will significantly improve the readability of your essay. Additionally, consider using more varied sentence structures to make your writing more engaging.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
Your viewpoint becomes clear towards the end of your essay when you state your preference for prioritizing the quality of work over appearance. However, making your perspective and reasoning clear from the beginning will strengthen your argument. Ensure your thesis statement in the introduction succinctly presents your stance.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Point of View:**
Your essay outlines reasons why organizations might value dressing smartly and why others prioritize work quality. Yet, the arguments sometimes lack depth and specific examples that could make your position more compelling. For each point you raise, consider adding real-life examples, data, or more detailed explanations to substantiate your views.

5. **Additional Feedback Based on Provided Criteria:**
- Be mindful of meeting essay requirements like the minimum sentence per paragraph, which helps in structuring your arguments cohesively. Strive for 3-5 sentences per paragraph to develop your ideas fully.
- Enhancing the development of your personal opinion can make your essay stronger. Rather than simply stating your view, elaborate on why you hold that perspective with detailed reasoning and support.

Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice and feedback. Focusing on these areas should help you craft more focused, coherent, and persuasive essays in the future. Keep writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback on your progress.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Through a series of rhythmic body movements people express themselves and their unique culture. I am in agreement with the statement that dancing has an important role in a culture, mainly because: it embodies the culture's unique history, in addition to it being unique. \n Firstly, a country's traditional dance wasn't choreographed over a night, but developed over several historical events. The dance signifies many moments in the nation's history, as if it is telling a story. For example, the Egyptian horse dance tells us many things about the history of the locals. Historically, the horse has been embedded in most of their life aspects, and there is a clear connection between the horse and his master. On inspection, you will see that the connection between the former and the latter is not of mere submission but rather a collaboration of some sort. \n On the other hand, traditional body movements are unique to each country. It is a form of expression that is specific to its people, no folkloric sway is similar to another. For instance, the Ukrainian and Polish dances may seem very similar at first glance, given that the two nations share a border, and a lot of history together seems as a reasonable justification. However, to the trained eye they are completely unalike, the Ukrainian dance has much more leaps in it than the Polish one, while the second includes more partner dances. So, even though they may stem from the same roots, they are entirely unique. \n In conclusion, time-honored dances are a part of human history. They tell a story about a nation's history and ways, and they are a unique form of expression. For all the preceding reasons I find the notion of dancing having an important role in a culture to be agreeable. Next time you meet someone from a different place, ask him about his people's classical dance, you will indeed learn a lot.","Try to avoid using contractions in your academic writing presentations. Always spell out the 2 words necessary to deliver the thought. So ""wasn't"" should be ""was not"". It is just a matter of respecting the reader and also, showing that you know how to write formally, using proper English writing instructions. \n Since you are not discussing an opinion contrary to the first one presented in the second paragraph, it should not be kicked off by saying ""On the other hand"". That phrase is only used when discussing 2 opposing statements. Which is why it is paired with the reference ""On the one hand"" for the first presentation. It indicates differing points of view rather than a continuing and supporting discussion in the next paragraph. \n Good work just the same. You stayed on topic and supported your discussion with relevant and impressive explanations / examples. This shows a great degree of English comprehension abilities on your part, which made the presentation engaging and informative to read. That skill will definitely help your score in the actual test.","Your essay effectively addresses the topic, emphasizing the significant role of dance in representing a culture's unique heritage and identity. Your arguments are well-structured and provide a clear understanding of your viewpoint, highlighting the importance of dance as not only an artistic expression but also a historical and cultural narrative.

To further enhance your essay, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Avoid Contractions**: In formal academic writing, it's best to avoid using contractions such as ""wasn't"". Instead, use the full forms like ""was not"". This not only adheres to formal writing standards but also demonstrates your understanding and respect for academic writing conventions.

2. **Phrase Usage**: The phrase ""On the other hand"" is typically used to introduce a contrasting argument or point of view. Since your second argument is not opposing but rather builds on your initial point, reconsider using this phrase. To ensure clarity in your argumentation, simply continue with your discussion or use connectors that indicate addition or reinforcement of your points, rather than contrast.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay benefits from clear and descriptive arguments, which are effectively supported by relevant examples. However, enhancing the transitions between your points could improve the overall coherence. Be mindful of how you structure your arguments and consider guiding your reader more smoothly from one point to the next.

4. **Engagement and Understanding**: You have done a commendable job of engaging with the topic and presenting your arguments in a way that reflects a strong comprehension of the subject matter. Your use of examples to support your points makes your essay informative and engaging, showcasing your English proficiency.

4085,https://essayforum.com/writing/extent-advantages-memorization-outweigh-92551/,test,IELTS Task2: To what extent do the advantages of memorization outweigh the disadvantages?,"Copying the context of textbooks frequently is common in a vast of education systems. Some people argue that there are a lot of advantages of it, while I completely believe that its cons are far more than pros and I will discuss it below. \n Studying, again and again, results in some excellent benefits. In particular, it has become a constant way that most students keep for so long. First of all, it gives our brain so much stimulation that we remember the terminology of our subjects, especially those professional ones. Secondly, nailing down a concept in certain topics takes more time than memorizing it repeatedly, which we could contribute to the other issues we might be interested in. Therefore, repetition for studying is effective compared to other ways. \n However, I hold the position that its shortages surpass what we gain from it. To begin with, what we usually ignore is that we will not forget the knowledge of particular fields if we coherently understand the heads or tails of them. Focusing on the importance of memorizing is totally impractical, as students even write down a huge amount of notes instead of figuring out the concepts. Furthermore, rote learning does not highlight applications. This means we might remember a large number of words theoretically rather than practising them in real life. \n In conclusion, there are undoubtedly lots of benefits of memorization for education. But I reckon they hardly outweigh the disadvantages. \n Any suggestion is much appreciated previously. I have a difficulty on writting for long.","Memorization is not the same as copying text. Memorization means""to commit to memory"". It requires repeated reading. copying refers to repeated writing. Those are 2 different actions. This incorrect word replacement will lower the vocabulary score since it shows a problem with word meaning and an alteration of the discussion topic. There is a clear task inaccuracy in the statement. \n The writer incorrectly responded to the question as well. The discussion premise for defense has been supplied. That is the only discussion that should be present in the reasoning and opinion statement. By not using the supplied discussion basis, the writer has changed the discussion and therefore, not followed the task / writing instructions. This will result in a non-passing score even as points are partially provided due to an unrelated discussion presentation.","This essay presents a thoughtful perspective on the topic of memorization in educational systems, touching on the advantages and disadvantages of this learning approach. However, there are areas where the essay could be improved to better meet the criteria of the given assignment and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears there has been a misunderstanding regarding the primary focus of the assignment. The essay discusses memorization, which involves committing information to memory through repetition. The assignment, however, seems to have intended for a discussion on the action of copying text from textbooks. These are distinct activities – memorization is about internalizing information, while copying involves reproducing text verbatim. Clarifying and directly addressing the intended topic is crucial for the essay to be considered fully responsive to the assignment.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally well-written with minor errors. However, attention to smoother transitions between ideas and more varied sentence structures could enhance readability and flow. Additionally, watch out for terms like ""a vast of education systems"" which is awkwardly phrased; ""in a vast number of education systems"" would be more appropriate. Ensuring sentences are complete and ideas are presented clearly will also strengthen the essay.

3. **Author's Point of View:** The point of view is consistent and clear throughout the essay. The writer firmly believes that the disadvantages of memorization outweigh the advantages. Ensuring that the point of view is supported by relevant arguments, especially ones that closely align with the assigned topic, will further solidify the stance taken.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Position:** The essay presents arguments for both the benefits and drawbacks of memorization. However, to strengthen these arguments, it would be beneficial to directly tie them back to the topic of copying text, if that is the intended subject of the essay. Providing concrete examples and situating arguments within the proper context will make them more compelling. Furthermore, exploring the impact of copying text, as distinct from memorization, on learning and application of knowledge could offer deeper insights and more directly address the assignment.

In summary, refocusing the essay to align more closely with the assigned topic by clarifying the distinction between memorization and copying text will greatly improve its relevance. Enhancing the structure and clarity of the essay, while ensuring that arguments directly support the corrected understanding of the topic, will make for a stronger, more compelling piece. Keep striving to express ideas clearly and directly, and remember to always ensure your writing directly addresses the assignment prompt.",4,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Some think the health care is the government's responsibility, while others see this as personal diet affair. However, I believe both government and individuals should equally pay attention to this issue. This essay will discuss both notions with explanations involved. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that the government have obligation to provide complete perception of healthy diet. The government can give some suggestion on organic agriculture, providing farmers to cultivate better crops. Besides, the government can also improve the sanity facilities, giving clean water for household use. For example, Taiwan government holds workshops for local farming and ranching, owners of farms and cattle ranch learn the modern measures which can grow corps without using pesticides. Subsequently,the citizens enjoy the organic food by following the government's instruction. \n On the other hand, it is indisputable that the individuals should take care their own diet. In order words, the health condition only is well known by ourselves. For stark instance, the patients who have high blood pressure know which food is much more proper for them. They cannot ingest too much fried food, meat and processed food. It is better for them to eat vegetables and fruits, such as onion, tomato, corn, apple and banana, etc. However, the patients with other disease have other diet list from nutritionists. As a result, individuals know their personal diet most, they should take care of their health by themselves. \n By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position. I believe it is equally important for the government and individuals to response for paying attention on healthy diet. The government support to improve the food and environment quality while the individuals ingest the nutrient foods. \n <291 words>","Dear student, Your opening statement shows that you have been learning how to properly paraphrase prompts. There is however, one tiny mistake that you made which would affect your score. Please be ever conscious of the fact that an opinion is never presented in the opening paraphrase as there is no room for you to explain your opinion in that paragraph. Aside from that problem, and the fact that you should have said ""health care"" instead of ""health take care"", the paraphrase could earn you a pretty decent TA score that could boost your chances to pass the test. \n One other problem, is that your second paragraph does not discuss the responsibility of the government when it comes to promoting a healthy diet. You should not be discussing how the government should help the farmers in this instance. You should be discussing how the government should oversee the restaurants and their menus, offering healthier alternatives to the current slew of junk food being offered. This is, after all, an essay about diet considerations, not farmer cultivation problems. \n Your third paragraph is on the mark. But you did not present a personal opinion as indicated in the essay. Always remember that the personal opinion is not considered part of the closing statement. That is always completely defended paragraph presented prior to your concluding statement. In this instance, the essay does not have a proper closing statement. \n Now, as per points deductions, the problems I indicated above will have an overall effect on your TA score. Which means the TA score you will get for this essay will not be so high because of the problems that you have. Once the TA clocks in with a lower than passing score, it will be difficult for you to pass the rest of the requirements and the test in general.","The essay begins with a good attempt to paraphrase the prompt, showing a clear understanding of the topic concerning health care responsibilities. However, there's an important aspect to improve: the presentation of personal opinions should not happen in the opening. In academic essays, especially in English proficiency tests, the introduction serves to present the topic and outline the discussion points without revealing your stance. Additionally, the term ""health take care"" is not correct; it should be ""health care.""

Moving on to the body paragraphs, the essay successfully identifies two different perspectives on the issue. The discussion on the government's role, however, slightly misses the mark. The focus on assisting farmers and improving agricultural practices, while relevant to health, does not directly address the essay's central theme of diet and personal health care. A more fitting approach would be to explore how the government can influence healthier dietary choices among the populace, possibly through regulations on food industries or public health campaigns.

The essay shines when discussing the individual's responsibility toward their own diet. This section effectively uses examples to support the notion that personal health is a matter of individual awareness and choice. This demonstrates an understanding of the essay's second point of view but remember, a well-rounded essay should also reflect your personal stance clearly outside of the conclusion. It's important to integrate your perspective distinctly in the body of the essay before wrapping up your arguments.

Regarding the conclusion, it reiterates the essay's main stance but could be strengthened by summarizing the key arguments made. A robust conclusion ties all points together, reinforcing the essay's overall argument and your viewpoint.

In terms of language and style, be mindful of minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. These include the occasional incorrect word choice and grammar mistakes. For example, ""take care their own diet"" should be ""take care of their own diet."" Paying attention to these details can significantly improve the clarity and professionalism of your writing.

However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to enhance coherence, relevance, and overall effectiveness. Below are specific feedback points aimed at guiding your revision process:

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: It's crucial to remain focused on the specific subject posed by the essay question. The introduction of unrelated discussions, such as the impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, deviates from the primary topic. Concentrate on direct responses and solutions related to the initial prompt regarding fuel costs and environmental issues without shifting to broader or unrelated themes.

2. **Clarity of Opinion**: Your essay should begin with a clear, unequivocal statement of your stance on the issue. Phrases like ""to a certain extent"" can create ambiguity about your position. A stronger approach would be to directly state your opposition or support, followed by a concise summary of your reasoning. For example, saying ""I strongly oppose the increase in fuel costs as a solution, and will discuss alternative measures"" sets a clear tone and prepares the reader for your arguments.

3. **Development of Arguments**: While you suggest alternative solutions, such as promoting public transportation and utilizing renewable energy, further development and explanation of these ideas are needed. Discuss not only what the solutions are but also how they can effectively address the issues at hand. Each proposed solution should be clearly explained and supported with specific reasons or examples in separate paragraphs to maintain clarity and organization.

4. **Word Count and Structure**: Your essay fell just short of the required word count, which can affect your score. Aim for slightly above the minimum word count to ensure you meet requirements and provide enough detail in your arguments. Also, ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single idea or solution to maintain a coherent and logical structure throughout your essay.

5. **Accuracy and Assumptions**: Your writing should accurately reflect the essay prompt without adding unfounded assumptions or information not present in the original discussion. Stick closely to the prompt’s specifics to ensure your essay remains on topic and relevant.

6. **Grammar and Spelling**: Pay close attention to spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues. Proofreading your essay can help identify and correct errors, leading to a clearer and more professional presentation.

By focusing on these points, you can significantly improve your essay.

You have to make sure that you develop your English thinking skills to the point where you are transliterating from your mother language to your second language. The clarity of your reasoning definitely gets lost in translation. I do not advise learning to write in English by watching English subtitled movies because the main complaint native English speakers have about those films is that the subtitles are often incorrect in English word reference.

However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. 

1. **Responsiveness to the Topic**: Your essay does address the topic, but the arguments need to be clearer and directly related to the question. Ensure every paragraph contributes toward answering the topic at hand, establishing a strong linkage between the problem and the discussed solutions.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay contains several grammar and stylistic issues which affect its readability. Misuse of words and sentence structures makes it hard for readers to follow your arguments. It is crucial to focus on building simple, clear sentences to convey your points effectively. Practice constructing sentences that flow logically from one to the next.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view seems to be that the affordability of sugar-sweetened beverages leads to their increased consumption and related health issues, and that solutions could include tax strategies and providing healthier alternatives. However, this point gets lost due to the essay's structural and linguistic issues. Aim for more straightforward expressions of your views.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you attempt to support your points with arguments, they often come across as vague or underdeveloped. It’s important to use specific examples and clear, descriptive language to bolster your arguments. Each claim you make should be backed up with evidence or a clearer explanation.

**Additional Suggestions for Improvement**:

- **Simplify Your Language**: Use simpler language to make your essay more comprehensible. Complex words or incorrectly used vocabulary can obscure your message. Remember, clarity is key.

- **Focus on Sentence Structure**: Work on improving your sentence structure to build a logical and smooth flow of ideas. Each sentence should lead naturally to the next, making your arguments easy to follow.

- **Develop English Proficiency**: Enhancing your English proficiency beyond translation can improve your writing significantly. Consider reading books translated from your native language to English to get a better grasp of proper word usage and sentence formation. This practice can be more beneficial than relying on English subtitled movies, which may contain inaccuracies.

- **Read and Revise**: Always read through your essay multiple times to catch and correct errors. If possible, have someone else read it too, as they might catch mistakes you overlooked.

Improvement in these areas will make your essays clearer, more persuasive, and effective in communicating your viewpoints. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to seek feedback on your progress.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live at home with their parents. There are some differences between dormitory and house such as living expenses, private space, social relationship and the distance to shcool. One noticeable difference between the two places is living expenses. Living in dormitory will have a lot of expenses for example, rent, electricity, water, internet bills can put a ton of financial strain on students. Some students have to work part-time jobs to afford those expenses. In contrast, living with parents at home, students do not need to worry much about living expenses because their parents can help them. Besides, living in dormitory can take away private space because in a room usually have 4 to 8 people that makes it difficult for students to concentrate on studying and resting. It is also impossible to express our voice of points since there are many different opinions in a room. Nevertheless, living in a house is more freedom and privacy. There are no curious eyes from roommates that may bother us.","This discussion should have been divided into 3 parts. One introduction paragraph, another representation paragraph from dorm living, and a separate one for home living. That way all the comparison points and discussion points will be well presented to the reader. This statement feels incomplete. As if you did not really give much thought to writing it, which is why you did not bother to properly format it. A paragraph that has more than 1 topic sentence presented will always be under developed or not fully explained. You need to learn to write paragraphs with 5 sentences each so that you can clearly explain your topic sentences with supporting discussions and examples. \n The information presented is good, if you do not consider the improper format. You obviously know what you are talking about and understand the importance of the topic you were given to discuss. Not bad for a practice English writing essay. You just need to properly build up your skills in the next exercise.","Your essay touches on an important topic regarding the living choices of university students, focusing on the differences between living in dormitories and living with parents. You've done a good job highlighting key differences such as living expenses, private space, social relationships, and distance from school. Your understanding of the subject is clear and you present a perspective that is easy to follow. However, there are ways to strengthen your essay and make your argument more compelling.

**Improvements:**

1. **Structure:** Consider organizing your essay into three main parts: an introduction, one paragraph discussing dormitory living, and another discussing living at home. This structure will help present your points more clearly and allow you to develop each argument fully. Each paragraph should focus on a single main idea, supported by examples or further explanation.

2. **Development:** Aim to expand each paragraph to around five sentences. This expansion will give you space to explain your ideas in more detail. For instance, when you mention the expense of living in a dormitory, consider adding a sentence about specific costs or how these impact students. Similarly, when discussing the benefits of living at home, you could elaborate on how this arrangement can provide emotional support aside from financial benefits.

3. **Spelling and Grammar:** Watch out for minor spelling and grammar issues. For instance, ""of ten"" should be ""often"" and ""shcool"" should be ""school"". These small mistakes can distract from your message. 

4. **Stylistic Issues:** Be mindful of how you present your arguments. Avoid making broad generalizations without providing examples. When you mention the lack of private space in dormitories, perhaps include a brief anecdote or a hypothetical scenario that illustrates this challenge. 

5. **Clear Point of View:** Your viewpoint comes through in the essay, but you could make it even clearer by stating your preference or conclusion on the matter. For example, after presenting the pros and cons of each living situation, you might conclude by suggesting which option you believe is generally better for students, or under what circumstances one might be preferable over the other.

6. **Descriptive Arguments:** Your arguments would benefit from more descriptive language and specific examples. When talking about the freedom and privacy of living at home, describe what this freedom allows students to do, or how privacy enhances their study time.

Remember, the goal of your essay is not only to compare dormitory and home living but also to engage and convince the reader of your perspective. By refining your structure, expanding your explanations, and correcting minor errors, you will greatly improve your essay's clarity and persuasiveness.

I want to share two stories about telling the true. \n The first one is about love. Love needs to tell the truth. We could image a scenario, a man met a female who isn't his girlfriend just for business many times in the night. However, he would not tell the true to his girlfriend cause he doesn't want to be asked more. Then one day, his girlfriend finds it by her friend, even the man isn't cheat with her, maybe she can't trust him. The worst thing is that she would misunderstand with him every time when he goes home late even though he is working in the company. If a couple they can't trust each other, they would break up in the end. Therefore, I think trust is the basic fundamental in love relationship. Telling the true always could keep marriage for a long time. \n The second one is about working, place. In business and career, telling the true creates the trust between client and companies, employee and employers, including colleagues. Take me for example, one year ago, my boss told me I had a promotion next year, it was a honor also a responsibility. I felt happy and work harder in order to convince that I was a qualified candidate. However, when the candidate list showed up, I found there was not include my name. I felt very upset, my boss treated me! Then, my boss told me the true is I can't reach the requirement of promotion, he also felt upset like me. It doesn't matter for me, because he lied to me at beginning. After that, every time he asked me to do more and said I would gain more rewards, I couldn't believe him. Finally, I left my company because my boss lost his credit. \n Honesty is the best policy.

If it is, then you need to make sure that you begin your line of reasoning within the last few sentences of the opening paragraph. You also need to make sure that you fully explain what the original prompt for the discussion is and how you are expected to discuss it. \n I would not use vague references to love and the workplace for this essay. Those two are too theoretical in nature when you consider that the discussion would like to hear about relatable examples from you. Since love and the workplace discussions vary per person and experience, that is not really going to help with your discussion. When examples are called for, it is always best to use your personal reference or experience for the examples. \n By the way, you can't say ""tell the true"" or ""Telling the true"" in the essay because the correct term is ""Truth"", it is a keyword from the original prompt and should be used frequently throughout your essay. \n Additionally, always remember to use the concluding paragraph to properly summarize and wrap up the discussion. Use 3 sentences at least. One poorly developed run on sentence won't help your score.","This essay presents a viewpoint on the importance of truth in building good relationships, touching on scenarios from both personal relationships and the workplace. However, there are several areas that could benefit from improvement to enhance clarity, relevance, and the overall effectiveness of the message.

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: It's crucial to ensure your essay directly responds to the question asked. Your introduction should clearly state your main argument and briefly outline how you plan to support it. While the essay attempts to do this, it falls short in explicitly connecting the stories to the importance of truth in developing good relationships. Try to provide a more direct response to the essay prompt at the beginning.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are recurrent errors such as ""telling the true"" which should be corrected to ""telling the truth"". Consistent grammatical errors, including tense inconsistencies and singular/plural mistakes, distract from your message. Simplifying your sentence structure can help avoid these errors. Also, it's beneficial to vary your sentence lengths and structures to create a more engaging narrative.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The essay intends to argue that truth is fundamental in maintaining healthy relationships, both personal and professional. However, this viewpoint could be articulated more clearly by directly stating it at the beginning and ensuring each paragraph supports this central idea. Use clear topic sentences at the start of each paragraph to guide the reader through your argumentation.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay uses two broad examples to argue for the importance of honesty. While these examples are relevant, they could be made more effective by grounding them in specific, relatable experiences. Avoid generalizations about love and the workplace; instead, focus on personal anecdotes or more detailed scenarios that illustrate your points vividly. Additionally, ensure you elaborate on why these examples support your viewpoint, creating a stronger link between your argument and the evidence provided.

5. **Conclusion**: The essay would benefit from a more developed conclusion. A conclusion should not only summarize the main points discussed but also reinforce the significance of the essay's argument. Aim to use at least three sentences to recap your key points and state why your argument matters, providing a clear and impactful ending to your essay.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly enhance the clarity, relevance, and persuasiveness of your writing.

As a result, the child may be forced to comply with these policies and change their habits to live healthier and lose weight.

The response is relevant to the topic, and the point of view is clear. You argue that while the government has a significant role, parents also have essential responsibilities. The strengths of this essay include choosing a pressing social issue and presenting arguments for both sides effectively. However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary for a better score in English proficiency tests.

1. **Adherence to English Writing Rules:** The consistent mistake of not capitalizing the first letter of new sentences significantly impacts the overall quality and readability of your essay. Remember, in English writing, the first word of a sentence always starts with a capital letter. This error affects the grammar range and accuracy of your essay, which is a critical aspect of your score.

2. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style:** The essay has several grammar and spelling issues that need attention. For instance, 'child's obesity problems' should be 'childhood obesity problems', and 'vietnam' should be capitalized as 'Vietnam'. Attention to such details is crucial. Also, avoid starting sentences with 'because' if possible, as it can make your argument seem less formal or cohesive.

3. **Clarity and Descriptiveness:** While you have provided examples to support your arguments, some parts of the essay could benefit from clearer and more descriptive language. For instance, explaining how parental influence and government policies directly impact children's health can make your argument stronger. Also, phrases like 'the child may be forced to comply' could be clearer. Specify who or what might force compliance for a stronger argument.

4. **Coherence and Cohesion:** The essay sometimes jumps from one idea to another without smooth transitions. To improve, ensure each paragraph flows logically to the next. Use transitional phrases such as ""On the other hand"" or ""Furthermore"" to guide the reader through your argument seamlessly.

5. **Argument Structure:** While you have a good approach by addressing both the government's and parents' roles, the essay sometimes implies that parents' responsibility is 'secondary' without fully exploring their importance. Emphasize that both roles are crucial, each in their unique way, and avoid seeming to rank them. This approach will strengthen your position.

In conclusion, the topic choice and the balanced view are strong points of your essay. By focusing on the grammar and accuracy, improving your argument's clarity and descriptiveness, and ensuring smooth transitions between ideas, you will significantly enhance the quality of your writing.

Evaluating the both sides, the policy depended on common grounds are likely to be successful, prevents the further suffering of citizen and leads to faster development of a country. \n Quixotic goal, unlike real goal, are appealing when some politician gives speech about it, their goal seems grandiose, but rarely are achieved because in idealistic goal various parameter helping to shape an aim are trifle compared to actual need of parameter for achieving such goal. Nepal is reach in hydro resource, for instance, it has potential to generate upto 1200 Megawatt electricity. However, since the country lacks various infrastructure- funding, technical man power- and potential water resources are located in inaccessible areas, it is hard for Nepal to achieve optimum utilization of water resources. However, policy to harness the full power of resources has been implemented for 20 years and completion rate is not more than 5 percent. Instead, if policy makers had focused only on the accessible, low funding resources, the hydro electricity production would have been higher now. The achievement success is higher in goals based on sound reasoning and grounds rather than idealistic goal. \n Furthermore, if any politician is obsessed with their grandiose plan and policy, then it will prompt many suffering to citizen. if a country, for example, where higher power personnel wants to increase their military power despite poor economic condition of country, then the citizen will suffer from dire fate. They have to pay higher tax, other facilities such as health, education-character for promoting quality of life- are focused insignificantly by government. Because it is supposed that North Korea spends large amount of budget in military personnel, we heard about suffering of many north- Korean people. Similarly, During the construction of Taaj-mahal, which was a grandiose plan, requiring enormous amount of capital and took 30 years for completion, most citizen had to pay high taxes, gave higher portion of harvest, causing them to live a miserable life. It also emptied the state money and subverted defensive power, thus making country vulnerable to attack and other havoc in country. \n However, some may argue that quixotic goals are example of something unachievable, making the people believe that everything is possible. However, to achieve such goals, insurmountable of resources are required, so such aim are barely successful. If we compare successfulness between goal achieved on reasonable grounds and ideal grounds, then measure of grounds based aim are much higher than the latter. Therefore, for the rapid development of any country, society or community, policy maker should focus on reasonable grounds. \n In conclusion, quixotic goals can hardly be achieved, obscures basic need of people, causing them to live in tribulation, but reasoned based goals aid in developing of the country as it has high success rate.

Here's some feedback to help improve the essay:

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay addresses the topic by discussing the effectiveness of policies grounded in realism versus idealism. However, the position or viewpoint of the author is not stated early on. For improved clarity and structure, state your stance clearly in the introduction after paraphrasing the topic for discussion. 

2. **Introduction of the Essay:** It's essential to start your essay with a clear title that reflects your stance or the aspect of the topic you wish to discuss. This not only helps to guide your reader but also sets the stage for your argument.

3. **Spelling and Grammar:** Pay attention to the correct use of terms; for instance, ""reach"" should have been ""rich"" when referring to Nepal's hydro resources. Misuse of words can confuse readers or alter the intended meaning. Also, watch out for singular and plural noun agreements (""Policy, which alleviates...are necessary"" should be ""Policies, which alleviate...are necessary""). 

4. **Clarity and Coherence:** The essay sometimes struggles with clarity. Break down complex sentences into simpler ones to ensure your readers easily understand your points. 

5. **Arguments and Supporting Details:** The essay provides examples (Nepal's hydro resources, North Korea, Taj Mahal) to support the argument that realistic, attainable goals lead to better outcomes for a country. This is a strength. It's beneficial to further explore these examples by clearly linking them back to your main argument, explaining how they illustrate the benefits of pragmatism over idealism.

6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion does well to summarize the main argument. Enhancing this by restating the importance of clarity in policy goals and the implications for societal welfare based on your examples could make a stronger impact.

7. **Consistency in Point of View:** Keeping a consistent point of view throughout the essay strengthens your argument. Make sure the essay maintains a formal tone and an academic style.

8. **Vocabulary and Style:** While the use of sophisticated vocabulary can enhance an essay, ensure the words used accurately convey the intended meaning. Opt for simplicity over complexity where it aids understanding.

To improve, consider revising the essay with these points in mind. Clearly state your position early on, improve grammatical accuracy, simplify complex sentences, and ensure your arguments are directly linked to supporting evidence.

We can tell of their importance in the example of self-manufacturing businesses rather than importing from big companies which find the benefit of it in every deal. \n Factories in fact are way more significant, and it is clear that the part the factories contribute with to help solve the unemployment issue is undeniable. The best example in light of this issue is; the foreign companies which set up successful production businesses creating more jobs to help thousands of thousands of people. As a result, the economic growth rises, and so the country's situation improves to flourish. \n In spite of the positives the factories come with, they could pose a big problem to society just as would the stadiums do with the unreasonable, extravagant investments. So the factories are indeed pollutants, they cause a huge environmental pollution problem by acidifying rain, chemical spills and disposal of toxic waste. A one example explains it, is of the greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels which terribly is the source of the pollution harming. \n It has been shown that the factories' contribution to society is more worthy as opposed to the stadiums which do not come with much to society.

Therefore, it does not accurately deliver the pertinent information necessary to consider your paraphrasing complete. It should be at least 3 sentences long to be considered even remotely a complete restatement of the prompt. You only have one sentence. The problem with that statement is obvious. \n Watch your punctuation. Do not use etc. and ellipses in formal and academic writing. That is a violation of writing etiquette and shows a lack of professionalism on your part. If you must, mention 3 related points and then end the sentence.

By including it in the discussion of the warehouses, you did not really give the reader a chance to get to know the other side of the argument. Thus creating a lopsided discussion that was more slanted towards your chosen position. This does not allow the reader an educated opportunity to decide which side he would like to support. \n Basically, the essay could have been better developed and presented.

However, there are several areas that could be improved to make this essay stronger and more persuasive.

Firstly, it is essential to fully present the topic at the beginning of the essay to ensure readers understand the context and scope of the discussion. A more thorough introduction, ideally three sentences long, could effectively set the stage for the arguments that follow. This will help in clearly stating the prompt and your stance towards it.

Regarding style and grammar, the use of informal elements such as ""etc...)"" and ellipses (...) is not suitable for formal academic writing. Instead of using ""etc."", it's better to list three specific examples that support your statement and conclude the sentence. This approach will enhance the professionalism of your writing. Additionally, there's a misplaced parenthesis in the second paragraph that disrupts the flow. Proofreading and editing are critical habits to develop, as they help avoid these mistakes and improve the clarity of your message.

The organization of the essay could also be improved. The argument concerning the lesser need for stadiums would benefit from being developed in its own paragraph. This separation would provide a clearer comparison and allow readers to fully understand each side of the debate without mixing the arguments for factories and against stadiums. Such structure aids in presenting a balanced discussion, giving readers the information needed to form their own opinions.

In terms of content, while your position in favor of factories is clear and supported by examples, including environmental concerns associated with factories and comparing the societal contributions more directly with those of stadiums could further strengthen your argument. Highlighting both the advantages and disadvantages of each can provide a more rounded perspective and demonstrate critical thinking.

To improve your essay:
- Expand the introduction to fully present the topic.
- Avoid informal language and punctuation in formal essays.
- Separate your arguments into distinct paragraphs for clarity.
- Include both pros and cons of factories and stadiums to present a balanced view.
- Proofread your essay to correct grammatical errors and enhance coherence.

These are a handful of concerns of every country that I have listed but the actual list is endless.

The farmers are committing suicide because their crops are destroyed due to natural calamities and their inability to repay the loans which in turn has resulted in the scarcity of food and rise in the prices. Causes of malnutrition and starvation is a big issue that the government should look into. The government should spend some of the money from their treasury to make sure that all families should be able to afford the basic bread and butter for their survival. The government should also offer subsidies and offer loans with low interests. \n We the citizens of the country are paying taxes for the betterment of the nation. We want and demand better roads and transportation facilities, best medical facilities and social security.

The government should take up initiatives and give insurance to the medical department of the country to serve the hundreds of people who are unable to pay for their treatment. Free education should be granted and qualified teachers should be enrolled in government schools to teach the students who would grow up to be successful and independent pupils.

Spending on the space program is a risk because it takes years to research and it consumes a lot of money with no guaranteed results.

It would be unfair of me to review, analyze, and judge you based on a topic that will never show up in the actual CBEST test. You can use sites like fullexams.com to get a wide array of past CBEST essay prompts for your use during your review period. Focus on the analytical part because that is where your problem is. Don't focus so much on the personal narrative because that is your strong suit. The analytical portion requires you to be familiar with various current and past events which are post historic and / or popular in presentation. Try to brush up on your current events just in case something from the recent news events turns out to be the analytical situation prompt.","Your essay passionately argues for prioritizing domestic social issues over governmental spending on space programs. Your primary perspective is clear, advocating for resources to be allocated toward solving immediate societal problems such as homelessness, malnutrition, and lack of education and healthcare before investing in space exploration. This is a commendable attempt at addressing a complex issue. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your argument more persuasive and appropriate for an English proficiency essay test.

1. **Relevance to Topic**: It's essential to ensure that your essay directly responds to the given prompt. While your argument is well-articulated, focusing on the specific requirements of the essay prompts, such as situational analysis or personal experience narrative (if applicable), would better demonstrate your understanding and application of the instructions. Ensure the topic you choose aligns with the expected criteria.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Your essay exhibits a generally good command of language, but there are areas where spelling, grammatical, and stylistic improvements could enhance clarity and flow. For instance, avoid repetitions such as ""who-who"" and ensure proper usage of terms (""malnutritioned"" should be ""malnourished""). Additionally, maintaining consistent tense and improving sentence structure can contribute to a more polished and professional presentation.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is detectable throughout the essay; however, it could be made more evident by frequently summarizing your stance and ensuring each paragraph directly supports your argument. This clarity can be achieved by starting each paragraph with a topic sentence that directly relates to your thesis, thus reinforcing your perspective.

4. **Support for Arguments**: Your essay includes examples to back your stance but lacks depth in critical examination and connection between these examples and the overarching argument. It would be beneficial to delve deeper into how exactly diverting funds from space programs to social issues would manifest in practical benefits. Including statistics, studies, or historical precedents could further strengthen your argument. Additionally, acknowledging potential counterarguments and offering rebuttals could demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.

Improving on these areas can transform your essay from a passionate plea into a compelling, well-structured argument. Remember, the quality of your argument can significantly impact its persuasiveness. Lastly, familiarize yourself with various types of essay prompts and practice writing to different prompts to enhance your adaptability and analytical skills.",3,4,4,3,3,3,1,3,4,1,Argumentative

Hence the 3 discussion paragraph requirement.","Your essay delves into an interesting debate: whether job satisfaction is more important than job stability. Here are some points to guide your future writings:

1. Topic Response: Your essay addresses the given topic by presenting your viewpoint. You've chosen a side in the debate between job satisfaction and job stability. To strengthen your essay, ensure you directly answer the topic question in your introductory paragraph and provide a clear thesis statement. This will set a focused direction for your essay.

2. Word Count: It's crucial to meet the required word count for essays, which is often a minimum of 250 words. Your essay is under this limit. Expanding your ideas and providing more detailed examples can help increase your word count while adding depth to your arguments.

3. Structure and Discussion: Regarding the structure, a balanced essay usually consists of an introduction, at least two body paragraphs discussing different perspectives or points, and a conclusion. You've focused primarily on personal opinions rather than analyzing different public viewpoints before presenting your own. A more effective structure could be:
   - Par. 1: Introduce the topic and state your thesis or main opinion.
   - Par. 2: Discuss the first perspective (e.g., job satisfaction), including public opinion and an example.
   - Par. 3: Discuss the second perspective (e.g., job stability), including a contrasting public opinion and an example.
   - Par. 4: Provide your own opinion with specific reasons and examples.
   - Par. 5: Summarize your discussion and restate your viewpoint.

4. Grammar, Spelling, and Style: There are several spelling and grammatical errors in your essay that could distract readers from your important ideas. Pay attention to verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and the use of articles (""a"", ""an"", and ""the""). Also, remember to capitalize proper nouns. Writing shorter sentences can help reduce these errors. Additionally, using transitions between ideas can make your essay flow better.

5. Clarity and Argumentation: Your point of view is generally clear, but the arguments supporting it could be more detailed and coherent. When providing examples, make sure they directly support your argument. Clarify how these examples are relevant to your main point. It's beneficial to explain why job satisfaction or stability matters in the context you're discussing.

What are the most serious problems associated with the Internet and what solutions can you suggest?","It is true that the digital revolution has fundamentally changed the way that people absorb and transfer information. This trend can have detrimental impacts on interpersonal communication skills and the cognitive growth of children , but measures can be taken by the government and parental controls to tackle this issue. \n To begin with, excessive dependence on Internet usage can exert adverse impacts on people's social life as it has diminished real-life communication between families, friends and relatives. With the advent of social platforms and an active world-wide-web connection, cyber citizens can get access to video conferences , emails and online chatroom which allow global connection without travelling. Consequently, they will be less interested in face-to-face conversations , even be gradually isolated from the society. Another problem anticipated with the over reliance on wireless connection is that it provides access to numerous inappropriate contents to its users, including children. As Internet give people a chance to easily have public voice and upload their own materials without being heavily censored before being posted, fraudulent information and negative thoughts are rife on Internet sites. As a result, many youngsters may be able to access to those dangerous sites which then will harmfully affects their psychological growth and academic performance. \n However, several viable solutions by the authorities and parents can be implemented to address the negative effects associated with the Internet. The first solution is that government can promote campaigns to raise students' awareness of the deleterious influences of using wireless network connection. These activities should be carried out in schools and universities by being incorporated extracurricular sessions related to computer training and Internet usage . Secondly, parents should consistently control the online activities of their kids. With the existence of cutting-edge technology, parents can monitor and restricts their children's access to certain sites by different computer program such as TeamViewer. \n In conclusion, while depending excessively on Internet can exert serios effects on individual social intercourse and the development of youngsters, these can be combated with youth education and contrainsts implemented by parents. This is a joint effort by both the government and individuals which can hopefully address this problem and avert a future crisis related to cyber world.","<quotation>It is true that the digital revolution</quotation> \n Since you are not being asked if the statement originally made is true or false, there is no need to swear by the validity of the statement. You can skip the ""It is true"" part and just go directly to the topic restatement. That is all that is required of the presentation anyway. Just 3 sentences covering: \n - The restated topic \n - the problems associated \n - Possible solutions related to the problem \n Such a discussion should not take more than 3 sentences to present your restatement + question responses.

Rather, you may refer to them as parentage or paternities. Individuals basically means people, and people, do not really care about how the internet affects children, unless they are the parents of the children.","The essay provides a thoughtful exploration of how the digital revolution impacts interpersonal communication and the cognitive development of childhood, offering solutions to mitigate these effects. However, there are several areas where improvement could further enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to the topic.

1. **Introduction and Topic Response**: The essay begins with a broad acknowledgment of the digital revolution's impact. Instead of validating the given statement with ""It is true,"" dive directly into restating the topic. Concisely summarizing the issue and potential solutions in three sentences will make your introduction more effective. This approach avoids unnecessary restatements and focuses squarely on the issues and solutions related to the digital revolution's impact on communication and cognition.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Pay attention to spelling and grammar. For instance, ""contrainsts"" should be ""constraints."" Such errors can detract from the essay's overall clarity. Also, consider your word choices carefully. Referring to parents as ""parentage"" or using a more specific term rather than ""individuals"" will clarify your arguments. Remember, precise language leads to clearer communication of your ideas.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Your arguments are structured well, demonstrating how excessive internet use can negatively affect social interactions and children's psychological growth. The solutions proposed, involving both government and parental actions, show a clear understanding and perspective on the issue. Enhancing this clarity with more precise language and correcting spelling mistakes will strengthen your essay's persuasive power.

4. **Argumentation and Support**: The essay successfully details the problems arising from digital overuse and offers practical solutions. To strengthen your argument, ensure that each point is supported by specific examples or further explanation. For instance, when discussing the adverse effects of the internet on children, citing studies or specific incidents could bolster your argument's impact.

In conclusion, while your essay is well-structured and tackles the topic from a clear perspective, focusing on a more direct introduction, refining language use, and correcting spelling and grammar mistakes will significantly enhance the effectiveness and coherence of your argument.

In my view, I consider it to be a positive development. \n Similar products the world over have some drawbacks for various reasons. Many items are considered as special things in a country, and the globalization of products can lead to the loss of uniqueness in each nation. To give one example, tokbokki is a well-known traditional Korean dish. However, today, rice cake, which is a main raw material in this meal is ubiquitous in Korean marts from every corner of the world. One possible consequence of this trend would be that tourists become disillusioned with travelling to Korea just the same as the place where they are living. \n Despite the negatives mentioned above, I believe that the spread of multinational products can be seen as progress. To begin with, consumers would feel more comfortable and convenient as they can easily purchase something in foreign countries. Furthermore, this development contributes significantly to a thriving economy in the countries. People turn to buying the new brand from overseas nations, perhaps thinking it more glamorous than the one they are used to. As a result, local companies are likely to maximize their profits as they import foreign products. \n On the whole, while there are largely detrimental effects resulting from the uniformity of objects in the world, it seems to me that these developments are desirable, and all people are entitled to have access to the same products.","Dear student, you still have not learned how to analyze the discussion requirements of the essay. In an ""or"" essay, only one side of the issue to be discussed. That is the side that you support or do not support. This is not a comparison essay, this is a single opinion essay discussion. Another problem with your essay is the wrong formatting of your opening statement. You are not allowed to present your opinion in the opening statement because that is only the summary and outline of the discussion. It is not the discussion itself. Since you cannot develop your explanations within the opening statement, it is best to save that for the body of the essay. An example of the correct prompt paraphrase is: \n <em>Globalization is allowing people to buy the same products regardless of where they are in the world. The trend has seen people of the world becoming far too similar in many ways due to the ready availability of similar goods. While others think this is a negative thing, this essay will look into the positive effects of this trend.<br/><br/>I believe that this is a positive development because...</em> \n Remember, all opening and closing paragraphs need to have at least 3 sentences and represent a presentation of the discussion in paraphrased form each time. Your conclusion did not accomplish this properly. The conclusion should have just offered a summary of the discussion, data, and your opinion. \n Basically, your essay should have indicated only the positive aspects because that is what you are supporting. The negatives should have only been mentioned if you were supporting the negative side. This is a one opinion essay. You can justify your opinion using one or 2 paragraphs of reasons to strengthen your discussion.","Your essay addresses an interesting topic – the impact of globalization on the uniqueness of countries due to the widespread availability of the same products. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the quality of your essay and better meet the essay requirements.

1. **Understanding the Essay Requirements:** The essay prompt asks for a discussion on one side of an issue – either in support or against. It's important to stick to one perspective throughout your essay. While you've attempted to present both sides of the argument, focusing solely on the positive aspects, as you initially stated your agreement with, would make your argument stronger and more aligned with the essay's instructions.

2. **Essay Structure and Presentation:** The opening statement of your essay should outline the topic without stating your personal opinion. Instead of immediately presenting your view, summarize the discussion topic. For instance, you might begin with something like, ""Globalization has led to a widespread availability of similar products worldwide, influencing cultures and economies."" Save your opinion and reasons for the body paragraphs. Also, ensure that your introduction and conclusion contain at least three sentences to adequately set up and summarize your discussion and viewpoint.

3. **Developing Your Arguments:** Your essay would benefit from a focused development of your supporting arguments. Since you believe the phenomenon to be positive, concentrate on explaining and supporting this viewpoint throughout your essay. Mentioning the negative aspects only briefly, if at all, will help maintain the focus on the positive side that you're advocating for.

4. **Grammar, Spelling, and Stylistic Issues:** Generally, your essay is well-written, but there are a few areas where clarity could be improved. For example, consider revising phrases like ""Many items are considered as special things in a country"" to something more specific, such as ""Many items hold unique cultural significance within their countries."" Pay attention to the flow of your arguments to ensure a smooth progression of ideas.

5. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** Your point of view is somewhat clear but gets diluted by the presentation of contrasting views. Strengthen your stance by consistently advocating for the positive developments brought about by the global spread of products, as this is the position you've chosen to support.

6. **Descriptive and Clear Arguments:** While you have provided examples and arguments, there is room to make these clearer and more compelling. Use specific examples, data, or studies to back up your claims. Explaining how the global availability of products contributes to economic growth and consumer convenience in more depth will make your arguments more persuasive.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly improve your essay.

4099,https://essayforum.com/writing/children-learn-another-language-primary-94641/,test,IELTS 2 - should children learn another language at primary school rather than in the middle school?,"Some professionals today think youngsters should learn another language since they are at primary school rather than middle school. I firmly believe this trend has more advantages than disadvantages. \n First and foremost, thanks to learning a new language since they are just a kid can lay a foundation for their future later as having mastered various languages. It is proved that children from 5 to 12 have the ability to pick up vocabulary and mimic the pronunciation much easier while adolescents and even adults still stumble and find it difficult. In addition to this viewpoint, provided that primary students have already got a considerable amount of knowledge in English for instance, they can save time and may not have to put too much effort into it, in lieu of that, they can concentrate more on other academic subjects. As a result, students can score success, which would be fundamental for kids' success in the coming few years. A prime example of this is schools in Viet Nam, the government put English as a compulsory subject in the primary curriculum to develop the future owner of the country will not struggle to find a job when growing up. \n On the other hand, a minority of kids can consider learning a foreign language might be a burden. As they are not mature enough to perceive the depth of a language and keep repeating those words without any eagerness. Consequently, this method can turn out to be a time-consuming process and create spite in their mind. Moreover, children at that age may even not understand all the words in their mother tongue, so it can be an airy pressure. \n To manipulate, I will lean forward the advantages of learning a different language. However, parents and teachers also have to direct their kids effectively with a suitable approach.","The main problem of this essay is located in the reasoning paragraphs. You have over written and compressed the information that supports your opinion in the first reasoning paragraph.

By compressing one paragraph, the contradicting your own opinion in the next paragraph, you have left the examiner no choice but to give you a low score since your response format was incorrect and, your supporting reasons were under developed. This is a shame because, had you focused on presenting the information that affirms your opinion, you would have received a very good, higher than average passing score.","Your essay provides an insightful perspective on the importance of starting foreign language education in primary school rather than in middle school. However, there are several areas for improvement that can enhance the effectiveness and clarity of your argument.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay addresses the topic but could benefit from a more structured approach. Instead of consolidating your argument in one paragraph, it's pivotal to distribute your points across at least two paragraphs. This will ensure a clearer presentation of your supportive evidence and reasoning. You mentioned both the advantages and a disadvantage of early language learning. For a more persuasive essay, expand each point in separate paragraphs to thoroughly develop your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors that could be refined. For instance, consider changing ""since they are at primary school"" to ""starting in primary school"" for clarity. Also, ""schools in Viet Nam"" might be more commonly written as ""schools in Vietnam"". Paying attention to these details can significantly improve the readability of your essay. Additionally, using simpler sentences might help clarify your points, making the essay more accessible to readers.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your stance on the topic is clear; you support starting language learning early. Enhancing the structure of your essay, as suggested, will further solidify your viewpoint, making it easier for the reader to follow and understand.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay is rich in arguments supporting the early learning of a foreign language, like the enhanced ability of young children to learn new vocabulary and mimic pronunciations. However, your arguments require more development. Instead of compressing your supporting evidence into one paragraph, distribute it across multiple paragraphs. Each paragraph should explore a single point in depth. For example, you could dedicate one paragraph to the cognitive advantages of early language learning and another to societal and future career benefits. Avoiding the contradiction of your own points will strengthen your essay. For the disadvantage mentioned, ensure it's clearly framed as a counterpoint rather than weakening your argument.

5. **Recommendation for Improvement**: Reflect on the structure of your essay. Introduce your argument, support it with well-developed reasons in separate paragraphs, and conclude with a summary of your viewpoint and the implications of early language learning. By doing so, you will make a stronger, more convincing case.

Remember, the clarity of your argument and the structures of your essay are just as important as the points you are making.

Receiving feedback from students is one of the best way to enhance the education system. However, I am against the idea that young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during the class time. This could lead to unwanted consequences and we should consider other way to transform the classroom environment for the better result. \n First of all, allowing children to criticize their teacher in the class might affect the quality of the lesson. For example, criticism from the students might take considerable time for studying and learning objectives of that lesson might not be reached in such limited time. Other students who might not be interested in the subject would lose their attention for the lesson. Hence, this notion though innovative but not very much applicable in a normal classroom. \n Besides, in order to improve the quality of education system, we could extend the time of a normal lesson. This time should be used only to receive students opinions and queries, either in the means of feedback form or conversation. This way, the teacher would be able to understand the students confusion and response immediately or privately if necessary. This solution would give students a chance to raise their voice without wasting the time of the class. \n In conclusion, letting the teachers be freely critisized is not an effective way to improve teaching. Instead, we should have a separate time right after the lesson for students to raise their opinions. I believe this is a way to ensure the amount of knowledge taken in in a lesson and still, improve the education system.","Dear student, when writing the prompt paraphrase, you must never repeat any word or phrase from the original. So, rather than saying "" students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during the class time"", you should have indicated; ""class time should not be used to point out problems with the teaching method of an educator"" or something similar. Change the whole presentation of the fact, don't just change a small portion, that is how you will lose points because it will appear that you are not capable of expressing yourself in English in a manner that is similar to the original. That similar to the original is the whole point of the opening paraphrase. That is how the extent of your English vocabulary is first tested and in this case, you did not do a very good job at proving you have a good lexical resource for synonym words. \n Let me be clear though, your essay is still strong. Though faulty in terms of grammar and sentence structure, you were able to get your message across to the reader without causing too much confusion. You were still easily understood so you should get a decent, but maybe not very high, score for the GRA section. your C&C needs some work in terms of working in the transition sentences. If you can develop transition sentences between paragraphs, then your essay will be considered more cohesive in presentation though a bit problematic in terms of coherence.","The essay makes a strong point about the role of education systems in country development and the importance of improving them. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make the essay more impactful and clearer. 

Firstly, the essay addresses the topic by arguing against students openly criticizing teachers during class. It's important, though, to make sure that the introduction of such ideas doesn't just reword the original prompt but instead uses entirely different language and structure to present the argument. This demonstrates vocabulary range and understanding.

While the essay is strong in sharing a clear point of view, spelling and grammatical mistakes can distract readers from the message. For example, ""best way"" should be ""best ways,"" and ""critisized"" should be spelled as ""criticized."" Paying attention to these details can greatly improve the readability of the essay.

Regarding the clarity of the arguments, the essay does well in explaining why allowing criticism during class could be problematic, such as disrupting the lesson or wasting time. However, the arguments would benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs to help the essay flow more logically from one point to the next. Using phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Moreover"" at the beginning of paragraphs could enhance this aspect.

The suggestion to dedicate time after lessons for feedback is good because it provides a clear and practical solution. However, expanding the reasoning behind why this method is preferable, and possibly comparing it to other methods, could strengthen the argument further.

In summary, focusing on diversifying vocabulary without repeating phrases from the prompt, correcting spelling and grammatical errors, ensuring smoother transitions between points, and further expanding on proposed solutions will not only make the essay more cohesive and coherent but also more persuasive and engaging. These improvements will undoubtedly enhance the overall quality of the essay and better convey the message to the reader.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

The primary concern about this is cellphone usage, as a learning tool, could be generally misused by students. While a text or message pops up through the lesson, most students can't resist the urge to check their phones immediately. Meanwhile, distractions arise when students are juggling multitasking. In fact, a study has shown that engaging in multitasking during courses adversely affected the absorption of new things (Chen & Yan, 2016). Without a solid comprehension of learning, the second threat for cellphone usage in the class has serious consequences when it comes to poor academic performance. According to a recent study in Educational Psychology, students with cellphones in the class scored 5% lower on exams than those who weren't (Glass et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the effect of cellphone misusing behaviors is more than personal issues. Teachers often battle with students' devices while delivering lectures. If one's cellphone keeps ringing in the class, the teacher must force the student to turn off the device, which interrupts the whole class as well as tends to break the classroom discipline. To sum up, using cellphones in the class may sometimes bring the convenience, but once you scrutinize the drawbacks of cellphone usage, there is no doubt that it outweighs the advantages.","I am not sure about how to approach the review for this statement. Is it in response to an IELTS Task 2 essay prompt? Was this written as an English writing exercise? Perhaps as a short research paper? I am not sure about the purpose for the writing, which is making it difficult for me to assess your work. Based on the content, I will review this as a short research paper instead. Since you referred to paraphrased sources in the essay, that is the most logical review to use. \n The research itself is too short to be an effective look at the results of allowing cellphone usage in the classrooms. The premise is not thoroughly developed and the thesis statement presentation needs work. The overall presentation is not well explained either. Simply including citation sources in the presentation, but not including an expanded discussion or opinion within the presentation prevents the essay from being truly informative and showing that you actually took the time to analyze the data presentation. \n The presentation needs to be divided into paragraphs in order to give the reader a real sense of the discussion being presented. It would have also allowed you to present a more detailed explanation, opinion, and a variety of citation styles within the paper. All of which could have added to the clarity and quality of the discussion presentation. Based on the provided information, I feel like this essay could have been better developed over 5 paragraphs instead of one compressed statement.","The essay tackles an important subject: the impact of using cellphones in class. It presents three negative consequences of cellphone use, referencing studies to support these claims. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the essay's clarity, coherence, and depth.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The essay addresses the topic well by outlining the negative impacts of cellphone use in class. It’s clear that the topic is understood and directly addressed.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   There are no major spelling or grammatical errors, which is positive. However, the essay's style could be improved. The information is presented in a single paragraph, making it difficult for readers to distinguish between different points. Breaking the essay into multiple paragraphs would help organize the content, making it easier for readers to follow the argument.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
   The point of view is clear: cellphone usage in class has more disadvantages than advantages. However, this stance could be further strengthened by providing a more detailed analysis and including personal opinions or reflections on the presented studies.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   The essay provides evidence from studies to support its claims, which is commendable. Nonetheless, the discussion around these studies is quite brief. Expanding on how these findings directly support the essay’s thesis could deepen the reader's understanding of the issue. It might also benefit from discussing a wider variety of sources or presenting counterarguments to create a more balanced view.

**Additional Suggestions:**
- **Thesis Statement:** A more explicit thesis statement at the beginning could serve as a clear roadmap for the essay. It would help readers understand the primary focus and the arguments that will be discussed.
- **Development of Points:** More detailed explanations and examples would enrich the essay's content. Each point mentioned could be discussed in its own paragraph, allowing for a thorough exploration of why cellphone use in class is detrimental.
- **Inclusion of Personal Opinion:** Integrating personal insights or interpretations of the data could make the essay more engaging and show a deeper level of analysis.
- **Paragraph Structure:** Adopting a five-paragraph structure might be beneficial. This structure could include an introduction, three paragraphs for each argument, and a conclusion summarizing the essay's main points and restating the thesis in light of the arguments presented.

By addressing these areas, the essay could become more informative, persuasive, and enjoyable to read. Remember, the goal is not just to present facts but to analyze them and convey a compelling argument to the reader.",4,4,2,4,1,2,3,4,2,1,Argumentative

I feel this way basically for two reasons that I will explore on the following essay. \n To begin with, playing videogames can develop one\'s overall knowledge and culture, which are two things kids seeks but are difficult to achieve in some more traditional and passive manner like books or classes. On a more engaging and interactive scenario, computer games have a much more appealing approach and can be a much more easy and pleasurable way to teach the often curious mind of a children. My own experience is a good example of this. When I was very young, I already played a lot of videogames. In the beginning it was only some actions to repeat and buttons to press. But as the games was evolving and I was getting older, they began to have more complex design and often you would had to read and listen to english instructions to complete a given task or even understand the whole story. On that sense, I've got my first english classes while trying to complete some games. It is incredible how I was motivated to finish a virtual game that also brought an curiosity and determination to understand another language and increase on my overall culture and knowledge. \n Furthermore, while purposing new situations and challenge, a game could train and improve a person's cognitive system, which a children can profit in a more relevant way. Nowadays games are being used in many more forms than just entertainment. It is used in a school to help children with math, in a job interview to help evaluate candidate's logical capability and in some services to help train users' cognitive memory. As I said above, I played a lot of videogames in my young age. In that matter, it helped me with logical puzzles and decision making situations. Also, it can help you train your mind into stressful situations while you play your way through some timed tasks. It can assist the development of those skills in any gamer but children would most benefit from this since their brains are more susceptible for learning new abilities. \n In conclusion, I strongly think computer games are not waist of time, specially for children. This is because it can help improve one's culture and knowledge and it can improve people's cognitive system.","Dear student, please post the complete prompt for this essay discussion. The prompt must always accompany all of your future essay postings if you want us to be able to give you an accurate and thorough review of your work. There are 4 considerations in scoring your essay that will be based upon your ability to respond to the prompt instructions. Right now, I will unable to score those sections as I do not know what the prompt expects you to present in your response essay. \n Overall though, you have some grammar structure errors such as having a slash sign along with an apostrophe S. It is important that you review your work for punctuation errors before submission so that you can have a better score in the grammar accuracy range of the scoring considerations. That also goes for the way that you spell words. I think you meant to say ""branch"" instead of ""brach"" right? You also need to know the difference between words. Just because the word sounds the same when pronounced does not mean that the word you spelled is the one to be used in the sentence. You should have said ""waste"" of time, not ""waist"". The waist is a body part while waste means ""use or expend carelessly, extravagantly, or to no purpose."" If you are unsure about the way to use a word, and you know how to spell it, look up the meaning first. Don't just use the word because, when used in the wrong manner in a sentence, this will result in a lower lexical score for yourself. \n The rest of the discussion seems to be alright. Again, I am making that judgement without knowing what the actual discussion type and information requirement of your essay is. I can offer a better insight into your work once you post the complete prompt here.","Your essay makes an interesting claim that playing computer games can be beneficial, especially for children, in terms of developing knowledge, culture, and cognitive abilities. While your enthusiasm for the subject shines through, there are several areas where you can improve your essay to make your argument stronger and your writing clearer.

1. **Topic Response:** Without the original prompt, it's challenging to assess how well your essay answers the question. For future essays, always include the prompt. This ensures that your essay remains focused and directly addresses the topic.

2. **Grammar and Spelling:** Pay close attention to your use of punctuation and spelling. For instance, ""it's"" with an apostrophe is short for ""it is"" or ""it has,"" which seems not to fit your intended meaning. Also, watch for typographical errors, such as ""brach,"" which should be ""branch,"" and ensure you're using the correct words in the correct context (e.g., ""waste"" not ""waist""). These mistakes can distract readers and make your writing appear less polished.

3. **Clarity and Style:** Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Introduce your arguments more distinctly and support them with specific examples. Try to use simpler language to make your essay more accessible to all readers, remembering that clear and straightforward language often has the most significant impact.

4. **Arguments and Evidence:** You've provided personal experiences to support your view, which is excellent. However, consider adding more varied evidence or examples from outside your experience. This might include studies, statistics, or expert opinions on how video games can be educational or improve cognitive abilities. Doing so would strengthen your argument and make your case more convincing.

5. **Point of View:** Your stance on the subject is clear, which is good. To make your argument even more compelling, consider addressing potential counterarguments and explaining why your viewpoint still holds. This shows that you've thought about the topic from multiple angles.

In conclusion, you have made a good start by advocating for the benefits of computer games. By refining your essay with the suggestions above, you can enhance its clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. Keep practicing, and don't forget to review your work for errors before submission.

From my point of view, I partly agree with this opinion and think that crude oil and green energy should be encouraged for simultaneous using. Although fossil fuels account for the vast majority of energy in most countries, it is also a double-edged sword. \n On the one hand, alternative source et energy are not always available. In some areas which have narrow terrain and different natural conditions, setting up things like wind mills or solar panels is a challenging issue for them. For examples wind energy can not be used in the country that does not have coastline like Laos. Not only that, not every government has enough finance to invest in natural power. Installing solar panels for building hydropower factory costs too much money, which can be a obstacle to people who do not have well-off wage. \n On the other hand, fossil fuels are non-renewables energy, it will run out in the foreseeable future. With current overexploitation petroleum, it likely to be exhausted soon. In addition, the factory that turns crude oil into power discharges exhaust fumes into the atmosphere, which result in greenhouse effect is and global warming. Contrast with natural energy, it do not cause pollution and environmentally friendly. In some developed county, government has introduced public transport using green energy into use widely \n On balance, crude oil make up the majority of energy for most nation but natural energy should be used instead. It seems to me that everything has two sides of it, human should use at the same time both fossil fuels and alternative source of energy for high efficiency.","The original prompt for this essay asks if you think this is a positive or negative development. Since your response is that you partly agree with the issue, the response format, as you have provided, is incorrect. You have given a measured response to the prompt when the discussion instruction / question does not require such an answer. Therefore, your TA score will start at a failing level due to your unrelated response to the prompt. Now, since you did not properly respond to the question, which is a one sided opinion discussion, the essay cannot receive a passing score. Once your response format for the TA section is incorrect, the rest of the discussion paragraphs are incorrect as well. So you cannot expect to get a passing score with this type of presentation because: \n - You failed to use the correct response format to the question; \n - Your discussion presentation uses the comparative format when the discussion requires a single opinion explanation \n - You clearly showed the examiner that you did not understand the original prompt topic, question, and discussion instruction \n We have sample essay responses to this prompt listed in the Similar Threads section. I suggest that you read those essays to gain a better understanding of how to approach this type of prompt question.","The essay does initiate a discussion on the importance of both fossil fuels and green energy as sources of energy, attempting to balance the benefits and drawbacks of each. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to effectively address the essay prompt and enhance overall clarity and quality.

1. **Response to the Essay Topic**: The essay does not fully adhere to the prompt's requirements. The prompt asks for a position on whether the development is positive or negative, yet the essay presents a mixed viewpoint without directly addressing the prompt's demand for a clear stance. It's essential to closely read and respond directly to what the essay question is asking. A focused response that clearly chooses one side or provides a structured argument based on the prompt's specific requirements would be more appropriate.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that detract from its overall clarity and effectiveness. For example, phrases like ""government lean towards the view point"" and ""green energy should be used substitute"" are grammatically incorrect and confusing. Consistent verb tense, proper spelling, and clearer sentence structures would significantly improve readability. It is also advisable to use simpler and more precise language to make the argument more accessible, especially considering this is intended for English language learner students.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay's point of view is somewhat unclear due to its attempt to argue both sides of the issue without a definitive stance. For a clearer point of view, decisively argue for one side of the debate while acknowledging the other. This will not only respond directly to the prompt but also provide your essay with a more persuasive and coherent argument structure.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay attempts to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of fossil fuels and green energy. However, the arguments would benefit from being more focused and supported by specific examples or data. For instance, when mentioning the challenges of setting up renewable energy sources, providing concrete examples or statistics could strengthen the argument. Similarly, discussing the environmental impact of fossil fuels in more detail could provide a stronger basis for the essay's viewpoint.

To improve, closely adhere to the essay prompt, refine spelling and grammar, clarify the essay's stance, and bolster arguments with specific, focused examples or data. Reading sample essays, as suggested, could offer insights into effectively structuring and presenting arguments within the confines of the prompt's requirements.

What can be done to solve?,"Recent decades have witnessed the increasing numbers of the elderly population. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons of the trend and its solutions. \n In term of the causes of the proliferation of retired residents, this situation can bring numerous disadvantages. One of the discernible problems is putting a heavy strain on medical services in public sector. No doubt, when employees devote the whole of their working years in the companies, they can be highly suffered from several aging health conditions while there are minimize number of individuals who involved in health insurance. Therefore, this will lead to the government have to invest extensive money in order to serve these people. Another problem is preventing their children from earning money. Indeed, in some developing countries, the private care for aged population have certain limitation and offer an extensive price. Consequently, the retired population's children have to look after parents by themselves. \n Regarding to tacking the problems of this trend, I believe that the government should encourage individuals to involve in health insurance when they enter the workforce. From this approach, the government can collect minimize money from their monthly salaries, which can be saved and spent if they need to receive health service in the later life. Consequently, the local authorities can invest those money on other priority areas, such as: education or technology. Furthermore, the governments can release a public health service with reasonable price in order to help citizens to take care for elderly people at home therefore ambitious employees can devote extensive time on their workloads. As a result, the government can receive an enormous money of taxation from economic activities. \n In conclusion, I think that the increasing number of the aged population can cause several drawbacks because of putting a heavily burden on public health service and their children to look after them. However, I believe that the optimal approaches to solve this problem is the governments should increase the number of health insurance participants and provide an ""at home"" health service.","You are not following the expected writing requirements for this type of essay.

Here's how it can be improved for clarity, coherence, and alignment with English proficiency test expectations:

1. **Topic Response and Structure**: The essay topic is recognized; however, the approach to addressing it can be enhanced. A more direct statement of the writer's opinion would strengthen the introduction. Instead of simply stating the essay will discuss reasons and solutions, explicitly present your viewpoint. For example, ""I argue that the rise in the elderly population strains public resources, but implementing compulsory health insurance and accessible home care services can mitigate these effects.""

2. **Word Count and Task Fulfillment**: Keeping your essay within the suggested word limit for Task 2 essays (usually around 250-300 words for English proficiency tests) is crucial. Conciseness ensures you directly answer the essay question without unnecessary information. Aim for brevity and relevance in each paragraph.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several grammatical and stylistic issues to address:
    - Spelling and grammar corrections: Change ""in term of"" to ""in terms of,"" ""suffered from"" to ""suffer,"" ""minimize number"" to ""minimal number,"" and ""those money"" to ""that money.""
    - Consistency in terminology will help, such as choosing either ""elderly population,"" ""aged population,"" or ""retired residents,"" and using it throughout the essay.
    - Simplify complex sentences and ensure verb tense consistency to improve readability.

4. **Clarity of Opinion**: The essay mentions problems and solutions but doesn’t clearly state the author’s personal stance until the conclusion. Make your opinion clear from the beginning and reinforce it throughout the essay, especially in the conclusion.

5. **Argument Support**: While two main issues are identified, their explanations can be clearer. Instead of broadly mentioning the burden on public health services and personal care by children, detail how these are significant problems—with statistics or examples—and how your proposed solutions effectively address them.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should succinctly summarize the key points made and reiterate your viewpoint. Ensure it feels like a closing argument, reinforcing the solutions proposed rather than introducing new ideas.

Imported or local?,"Nowadays, consumers are more likely to make a food products from foreign countries choice than domestic ones. While there are various reasons for this trend, some initiatives could be taken to increase buyer's demand for local food. \n There are two mains reasons, in my opinion, why an increasing number of people tend to purchasing food imports. Firstly, the development of international trade has become easier for purchasers to access to foreign food products. As a result, they can choose between several products and find the one they like the most. Secondly, consumers would prefer purchasing food imports because of their quality. When foods are being imported, their quality is always checked an \n d only the best products end up on the globe market so this would help the buyers could believe in quality of imported food. In Vietnam, for example, importing agricultural products must undergo testing and also include expiration dates, and food safety standards. \n The government should take some measures to boosting the consumption of domestic commodities effectively. The first solution is that government could impose a higher tax on the importation to reduce the demand. By raising tax, people's pockets are affected directly, thus they would increase their desire for more indigenous food. On an individual level, food manufacturing companies should assure their consumption of food that is higher for fresh, natural and organic products. In other words, if a supplier tried to sell healthier food, people would show more willingness to increase their spending on the local foods. \n In conclusion, the causes for consumers' change of preference for food are varied; and government and producers could do a lot to promote them to buy local products.","Dear student, your opening statement falls short of the examiner's expectations. You failed to properly develop the paragraph by showing a clear paraphrasing of the prompt and the outline for the discussion. Your short, 2 sentence presentation does not effectively introduce the upcoming discussion. Next time, make sure to review the prompt requirements against your opening statement. Ensure that all of the required elements are represented properly and that the discussion outline is clear. By the way, you don't need to place a period between paragraphs. A simple line break using the enter key will be sufficient. You could lose points for misplaced punctuation marks. Just write the essay as you would normally write a paper for school. \n Your line of reasoning is appropriate and informs the reader in a proper manner.

I think you won't get higher than a 5 for this essay.","Your essay begins by addressing the topic of consumer preference for foreign food products over domestic ones, and suggests steps to enhance demand for local foods. However, here are areas for improvement to make your essay more effective:

1. **Introduction:** The introduction is crucial but your current opening could be stronger. It should clearly paraphrase the essay question and outline your arguments. To improve, aim for a more detailed introduction that includes a brief overview of the reasons behind the trend and the solutions you will explore. This helps the reader anticipate the content of your essay.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation:** There are several grammatical and punctuation errors throughout the essay that could impact your score. For example, be mindful of verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. Avoid placing a period between paragraphs; a simple line break is sufficient. Enhancing your grammar will make your arguments clearer and more persuasive.

3. **Clarity of Argument:** Your essay presents a clear point of view, arguing why consumers prefer imported food and how to encourage consumption of local produce. However, some arguments could be developed further for clarity. For instance, explain how international trade has made foreign products more accessible, and detail why this impacts consumer choice. When discussing quality, provide more examples or evidence to support your claims.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** While the essay offers reasons for consumer behavior and suggests solutions, some points require further elaboration. For example, when suggesting higher taxes on imported goods or promoting local, fresh food, explain how these measures could change consumer behavior. Providing specific examples, such as case studies or statistics, would strengthen your argument.

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion should synthesize the discussion, reiterating key points and solutions proposed. Currently, it lacks depth and specificity. A strong conclusion will summarize the reasons behind consumer preferences, restate your solutions, and reflect on the broader implications. Aim for at least three sentences to ensure your conclusion effectively wraps up the essay.

The habit once considered elegant of high-end people is now regarded as a bad habit. I completely side with people who suggest that smoking should be strictly prohibited. \n First of all, smoking is proved to have links with lung cancer and other cardiac diseases. WHO has released a report indicating that smokers have noticeable shorter life span than those who do not smoke, approximately up to ten years, as they are more likely to experience fatal illness. Moreover, people who smoke get more chances of giving birth to children with deficiencies. It should also be noticed that not only smoking affects people who smoke, passive smokers, those inhale secondhand smoke suffer as well. It is evident that the rate of non-smokers suffering from smoking-related diseases is even higher than that of smokers. \n Secondly, strict prohibition of smoking can save up a large amount of money for the government and related authorities. Many people argue that tobacco industry is one of the key contributors to the national economy, as the taxes imposed on such industry is extremely high. However, the cost that the government has to pay to proceed medical research and to address problems arising from smoking is much greater than those collected. \n In conclusion, I advocate the opinion opposing of smoking and convinced that the government should completely ban smoking due to the hazardous consequences it might bring to human's well-being, as well as the fact it would gradually hurt the national economy.","Dear student, your body paragraphs for the defense of your stance is perfect.

The first is that the opening statement does not accurately represent the prompt requirement. Here an example of a proper prompt paraphrase for this paper (make sure to follow the example for the rest of your practice papers): \n <em>Smoking is an activity that has been enjoyed by many people through the centuries. However, there has been a recent rise in the discussion as to whether smoking should be banned completely or not. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned.

The arguments presented are well-supported with references to health implications for both smokers and non-smokers, as well as the economic toll on society. These points are made within well-structured paragraphs, which showcase logical development and a cohesive presentation of ideas.

However, there are areas in need of improvement to enhance the essay's clarity and flow. Firstly, the introduction needs more precision in outlining the essay's focus and stating the author's stance clearly. An improved introduction should succinctly paraphrase the prompt, introduce the topic for discussion, and clearly state the position that the essay will argue for. This sets a clearer expectation for readers and demonstrates comprehension and analytical ability in English.

Transition sentences at the end of paragraphs could significantly improve the essay's readability, helping to weave individual sections together more seamlessly. Currently, each paragraph concludes abruptly, leading to a somewhat jarring transition to the next point. A smoother linkage between paragraphs would enhance the fluidity of discussion and maintain reader engagement.

The conclusion, as written, falls short of effectively summarizing the essay's main points and reaffirming the author's stance. A well-crafted conclusion should restate the prompt, summarize the key arguments discussed, and provide a closing remark, without introducing new information. Aim for at least three sentences to adequately conclude the discussion, providing a comprehensive closure to your essay.

Additionally, it is important to carefully review the essay for minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that can detract from the overall quality. Addressing these areas will not only improve the essay's readability but also demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency.

In summary, strengthen the introduction and conclusion for greater clarity and impact, improve transitions for smoother flow, and address any minor language errors.

From my perspective, the advantages of purchasing things on the Internet outweighs its disadvantages and some main points will be addressed in the following paragraphs. \n To begin with, the most apparent benefit of shopping online is its convenience. It cannot be denied that there is no line to wait in or cashiers to track down the purchases and you can do your shopping in minutes. Shopping online gives us the opportunity to shop 24/7, and also reward us with a ""no pollution"" shopping experience. To be more exact, there is no better place to buy informational things like e-books, which are available to you instantly, as soon as the payment goes through. Downloadable items purchased online eliminate the need for any kind of physical material at all, as well, which is more environmentally-friendly. \n Some people assert that there are several risks of fraud in online shopping such as counterfeit products, credit card scam, etc. Fortunately, many e-commerce platforms which adopt credible purchase policies, namely Shoppe, Lazada, create favourable conditions for both sellers and buyers not to worry about this problem. Furthermore, if customers purchase things online frequently on these e-commerce platforms, they will offer you several vouchers, discount coupons, rebates and free delivery. Moreover, comparing and researching products and their prices is so much easier online. If you're shopping for appliances, for example, you can find consumer reviews and product comparisons for all the options on the market, with links to the best prices. We can research firsthand experience, ratings, and reviews for most products and retailers to make a more precise decision before purchasing something. \n In conclusion, the demerits of e-commerce trends are overshadowed by the merits resulting from modern technology. I am convinced that online shopping is one of the great innovations of people doing transactions as it reduces time and provides more benefits and options.","<quotation>towards</quotation> \n Not towards.

Not a very good preliminary score. \n You must remember the discussion instruction / question: \n <quotation>DO THE ADVANTAGES OF SHOPPING IN THIS WAY OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES?</quotation> \n The problem with this presentation is that you do not really disprove that the advantage is really a disadvantage. Rather you have one paragraph explaining the advantage and one covering the disadvantage. Your formatneeds correction.

This practice actually has strong disadvantages because...<br/><br/>Then, there is the affordability of brandname products that turn out tobe counterfeit. Since the item cannot be examined online...</em> \n As you can see, the clarity of the discussion paragraph format as it aligns itself to the discussion question will increase the possibility of a higher C+C score. Something your format cannot achieve.","Your essay on the topic of online shopping and its expanding popularity as we progress in the 21st century is thorough and provides a balanced view of both the advantages and disadvantages associated with it. However, there are a few areas where improvements could greatly enhance the effectiveness and clarity of your arguments, as well as aligning more accurately with the essay prompt.

First, it's important to recognize that we are already in the 21st century. Therefore, using ""moving towards the 21st century"" could be replaced with terminology that acknowledges our current existence in this era, such as ""As we advance in the 21st century"" or simply ""In the 21st century.""

The introduction of your essay briefly mentions that the advantages of online shopping outweigh its disadvantages, but it doesn't thoroughly explain why this is your standpoint. It would strengthen your essay to directly address the prompt in your thesis statement by specifying why the advantages outweigh the disadvantages from the onset. This sets a clearer direction for your subsequent arguments.

Your essay would benefit from a more structured contrast between the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping. Presently, your discussion leans more towards listing advantages with only a brief mention of potential risks, which might not fully satisfy the prompt's requirement to explore whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Consider restructuring your essay to present each advantage with a directly related disadvantage. This comparison will not only provide a more balanced view but also allow you to critically examine if and how the positive aspects indeed overshadow the negative ones.

In terms of language and style, your essay is well-written but watch out for minor errors like ""the advantages... outweighs"" where it should be ""outweigh"" to agree with the subject. Paying careful attention to these details can improve the readability and professionalism of your work.

Furthermore, your argument about the environmental benefits of online shopping and the convenience of comparing products online is compelling. However, delving deeper into how these advantages specifically outweigh the disadvantages mentioned would enhance your argument's clarity and impact. For example, when discussing the risks of fraud, you could elaborate on how the convenience and benefits of online shopping still retain their value despite these risks.

Lastly, your conclusion effectively summarizes your stance but revisiting the prompt more explicitly here could reinforce your argument. Stating clearly how your discussion has demonstrated that the advantages of online shopping indeed outweigh the disadvantages can provide a strong, persuasive close to your essay.

By addressing these points, your essay can offer a more comprehensive, structured, and persuasive argument in response to the prompt.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

As we discussed above, there are several methods to face up to the problem of increased television viewing and decreased physical activities in today's children.","I am afraid that the writer's exaggerated form of word usage is the biggest problem with regards his writing skills. This essay sounds more like a dictionary was used for word references. The writer chose complicated sounding words and used them. Unfortunately she did not understand the meaning of the word, nor how to use it properly in a sentence. He tried too hard to impress and failed. Word usage, when done properly increases the score across all considerations. Used improperly and you end up with this failing score presentation. There is no reason for this essay to recieve a passing score in any aspect because of wrong word usage, wrong sentence structure throughout, and a lack of coherence in the thought presentations.","The essay addresses the topic of the increasing rate of youngsters watching television and its implications. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness of the message.

Firstly, the essay is somewhat responsive to the given topic, discussing the reasons behind children's increased television viewing and proposing solutions. However, the points made are not always clear or fully developed.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there's a noticeable struggle with word choice. The attempt to use sophisticated vocabulary is commendable but has resulted in several misapplications and unnatural sentence structures. For instance, phrases like ""rate of youngsters watching television amplification in a hurry"" could be simplified to ""the rapidly increasing rate of youngsters watching television."" Simplifying the language would not only make the essay more comprehensible but would also improve its overall flow. Furthermore, avoiding overly complex words without a clear understanding of their usage detracts from the message and can confuse readers.

The point of view is generally clear – there's an acknowledgment of a problem related to children's excessive television watching and a suggestion of solutions. However, this view could be presented more convincingly with structured arguments and specific examples or statistics to support claims. For instance, rather than broadly stating ""television becomes a necessary thing in almost family,"" specify how television's role has evolved culturally or technologically.

The arguments intended to support the author's position are present but not always descriptive or persuasive enough. To strengthen these arguments, focus on clarifying the cause-and-effect relationships and providing concrete examples or evidence. For example, when discussing the impact of technology or parental influence on children's television habits, including research findings or comparisons over time might add weight to the argument.

To improve, consider the following recommendations:
- Use simpler, more precise language that accurately conveys your thoughts without overcomplication.
- Structure the essay more clearly with distinct introduction, body, and conclusion sections that guide the reader through your argument.
- Provide specific examples or data to support your claims, adding credibility and depth to your arguments.
- Revise sentences for clarity and grammatical accuracy, ensuring each sentence contributes to your overall point.

In summary, streamlining the language to match the intended message, structuring the essay for clarity, and reinforcing arguments with concrete examples will significantly improve the essay. The effort to tackle a relevant and complex issue is evident, and with refinement, the presentation of ideas can become both powerful and persuasive.",4,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Government funding should reflect this. \n To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that preventing problems relevant to health is far more crucial than curing these problems. Basically, I side with this standpoint, however, the role of treatment can never be ignored. \n On the one hand, I believed that measures of avoidance are better than medicine in term of long-term benefits namely physical and mental health or economy. In general, using prevention not only help patient to avoid diseases or problems, but also enable them to reduce side-effect of drugs as well as incidental damages. Especially, operation in internal organs like brain or heart has a very high risk of disordering function of them in the future. Added to this is sense of disturbing for medicine user because vomiting and anorexia usually occur after taking pills. Furthermore, some kind of problem will require you to pay enormous expense if you are re-infected, meanwhile, vaccination has permanent effect. \n On the other hand, treatment has always been considered as an only choice when it comes to certain circumstances. Firstly, not every problem can be avoided with current technology. Taking ""Yasuo"" for example, it is known as an inborn disorder relevant to impairment of bones and the only way to prevent is fixing the original gens of human, a novel solution, therefore, studying medicine is more possible. Secondly, in fast-paced modern lifestyle, people are more incline to have poor diet and not to take periodical examination.

Therefore, the essay will fail a major part of the scoring process and most likely not be able to reach a passing score for the remaining considerations in the end.","Your essay shows thoughtful engagement with an important topic: the relative merits of prevention versus treatment in healthcare. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to more clearly communicate your ideas and better meet the task requirements. Let's go through them:

1. **Addressing the Topic:** The task asked to what extent you agree or disagree with a given statement, expecting a clear position to be taken. Your essay somewhat strays from this directive by discussing both prevention and treatment without firmly arguing for one over the other. To enhance your essay, aim to articulate a more definitive stance, supporting it with stronger, more focused arguments. If you agree that prevention is better, maintain this view throughout and use examples and explanations that reinforce this perspective.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Your essay contains several grammatical and stylistic errors that could affect clarity. For instance:
   - ""I believed"" should be ""I believe"" to maintain present tense consistency.
   - Phrasing like ""in term of"" should be ""in terms of.""
   - Avoid using slang or informal expressions such as ""Yasuo"" without explanation, as it might confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.
   Correcting these errors will greatly improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** While your personal viewpoint appears to be in favor of prevention, the inclusion of counterarguments without clear refutations muddles this stance. Strengthen your point of view by not only presenting counterarguments (the role of treatment) but also clearly explaining why, despite these, prevention remains superior in your view.

4. **Support for Your Position:** Your essay does well to bring up key points in support of prevention, such as the long-term benefits and reduced side effects. However, these arguments could be made more persuasive with specific examples and clearer explanations. For example, you could cite studies that show the cost-effectiveness of vaccines compared to treatments for the same diseases. Similarly, your points about the limitations of treatment would be stronger with data or references to specific scenarios where prevention has been proven more effective.

To summarize, your essay has the potential to effectively communicate a compelling argument for the prioritization of prevention in healthcare. By clarifying your stance, addressing the task more directly, and refining your use of language, you can enhance your essay's persuasiveness and coherence. Keep focusing on clearly structured arguments and supporting them with specific, relevant examples for the strongest impact.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4110,https://essayforum.com/writing/living-horizontal-city-probably-best-option-93038/,test,"Living in a horizontal city is probably the best option, but others tend to live in a vertical city","It is argued that living in a horizontal city is the best option, but others tend to live in a vertical city. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and why I partially favor with the latter option. \n On the one hand, the option of living in a horizontal city is beneficial in some ways. Firstly, people can pay fewer fees for building services. For instance, people do not need to spend on security services or rent. It will save a huge amount of money each month. Secondly, living or working lower to the ground helps people be saved. In some situations, like a fire, people living in high buildings can not only be in danger when they breathe in carbon dioxide but also have difficulty running out of the building. In contrast, this can be solved by a horizontal city. \n On the other hand, I believe that living or working in a high-rise building is outweighed by its advantages. There are two reasons for my perspective. One of the most important causes is that a vertical city provides more space for people to use. The population is increasing steadily every year, especially in urban areas. Hence, people do not have enough places to live or work. High buildings are a good solution to this problem. Furthermore, people can be provided various services. Indeed, people and their private stuff, like transport or accommodation facilities, can be protected by the security of the building. People can feel safe when they get out of their place, facilitating the development of life quality. \n In conclusion, it seems evident that both living or working lower to the ground and in high buildings have their own unique advantages. Personally, however, i strongly believe that living in a vertical city is way better.","Give a clear reason why you support the latter opinion in your personal point of view statement. By adding your personal reason or supporting reason, an additional clarification sentence will be provided. This adds to the strength of the first paragraph and increases the kick-off score.

The reasoning provided is incomplete in focus. The essay lacks proper topic development. This will lead to a lower than passing score since the required discussion format is not properly presented to the examiner.","The essay effectively addresses the pros and cons of living in a horizontal versus a vertical city, demonstrating an understanding of the topic. However, there are areas that could be improved to enhance clarity, completeness, and coherence.

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay attempts to discuss both perspectives before expressing a personal preference for vertical cities, it could more explicitly address the assignment's requirement for a three-part discussion, including a more detailed personal opinion. The transition between discussing the general arguments and introducing a personal viewpoint could be smoother. Directly stating personal reasons for favoring vertical living in the introduction would make the stance clearer and more compelling.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammar mistakes that can be corrected with careful proofreading. The use of lowercase ""i"" should be replaced with ""I"" to maintain formality. Stylistically, the essay would benefit from varied sentence structures and more precise vocabulary to articulate arguments more compellingly. Avoiding repetition by using synonyms would also enhance the writing style.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The essay mentions a preference for vertical city living. However, this viewpoint could be made more persuasive by providing specific, personal reasons early in the essay, as mentioned in the introduction. Adding a sentence about why this preference exists from a personal perspective would strengthen the essay's argument and engage the reader more effectively.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position**: While the essay outlines advantages and disadvantages associated with each living situation, further development of these ideas is needed. Providing at least three clear and detailed sentences for each argument, including the personal viewpoint, could offer a more robust discussion. Incorporating comparisons and contrasts between public reasoning and personal viewpoints would enrich the essay, offering a more comprehensive exploration of the topic. 

Moreover, ensure every paragraph tackles a distinct aspect of the discussion, aligning with the essay's structure requirements. In doing so, each section—from discussing benefits and drawbacks to stating a personal opinion—should be fully developed to provide a rounded and complete argument.

In conclusion, refining the structure to clearly separate personal viewpoints from general discussion, enhancing grammatical accuracy, and deepening the exploration of the subject matter with specific details and examples will significantly improve the essay's quality.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Such researches are hold up by a few, while another group is more care about animal right. This essay will discuss both the views, followed by my opinion. \n Scientists should use alternative methods of research instead of experimenting on animals. To measure the effectiveness of drugs, some animals are commonly used. These activities not only hurt them, but also cause them to die early. If animals are continuously used for this, they may extinct soon which might have adverse impact on the environment. Therefor, experiment on animals should be banned. \n However, medical science is depended on animal experimentation greatly. Even most researchers prefer animals to test new drugs as some animals' DNA is identical to humans' DNA. if using animals is stopped, such researches become impossible to carry. For this reason, experience on animals is considered as a legal activity for medicals' inventions. \n In my opinion,animals can be used only to invent new medicine which is significant impact on human's life. Indeed there is no suitable substitutes of animals to carry researches. Nonetheless, misused of animals must be prevented. In fact people need to avoid animals in producing cosmetic products. So I would say that people can use animals if it need for medical purpose. \n It is apparent that animals testing is only a way to resolve existing health issues. Also this has enormous potential to bring new inventions to new concerns. Although some are against for this, I would opine that animal experiments should not be banned for the invention of medicines.","There are 2 topics for combined discussion in this essay.

Your prompt paraphrase is also problematic as it does not really coherently present the topic for discussion and discussion instruction. If you double check your work, you will see that you also started off the essay with a lower case letter, which is a violation of English writing rules.

This oversight limits the comprehensiveness of the response, potentially affecting the overall score for task achievement. It's essential when writing an essay to ensure that all aspects of the prompt are addressed to avoid receiving a lower score in this critical assessment area.

Firstly, the essay begins with a lowercase letter which is not in accordance with English writing rules - always start sentences with a capitalized letter. Attention to such details is important for creating a good impression and adhering to standard writing conventions.

Regarding the structure and content, the essay somewhat successfully introduces the topic but struggles with coherence and clarity in the paraphrase of the prompt. This issue suggests a necessity for a clearer and more concise introduction that accurately presents the essay's discussion points. Improving the paraphrase could help in making a stronger initial impact.

The argumentation within the essay shows an effort to consider both sides of the animal testing issue, yet, the arguments would benefit from further development and support. More specific examples, clearer explanations, and a more detailed exploration of alternative research methods would enhance the essay's persuasive power. Additionally, focusing on the construction of more coherent and well-developed sentences would assist in making the arguments more compelling and easy to follow.

There are instances of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes ('therefor' should be 'therefore', 'experiments' incorrectly used as 'experience'), and vocabulary limitations that somewhat hinder the readability and professionalism of the essay. Working on grammar skills and expanding vocabulary can significantly improve the quality of writing and the effectiveness of communication.

The point of view of the author becomes clear towards the end of the essay, proposing that animal testing should be reserved for significant medical discoveries. However, a more distinct stance taken early in the essay, supported by strong, clear, and logically structured arguments, would make the position more persuasive to the reader.

In conclusion, to elevate the quality of future essays, focus on fully responding to the essay prompt, improving sentence structure and coherence, expanding vocabulary, and alleviating grammatical errors.

In my opinion, I disagree with this point of view and I think that art should receive the same fund as public services \n On the one hand, there are a myriad of reasons why the government should spend money on public services. First, public services such as public transportation reduce air pollution and congestion. The main cause of air pollution is exhaust fumes released from personal vehicles such as motorbikes and cars. Compared to cars, public transport is much eco-friendlier since less emissions are produced per passenger. Therefore, by spending money on mass transportation, the air pollution problem can be mitigated quite effectively. Besides, it also cuts down traffic jams because more people riding on buses, trains, and other public systems means there are fewer vehicles on the road to cause traffic. In addition, if the government spends money on other public services like healthcare, the health of our society can improve, thus increasing the life expectancy of our country. \n On the other hand, the investment on the art should not be neglected. Firstly, travelers from other countries come to view the ancient structures, and by spending money on preserving artistic past, a country can entice visitors to return. This approach helps the tourism industry develop prosperously. Additionally, arts can improve citizen's spiritual health. That is because watching music performances or pieces of art can reduce stress levels and bring a lot of joy to many people after a stressful working day. Last but not least, the art industry employs a large number of people. When a famous artist organizes a concert or a major artist holds a painting exhibition, hundreds of people are employed to ensure that the event can take place successfully. \n In conclusion, I hold the view that the government should allocate money equally to both public services and the arts because of the aforementioned advantages.","<quotation>I disagree</quotation> \n To what extent? The measured response is required. You need to frame your response to show a measured or analytical element to your response. I would have framed this, based on your response opinion, as: \n <em>I disagree with this opinion to the extent that there are valid reasons for art to recieve equal funding as public services.</em> \n Notice how the extent of my disagreement is clearer in this presentation? The measurement exists to show where my disagreement with the statement starts and ends. \n <quotation>I think</quotation> \n Remember that your opinion is scored based on 2 considerations: \n - Clarity of your opinion \n - Strength of your opinion \n Both are not met by your response due to the clear uncertainty of your presentation. Your opinion is not a valid one. \n The reasoning instructions do not support the equality of funding opinion that you stated. That is because neither reason presents any commonality in the reasoning that show an equal importance for funding, when done side by side. For example, an equal argument would be: \n <em>Funding for the arts is based on the idea of teaching people about beautification. These are done in museums through sculptures and paintings. Sponsoring the artists who create these pieces. Public services also serve to beautify our surroundings. These are done through public landscaping and artistic murals. Therefore, funding for the arts is equivalent to funding public services.</em> \n See the commonality and connectivity in the discussion. It is a clear, coherent, and cohesive discussion of a reason why public services and the arts should recieve equal funding. This is the type of reasoning that would earn you a higher scoring consideration in an actual setting. \n <quotation>because of the aforementioned advantages.</quotation> \n The requirement is for you to restate the reasons you provided in the earlier paragraphs through a simple and quick restatement. This is not a completely developed concluding summary paragraph.","The essay presents a well-constructed argument on why government funding should be equally distributed between public services and the arts. While the essay addresses the prompt directly and makes a clear argument, there are a few areas where improvement could significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and the overall impact of the argument.

Firstly, when expressing disagreement with the viewpoint that government funding should prioritize public services over the arts, the expression of this disagreement could be more precise. Instead of simply stating disagreement, it would be beneficial to clarify the extent and basis of this disagreement. For instance, saying, ""I believe funding for the arts should receive equal importance as public services because both contribute significantly to society's well-being in different yet complementary ways,"" helps articulate a more nuanced position and grounds your argument in a balanced analysis.

Secondly, the essay could be strengthened by making connections between the benefits of funding the arts and those of funding public services, illustrating how they both serve essential societal functions. For example, while the essay effectively argues that public services and the arts contribute to societal health and economic prosperity, drawing direct comparisons between how each sector enriches society can offer a stronger foundation for advocating equal funding. Presenting parallel examples, such as how public services improve physical health and infrastructure and the arts nourish mental health and cultural richness, would make a compelling case for the equal value of both sectors.

Additionally, the clarity and impact of your opinion would benefit from a more decisive and confident tone. Avoid expressions of uncertainty, and present your views as well-considered conclusions drawn from the arguments you've made. This approach will make your stance more persuasive to the reader.

Lastly, the conclusion of the essay would be more effective if it succinctly restated the key points made throughout the essay, reinforcing the argument for equal funding. It's important to briefly summarize the main arguments to remind the reader of the essay's core message as it wraps up.

By incorporating these suggestions, the essay could present a more compelling, balanced, and well-supported argument for equal government funding of public services and the arts.

While the attempt to engage with this topic is evident, there are several areas that could benefit from improvement to enhance clarity, persuasiveness, and adherence to standard English conventions.

Firstly, it's crucial to ensure the essay directly responds to the given prompt. If the task was to discuss alternative methods to interviews for job selection, mentioning these alternatives explicitly and examining their effectiveness would strengthen the response to the topic. Without the original prompt, the focus seems a bit diffuse, but generally, ensuring a clear connection to the question asked is vital.

Regarding spelling and grammar, there are noticeable issues that need addressing to meet the UK style of English writing, assuming that's the targeted academic region. For instance, uniformity in spelling (e.g., ""favour"" instead of ""favor"") and correct verb agreement (e.g., ""interviewers are"" instead of ""interviewers is"") are essential. Additionally, paying attention to subject-verb agreement and using the correct tense and form of words can significantly improve clarity. For example, ""people lose their confidence"" is correct, contrasting with ""people tend to lost there confidence."" Also, ""it is apparent"" should replace ""it is apparently,"" and vietnam should be written as ""Vietnam."" Homophones like ""their"" (possessive) versus ""there"" (location) are crucial to distinguish.

The essay sometimes struggles with coherence and precision in language, making arguments hard to follow. Simplifying language while still conveying a thorough analysis could aid readability and effectiveness. For instance, using direct and simple sentences to introduce evidence or examples will make the essay more accessible and comprehensible.

Moreover, the essay's structure could be enhanced by clearly segmenting it into paragraphs that each introduce a single argument with supporting evidence. This organization helps readers follow the logical flow of ideas. When listing arguments or examples, employing the Oxford comma can improve readability and precision, ensuring that all elements of the list are clearly understood as separate.

The point of view of the essay's author is somewhat clear, advocating for flexibility in employment methods while recognizing some merits of interviews. Enhancing this with more explicit, detailed arguments and examples would strengthen the position and make it more persuasive. For instance, discussing specific alternative employment methods in more detail, alongside clarifying how they address the limitations of interviews, would provide a more compelling argument.

Lastly, while there are arguments for and against the use of interviews, ensuring that each argument is fully developed and supported with clear examples or evidence will make a more persuasive case. Balancing the discussion by equally addressing both sides can help present a more rounded view on the topic.

In summary, focusing on a clearer structure, addressing spelling and grammar issues, simplifying language, and providing more detailed and specific arguments would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.

While this trend may bring about some benefits, I would argue that they are eclipsed by the drawbacks. \n There are numerous advantages to letting scientific research be controlled by private companies. First and foremost, it is recommended that such companies tend to meet society's expectations faster than the government. This can be explained by the fact that investing money to conduct research is likely to enhance productivity and result, hence, introducing to the masses a number of desirable products. Secondly, non-governmental companies should be in charge of carrying out scientific research in order to consolidate their reputation and position in the international arena. This helps them attract more human resources and reap profits. \n On the other hand, there are some good reasons why the authorities should take responsibility for scientific research. Firstly, it is advisable that the government is able to ensure safety and many unexpected outcomes that might occur. To be more specific they can rely on the capital flows to equip high-end facilities and support a group of scientists in terms of checking the quality and potential consequences. As a result, it would become more reliable and ethical to the consumers and their business partners. Additionally, while some independent companies seek for profits, such research conducted by local authorities might be accessible to all social classes. For instance, most citizens are able to prepare a Kit test themselves due to the convenience and the availability. \n In conclusion, while there are some benefits for private companies to carry out scientific research such as rapidly responding to people's demands and enhancing the reputation in the market, I am of the opinion that the government is much better in this field regarding minimizing the risks of these studies and the accessibility.","<quotation>around the fact</quotation> \n This is an incorrect restatement.

This analysis is pertinent to the essay question, showcasing a clear understanding of the task. However, to improve, attention should be given to how the debate is presented. Instead of stating ""around the fact,"" which inaccurately implies that the statement is factual, it would be more appropriate to introduce it as a debated topic. This change would not only enhance the accuracy of the presentation but also align better with the essay's argumentative nature, thereby potentially improving the score related to paraphrasing accuracy.

While the essay presents arguments for both sides, it misses out on fully comparing these perspectives against each other in a cohesive manner. For a stronger essay, it is beneficial to explicitly weigh these arguments against each other, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages directly in comparison. This approach would add depth to the discussion and help in maintaining a coherent flow throughout the essay.

The clarity of the author's viewpoint is commendable and serves the essay well. The concluding paragraph does an excellent job of summarizing the author's position, reinforcing the stance taken. However, the essay would greatly benefit from further development of its discussion paragraphs. Delving deeper into the implications, providing more specific examples, or offering detailed explanations could strengthen the position and make the arguments more convincing.

In my perspective, I believe international tourism brings more benefits than disadvantages, especially creates understanding between people from different customs. \n It is undeniable that travel broadens our minds. The differences among cultures stimulate human's curiosity, tourists are always ready to open their mind for inquiring about new customs, habits, they will find interests in local residents, as a result, the conversations between tourists and locals will be created and it is conspicuous that communication is the best way to build understanding and beliefs among different people whereby tourists and locals can help each other to study languages, for examples, English learners in Ha Noi often go to Hoan Kiem Lake to talk with foreigners who are able to help them improve their English speaking skill. Not only that, when tourists approach to another philosophy, they may change their minds. For examples, when Western people go to Asian countries, they may come to know how young generation respect their elder in their society and when Asian people travel to Western countries, they may know how to live independent like Western adolescences. \n On the other hand, international tourism changes people's perspective. In the modern life, people always think that watching TV, reading newspapers can help them know all about the world out there but it is definitely wrong. Maybe, all the things they know about Afghanistan are civil wars, armed conflicts and poor children but the real thing is Afghanistan is a beautiful country with sweeping valleys, stunning lakes, snow-capped mountains and gorgeous residents. Moreover, international tourism is a workable way to solve tension. For instance, when rich tourists from developing countries travel to northern Africa and the Middle East, they may comprehend more about the difficulties that local people have to face with and tourists will totally be able to help. \n In conclusion, the juxtaposition of the tension with understanding is obvious that international tourism brings more understandings between people from different cultures. It helps create international integration, strengthen solidarity and make more chances to solve municipal problems from global helps.","Dear student, you have some major errors in this essay that will automatically garner yo a failing score. The first is that you created a prompt deviation. Based upon the original discussion, you were expected to respond to the question; \n Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree? \n Your response/prompt deviation is: I believe international tourism brings more benefits than disadvantages, especially creates understanding between people from different customs. \n You changed the discussion from an extent essay to an advantage / disadvantage essay discussion. This shows that you do not understand the prompt requirement which means you will not get a passing TA score, which will then prevent you from getting the lowest possible passing score of 5 for this essay discussion. That is because you have created mistakes in other scoring sections as well which will result in further low scores that add up to a less than passing mark in the end.","Your essay on international tourism and its effects provides an interesting perspective on how it can foster mutual understanding between people of different cultures. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to better align with the essay prompt and enhance overall clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to Topic**: It seems there has been a misunderstanding of the essay prompt. The task was to express the extent of agreement or disagreement with a given statement. Yet, the essay shifts toward discussing the advantages and disadvantages of international tourism rather than focusing on the degree of agreement or disagreement. Staying on topic and directly answering the question asked is crucial for a successful essay. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay is mostly readable, there are some errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation that need attention. For example, ""oversea"" should be ""overseas,"" and there are places where pluralization is incorrect, such as ""examples"" instead of ""example."" Also, be mindful of comma usage for better sentence flow. Improving these aspects will make your essay more professional and easier to understand.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your position that international tourism is beneficial is clear. However, enhancing the clarity of your arguments by providing more structured paragraphs and clearer topic sentences can make your viewpoint even stronger. Each paragraph should start with a sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph, followed by explanations and examples that support that idea.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: You provide interesting examples to support your viewpoint, such as the interaction between tourists and locals in Ha Noi or the misconceptions about Afghanistan. To build on this, ensure each argument is fully explained and directly linked to how it supports the idea that international tourism fosters understanding. More detailed descriptions or examples could further strengthen these points.

To improve your essay:
- **Revise the introduction** to directly address the prompt. For example, ""I strongly agree that international tourism enhances mutual understanding among different cultures because...""
- **Clarify and expand your arguments** with more detailed examples or statistics where possible. This will help provide strong support for your points.
- **Focus on sentence structure and grammar**. Consider reviewing areas like subject-verb agreement, the use of articles ('a', 'an', 'the'), and correct punctuation.
- **Conclusion**: Reinforce your agreement or disagreement clearly in the conclusion, summarizing the main reasons for your viewpoint without introducing new information.

Remember, addressing the essay prompt directly and clearly is key to a successful response. By refining your arguments and improving grammatical accuracy, your essay can better convey your insightful observations on the benefits of international tourism.",3,4,4,2,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative
4116,https://essayforum.com/writing/truth-relationship-people-85357/,test,Truth in relationship between people,"What is the truth? The broad definition of the truth is to be honest and to not lie. Some people believe that not telling the truth can be an easy way to strength your friendship, marriage, or partnership. The both side can lie sometimes to complete their relationships and to stay together. However, this is not true. When one person starts to be dishonest, he or she will destroy any bonds with the other side. They cannot establish any conversation and have any agreement. Therefore, telling the truth can be hard sometimes, but it will help to have a strong relationship. This essay will explain why I hold this opinion. \n The confidence can help to build a strong relationship between two people. When they trust each other, they will have a strong bind and they will be closer. This type of tie between them can be stronger and more powerful, when they are telling the truth and they do not lie to each other. In contrary, when the both sides are dishonest to each other, they will face many problems and they will have a weak relationship. The lack of truth will destroy and ruin their life. For example, my friend Jon had a very nice and beautiful relationship with his ex-wife. They were living together and they were working together. They had a successful life until Jon decided to not tell his wife about his bankruptcy. He thought that if she did not know about his financial problems, she would be better and she would not get angry. However, he was wrong because his wife was spending money like a crazy and she borrowed many loans from the bank. After one year, they had big problems with the bank and they went to gail because they could not pay their mortgages. \n Truth is the platform to build a strong relationship between people. When people are honest, it will be easy for them to communicate. This honest relationship will open the door for a deep conversation and they will solve their problems easier because they trust each other. As a result, they will feel happy and satisfied about their life and relationships. \n In conclusion, we have to consider that telling the truth is very important in any relationships. Even though some people believe that lying can be a good solution to be close to our beloveds, I highly recommend my friends and my family to be honest and to not lie on each other.","While there are some incorrect vocabulary uses in the essay, this did not diminish the clarity of the written presentation. Your stance as to why honesty is important in a relationship is very clear. Though there are grammar issues in the presentation, you still managed to remain coherent and cohesive in terms of your discussion. However, you need to learn when to place a break in a paragraph to create a new but connected paragraph. This was the situation for your second paragraph. \n The example discussion should have been presented as a separate paragraph since it was discussing an example of the importance of honesty in a relationship. The paragraph, in the current form is difficult to read and track on the page. By separating the topic discussions into 2 paragraphs, the ease of reading could have been helped. \n Errors in spelling tend to make the reader question what you mean. For example, did you mean to use the term ""gail"" which is not a real word, instead of ""jail""? Gail is actually the name of a woman, not a reference to a place. Grammar errors include the failure to use a comma after a conjunction, using the plural form of the word side (sides),","The essay effectively addresses the topic, emphasizing the importance of honesty in relationships. The viewpoint that honesty strengthens bonds while dishonesty breaks them is clearly articulated. However, there are several aspects that could be improved to enhance the essay’s clarity and impact.

Firstly, attention to spelling and grammar is crucial as errors can distract the reader and make the message less clear. For instance, the use of ""gail"" instead of ""jail"" can cause confusion. Additionally, watch for the accurate use of plural forms, such as ""sides"" instead of ""side"" when referring to multiple people.

The essay's organization could also be enhanced. Breaking down large paragraphs into smaller, focused sections can make the essay easier to read and understand. Specifically, the narrative about Jon and his ex-wife deserves its own paragraph. This separation would highlight the example and more clearly connect it to the essay's main argument.

Moreover, some vocabulary choices and sentence structures could be refined to more accurately convey your thoughts. For example, reconsider phrases like ""the both side"" to ""both sides"" and ""to strength your friendship"" to ""to strengthen your friendship."" These adjustments help maintain a professional and coherent tone throughout.

In terms of stylistic issues, it’s vital to ensure smooth transitions between ideas to help the reader follow your argument more comfortably. Incorporating transitional phrases could improve the flow of your essay.

Finally, while the essay makes its point clear, enriching your arguments with more varied examples and deeper analysis would make your stance even stronger. Exploring different scenarios where honesty impacts relationships could provide a more comprehensive argument supporting your view.

By focusing on these suggestions—clarifying spelling and grammar, organizing content effectively, refining vocabulary and sentence structure, and deepening your arguments—you can enhance the quality and persuasiveness of your essay.",3,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

In fact, there are some who hold firmly to their belief that meeting one another face-to-face is better. As far as I am concerned, this is a higly problematic issue, and it relates to the major problems and potential solutions to deal with. Therefore, some main points will be addressed in the following paragraphs. \n To begin with, there are two primary issues caused by the pandemic. First of all, it is a well-documanted fact that most of residence have to stayed at home to prevent the community transmission by the warning of the government. The most obvious example to prove is that every activities from doing exercise to learning or working have to be done at home. Can not be denied that studying online or working online is the most vital method in the case of Covid-19's development. Furthermore, there is no doubt that some people do not have a good communication skill, particularly the introvert. For instance, it is proved that they become more openly and not feel insecure to communicate with people through a screen rather than in-person conversation. \n In order to cope with the above issue, there are a number of solutions that could be taken into consideration. First and foremost, it is commonly accepted that it is clearlier to transmit each other thoughts. Our emotion and behaviour are shifted based on the face emotion, body language, gesture, eye contact and also the voice tone of the partner. Thanks to the amount of factors above, human being can easily communicate and transmit their thoughts and feelings in the most honest way. Furthermore, there is no denying that face-to-face communication build a stronger and trustworthy relationship. It is my interesting experiment that when I joined in a non-profit organisation,I did not know anyone in that club so I decided to make friend online before we had the first meeting. The chating was good since we met other in person, the unknow barrier prevent us to be opened and it was so akwarded. But I made friends and had some humorous gossip with another members simuteniouly. \n To conclude, it is my strong belief that socialising online is just a temporary solution and just function for a long-distance interaction. Accordingly, I highly recommend that youngster should virtually have the in-person talk to improve their communication skill which is a actually significant element nowadays.","Your prompt restatement is flawed. You opted to merely restate the discussion topics rather than completing your discussion outline through diect question responses. Your restatement should contain a preliminary summary of the body paragraphs via direct responses. Why is this the case? Suggest a possible solution. complete the essence of your point of view. \n Good job on relating the reasons response to the pandemic. It shows you are up to date on current events and its relationship with the people's lives. Excellent point for discussion. Problems in that paragraph relate to word usage. ""Can Not"" is confusing because it means"" an ability to not be able to do something"" . 2 seperate words connote the confused meaning. ""Cannot"" however, one word , means an inability to do something. For this paragraph, the second reason does not relate to the first and should not be presented because of that reason. The unrelated eason weakened the discussion as it created an under-developed explanation in the presentation. \n Vocabulary issues continue to be present in the next paragraph. Do not make up English words such as "" clearlier"", "" unknow "", and ""chating"". Just because it sounds right to you does not mean the word is.in the dictionary. Look it up first. Non-dictionary inclusion means you should not use the word due to spelling and word meaning requirements of the test.","The essay begins with an attempt to set the stage for a discussion on the increasingly popular trend of online communication, contrasting it with traditional face-to-face interactions. However, it fails to succinctly frame the debate or outline the forthcoming discussion effectively. Instead of merely restating the general topic, strive to summarize your argument briefly and present a preview of the points you plan to address. This approach will help clarify your stance on the issue and make it easier for the reader to follow your argument.

A strong aspect of your essay is the connection made between the pandemic and people's reliance on online communication. Your recognition of current events and their impact on communication practices is insightful and provides a relevant context for your argument. However, the flow of your essay suffers from some problems in word usage and coherence in argumentation. For instance, ""Can not"" should be written as ""Cannot"" to avoid confusion and to convey the intended meaning of inability more clearly. Additionally, the jump from discussing the necessity of online communication during the pandemic to the challenge faced by introverts in communication feels abrupt and tangentially related. It would strengthen your essay to more clearly connect your points or to develop each one further within its own section.

Regarding vocabulary and spelling, it's important to use words correctly and to ensure they actually exist in the English language. Words like ""clearlier,"" ""unknow,"" and ""chating"" are not recognized in standard English. Always verify the correctness and existence of a word before using it in your writing. Misusing words or inventing new ones can distract from your argument and detract from your credibility as an author.

On the positive side, your argument that face-to-face communication allows for clearer expression of thoughts and stronger relationship building is compelling and well-made. Your personal anecdote about joining a non-profit organization and the difference between online chats and in-person interactions illustrates your point vividly. Sharing personal experiences can be a powerful way to engage readers and support your arguments.

To conclude, while your essay raises important points about the value of in-person communication, especially in the context of the pandemic, there are areas that need refinement for your argument to be more convincing and your writing more polished. Focus on improving your essay's organization by clearly outlining your argument at the beginning, avoiding vocabulary errors, and ensuring a more coherent development of your ideas.

Some consider that when people work, they do not only care about income but also create a good relationship with their colleagues. Others argue that it is better to widen your circle of friends with someone else besides people whom they do not work with. In my opinion, befriending with people outside the workplace is necessary but it is also important to keep a friendly environment in there. \n Making friends with colleagues is useful as it can help the working experience be a lot healthy and enjoyable. Firstly, the office is where people spend half of their day. Therefore, it would be very depressing and stressful when they do not talk or communicate with anyone in the working hour. Furthermore, only the people that they work with can understand profoundly what they have to go through so that together they can comfortably share or help one another. Networking in the workplace also help people climb higher in their career ladder, bring them many promotion opportunities. \n On the other hand, friends outside the workplace can put people out of their thoughts on work and help create a variety of relationships from different careers. People do not live all their life working after all. If their job becomes overwhelmed, it is only relaxing when they hang out and talk about other topics besides work with their friends. Also, making friends with different people with different jobs is indeed helpful. For instance, a person who is an engineer when sick can seek instant help from his acquaintance who is a doctor. \n In conclusion, friends who are either colleagues or not are great because they can be helpful in many situations related to work or personal life.","Dear student, when you write the opening statement, you are instructed to only restate the topic for discussion and the discussion type within the paragraph. You are not allowed to present nor discuss your personal opinion in the essay. Therefore, your opening statement should have merely indicated that you would be discussing your personal opinion of the issue later on in the essay. That said, I did not see an accurately developed personal opinion in the essay. Are you sure you were being asked to present a personal opinion by the original prompt? I did not see such an instruction in the directions that you posted. If you write a personal opinion when it is not required, your essay will be scored down due to a lack of understanding of the essay instructions. So double check and make sure that you responded accurately based upon your copy of the instructions. Avoid any score mark downs as best as possible because you need to increase, not decrease your scores. Your discussions in the body paragraphs are solid and informative. It creates the opinion that you are familiar with the topic for discussion and that you are speaking from personal knowledge and perhaps, experience.

However, to make your essay stronger and more aligned with typical English proficiency test expectations, consider the following feedback:

1. **Response to Topic**: Make sure the essay strictly adheres to the prompt's requirements. If the prompt does not explicitly ask for your personal opinion, introducing it in the opening statement can detract from your essay's alignment with the instructions. Ensure that the introduction clearly sets the stage for the discussion by framing it within the context of the given instructions. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is generally well-written, with minor issues in grammar and style. For example, watch out for phrases like ""befriending with people"" which would be more correctly phrased as ""befriending people"". Pay attention to grammatical structures and preposition usage to enhance clarity and readability. Further refining your writing style to ensure smoother transitions between ideas will also improve the overall flow of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: If the essay's instructions require you to discuss a topic without necessarily embedding your personal viewpoint, ensure that your point of view is communicated within those guidelines. If personal opinion is to be shared, it should be distinctly stated and well-supported throughout, especially in the latter part of the essay where it seemed to be absent or not fully fleshed out.

4. **Support for Arguments**: The essay does a commendable job of discussing the benefits of fostering relationships both in and out of the workplace. However, it could be strengthened by including more detailed examples and possibly contrasting these relationships to highlight their unique benefits further. Consider discussing how these differing social circles can specifically impact an individual’s success and happiness in more depth.

Remember, your discussions and arguments are insightful, reflecting a good understanding of the subject. Focus on aligning your essay precisely with the prompt, refining your writing for clarity and grammar, and ensuring your point of view and arguments are unequivocally presented and robustly supported.

Bank credit refusal.,"Narrative essay 1: \n The word ""rejection"" often conveys a feeling of being denied. In contrast to the negative connotations that the word might deliver, some rejection may give you a valuable life lesson; such as financial knowledge. My experience of the rejection from the bank led me to find the joy of managing the credit score. \n I was a high school senior, who just turned 18 and filled with an eager to speak out my independence as an adult. In a purpose of declaring my independence to my parents, I chose to open my own checking account. Soon after the account opening, I started hearing information on the benefits of opening a credit card from the online advertisements. After a short period of considering, I walked to the nearest bank and applied for a credit card. As a predictable result, my request was rejected; right away. \n The rejection made me feel ashamed. I felt like a little kid who tries to act like an adult while lacking financial knowledge. Although I was tempted to leave the place right away, I decided to take a step out to get out of my comfort zone and ask the reason why my request was rejected. The reason was simpler than I thought; that I do not have a credit score, therefore I was unable to apply for a credit card. Nevertheless, the teller mentioned that there are some strategies to establish credits and kindly offered me a chance to attend a seminar for the credit beginners. I gladly accepted an offer and came back home with an excitement for the financial seminar. \n Attending the seminar was a great opportunity to establish financial concepts including how to manage the accounts and build the credit. An instructor of the seminar recommended me to wait at least 6 months, since I just opened the checking account, and then apply for the student credit card that would help me to build the credit. After a long waiting game, I finally was able to receive a student credit card. Although the card did not offer any fancy features, such as cash back and bonus, I was still able to build the credit by using the card and paying the card debts. The early education of the financial concepts brought me the joy of building and managing the credit. \n Now, my credit score is about 800; which is considered an excellent tier 1 credit. I was able to lease my car with a great deal, and open several credit cards that offer various advantages based upon the great credit score. Despite the bitter rejection for an early attempt to open a credit card, it certainly turned out to be the sweet result after all; know-hows on the credit management.","Dear student, I believe that you managed to write a level 3 essay here.

To strengthen this further, consider reflecting more on how this experience has influenced your perspectives or behavior beyond just credit management.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: You have presented a compelling story as evidence for your point of view. To enhance your argument, you could add more details about how the seminar and the process of building credit have impacted your financial habits or decisions.

Despite the far distance they will have with their loved ones, students will gain a lot of knowledges that they will not regret later in their lives. In my opinion, although they may face some difficulties, studying abroad is far better than staying in their comfort zone. \n One of the greatest benefits of studying in a different country is that it will provide unique life experiences and challenges because students will have chances to learn about different cultures and languages. For example, when I studied in the United States, I was forced to deal with people from all over all the world such as doing group projects or living with them, which enhanced my social skills and I have also learned how to blend in with people with varies cultural background. Studying overseas can give you challenges not only they will make you grow as a person, but also gain a valuable life skill. \n On the other hand, one of the biggest drawbacks of studying overseas usually stem from parents being so far away. This may cause depression especially when students are facing difficulties in their daily lives. For instance, student may not be able to visit their parents often and may feel homesick every now and then. Furthermore, they cannot call their parents often because of time differences. However, in other words, it can force the young ones to be independent and learn to be on their own. Thus, despite the feeling of homesick, it may help you grow. \n In conclusion, attending universities overseas has become the new norm for better education. Although students are no doubt far away from their home and root, they will gain incredible knowledges and unforgettable experience. It is my belief that spending time overseas for higher education is much more beneficial than getting education in local universities.","The writer has neglected to restate the original topic in a manner similar to the original discussion.

The discussion presented altered the original topic focus although the discussion pattern was retained for the opinion presentation. \n Reasoning paragraph 1 was a very strong explanation in support of the opinion of the author. It showed a direct benefit as experienced by the student ata specific time in his life. This set the tone for the rest of the discussion. The problem is that instead of giving a similar representation by presenting a drawback as an advantage, as required by the discussion, the writer suddenly went into a full blown comparative discussion, instead of partial comparative discussion. This means that the paragraph strayed from the single opinion discussion instruction of the discussion prompt. This paragraph will not be considered for scoring as it became irrelevant to the opinion presented. The essay will only be given a partial score for a partially relevant discussion.","This essay attempts to discuss the benefits and challenges of studying in foreign countries. The central argument supports the idea that the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the potential difficulties. Overall, the essay maintains relevance to the topic, but there are several areas where improvement is necessary for clarity, coherence, and alignment with the requirements of a well-structured essay.

1. **Topic Response and Thesis Statement:**
The beginning of the essay does not clearly restate the topic or present a clear thesis statement in isolation. It is important to start with a brief restatement of the topic, followed by a thesis statement that clearly outlines your stance. This will provide a solid foundation for the reader and set expectations for the discussion that follows.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
There are minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as the misuse of ""knowledges"" instead of ""knowledge"" which is uncountable and should not be pluralized. Additionally, sentences sometimes run on with ideas that could be broken into separate sentences for clearer understanding. Stylistically, varying sentence structures will enhance readability and engage the reader more effectively.

3. **Point of View Clarity:**
Your personal point of view is apparent, which strengthens the essay's persuasive element. However, making this viewpoint clear from the beginning by providing a concise thesis statement can further improve the essay's clarity and focus.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:**
The argument about the benefits of studying abroad being a unique life experience is strong and enriched by personal experience. Nevertheless, the transition into discussing the drawbacks lacks balance. Instead of comparing drawbacks directly as further advantages, the essay shifts into a comparative analysis which diverges from the task's requirement of discussing a single viewpoint. Ensuring that each paragraph's focus aligns with supporting the main argument will avoid such discrepancies.

**Actionable Suggestions for Improvement:**

- Begin with a clear restatement of the topic and a concise thesis statement to guide the reader.
- Review and correct grammatical errors and pay attention to the correct use of countable and uncountable nouns.
- Break complex ideas into shorter sentences to enhance comprehension and flow.
- Maintain a consistent focus on supporting your central viewpoint throughout, ensuring all arguments directly bolster your stance without introducing comparative analyses unless directly relevant.

I cannot entirely agree with that assumption delivered, where I will elaborate on several fundamental reasons in the following. \n To begin with, the connection to social networking, particularly Facebook, enhance the opportunity for the individual to become more sociable. Because, people can get many friendships around the world, as long as they can communicate in the same understandable language. Moreover, on Facebook, the users have an excellent chance to communicate with their friends who stay in other places. Then, it is clear that having social media increases the ability to get more friends from different cities or countries. \n Secondly, possessing a broad friendship also give several advantages related to economics and cultural understanding. Today, the online platform provides marketplaces, where everyone who has an account can sell their products and buy several items. This phenomenon directly supports the stability of national economic and social productivity. In addition, international friendship in social media is also currently a place where people can assimilate other accustoms from other countries. For instance, Korean drama, which is being global trend for many young girls, spreads a global understanding of Korean culture. \n To sum up, the accessibility to social networking has many positive aspects for individuals because they have wide friendships with both domestic and international colleagues.

However, there are areas where improvement is needed to fulfill the essay requirements better and enhance the overall quality of your argument. Here are some points of feedback to consider:

1- **Response to the Topic**: Your essay addresses the topic by highlighting the benefits of social media. To strengthen your argument, it would be beneficial to briefly mention the drawbacks as well, to show a balanced view before elaborating on why the positives outweigh the negatives. This approach will make your argument more convincing.

2- **Length of the Essay**: It's important to meet the minimum word requirement for the essay, which is usually around 250-300 words. Falling short of this count may affect your score. Aim to expand your arguments or include additional examples to reach the appropriate length.

3- **Grammar and Style**: Pay attention to your use of conjunctions and prepositions, as errors in these areas can detract from the clarity and professionalism of your writing. Practicing grammar rules and reviewing these parts of speech will help improve your writing.

4- **Clarity of Opinion**: While your standpoint on the advantage of social media is clear, the introduction lacks a preliminary explanation of your perspective. In the beginning, briefly outline the reasons supporting your view to provide a foundation for your argument. This strategy will make your essay more engaging and informative.

5- **Supporting Arguments**: You've done a good job of illustrating how social media can enhance friendships and economic opportunities. However, providing specific examples or evidence to support your claims will make your argument stronger. For instance, mentioning studies or statistics related to the benefits of social media can add credibility to your essay.

6- **Balanced Discussion**: Although your essay focuses on the positive aspects, considering a few counterpoints or acknowledging potential drawbacks of social media could enrich your discussion. This doesn't mean you have to agree with the negatives, but addressing them briefly could provide a more rounded perspective.

By working on these areas, you can enhance the coherence, persuasiveness, and overall quality of your essay. Keep practicing and reviewing your work with these points in mind to further improve your writing skills.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

I somewhat agree with this change and will be discussing this further. \n During their teenage years, children are very eager to explore the outside world and are very susceptible to influence from social media. They might witness elder siblings and fictional characters on TV going out at night, partying and drinking alcohol and having fun. This can lead to teenagers sneaking out alone at night and indulging in under-age alcohol consumption which may have adverse effects on their health. \n Secondly, it is very dangerous to venture out at night due to the high crime rate. Young teens can fall easy prey to robbers, muggers and other criminals. The presence of an adult ensures they will be kept safe and stay out of trouble. \n However, there are some drawbacks to this curfew as well. We want children to understand their responsibilities from a young age. To this effect, in many states children can start working at age 14, apply for a driving licence at age 16 and even get married when they turn 18. Keeping this in mind it would be contradictory to then impose a curfew on teenagers going out alone at night. \n In my opinion, imposing a curfew is a step in the right direction. I first hand experience my friend rebelling against his parents at a young age and going out unsupervised at night. He fell in with the wrong crowd, started drink alcohol, using drugs, dropped out of school and ultimately ended up in jail. I believe this could have been avoided if there was a law enforcing the presence of an adult with teenagers after a particular time at night. \n I would like to conclude by saying that teenagers need a role-model when they are growing up. Even though they need to be taught responsibility, there is no reason for them not be supervised and kept safe from the bad elements of our society during night time.","You have not properly formed your response to the question. This is not an Agree/Disagree discussion. This is a direct opinion essay that requires an expanded response in the prompt restatement. You also did not replace enough words from the original to convince the examiner that you did not just cut and paste the said phrases / sentences from the original. Always change the keywords in the original essay so that you can score better under the LR considerations. \n Cut and paste references are: \n - accompanied by an adult. \n - In some areas of the US, a 'curfew' is imposed, \n Possible replacement phrases are: \n - In the company of an older companion / with an older companion / in the presence of an adult \n - The US implements a time limit / limits the night time exposure / allots a time allowance for out door activities \n The opinion question is: What is your opinion? Therefore, you must indicate a clear thought consideration for your discussion such as: \n - Curfew for adolescents has benefits \n - Due to the current safety climate, there is a sense of logic to limiting the evening activities of the youth \n - Limiting the outdoor time based activities of youngsters has negative effects. \n - Considering two factors, there may be problems with this scenario. \n The Task 2 essay is always limited to 5 paragraphs at the most. Your essay does not follow the personal opinion format. The personal opinion should be the second paragraph or first reasoning paragraph.

He rebelled...","Your essay addresses the topic of implementing a curfew for teenagers in the US, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for better clarity, coherence, and alignment with English proficiency testing standards. Here is some specific feedback to help you enhance your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay should begin by directly stating your opinion on the imposed curfew, as the question asks for your viewpoint. Instead of waiting until the essay's end to clearly articulate your position, incorporate your opinion early on, ideally in the first or second paragraph. This approach ensures that your stance on the issue is clear from the beginning.

2. **Use of Language and Vocabulary**: To avoid repetition of phrases from the prompt or common expressions, try using varied vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, instead of saying ""accompanied by an adult,"" you could say ""in the company of an older companion."" Furthermore, instead of stating ""a curfew is imposed,"" consider rephrasing it to ""the US sets restrictions on nighttime activities for minors."" This not only demonstrates a wider range of vocabulary but also makes your argument more engaging.

3. **Structural Improvements**: Your essay's structure needs adjustment to meet the expected format. Essays like this should ideally follow a five-paragraph format:
   - Introduction (Paraphrase the question and clearly state your opinion)
   - Opinion (Why you hold this opinion, supported by a general explanation)
   - Example (A specific example to support your opinion, in this case, the story about your friend)
   - Counterargument/Consideration of the other viewpoint (Acknowledging drawbacks or opposing views)
   - Conclusion (Summarizing your viewpoint and the reasons behind it)

    Make sure to follow this structure to create a coherent and logically organized essay.

4. **Clarity in Examples**: When discussing the experience of your friend, it's important to specify that it is not your personal experience. Use phrases that clearly indicate you're sharing someone else's story, such as ""I observed my friend's situation..."" This adds accuracy and honesty to your narrative.

5. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues**: Your essay has a solid foundation, but watch out for grammatical errors and aim for more complex sentence structures to demonstrate proficiency. Pay particular attention to verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and sentence variety.

6. **Supporting Arguments**: While you mentioned both pros and cons of the curfew, develop your arguments with more detailed explanations and consider including statistical evidence or studies to strengthen your position. This enriches your essay and provides a solid foundation for your views.

By focusing on these areas, you'll be able to create a more persuasive and well-structured essay that clearly communicates your viewpoint.

While the effort and thought put into the essay are commendable, there are several areas for improvement that would make your essay stronger and more effective.

Firstly, it is crucial that your essay directly responds to the given topic. Your essay does touch on relevant issues but consider restructuring it to follow a more organized format: begin with a clear restatement of the topic, then discuss one main problem in detail, followed by one proposed solution, and conclude by summarizing your points in a new way. This structure will help make your essay more coherent and focused.

Regarding language use, there are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues present in your essay that hinder its clarity and professionalism. For example, sentences often run on without clear breaks, making your ideas hard to follow. Practice dividing your thoughts into shorter sentences within a 3-5 sentence structure for each paragraph. This will not only improve readability but also help you convey your arguments more effectively.

It’s important that your point of view is clear throughout the essay. While you do express concerns about the Internet's influence, clarifying your position with more specific examples and explanations will strengthen your argument. Be explicit in stating your viewpoint in the introduction and reiterate it in the conclusion for emphasis.

Your arguments would benefit significantly from being more detailed and descriptive. For instance, when discussing the problem of anonymity on the internet, providing specific consequences of this issue and linking them to societal impacts would offer a stronger foundation for your argument. Similarly, when suggesting solutions, detail how these measures could be implemented and the potential benefits they might bring.

To improve your essay:
- Organize your thoughts according to the suggested structure: introduction, problem, solution, and conclusion.
- Avoid run-on sentences by breaking up complex thoughts into simpler, clearer statements.
- Ensure each paragraph elaborates on a single idea with supporting details for clarity and impact.
- Clarify your point of view at the beginning and maintain consistency throughout your essay.
- Use examples and descriptions to support your arguments, making them more compelling.

While there are some advocates of childcare centers, I believe that it is better to grandparents' concern. \n On the one hand, the argument that grandparents will be better care for their youngsters is reasonable to some extent. Firstly, the grandparents have lived for a long time and have brought up their own offspring so they have lots of experiences to take care of children. They know how to take care for both children's physical and mental health. Secondly, parents can enjoy peace of mind when leaving their children to the care of grandparents. They tend to spend much more time and effort caring for their grandchildren compared to childcare staffs. \n On the other hand, I would side with those who believe that preschool-aged children are offered the greatest services at childcare centers. The first reason is that since those centers are professional organizations their teachers are trained well in order to communicate and take care for young children. There are also specialized facilities that encourage little students to engage in both games and lessons. In addition to, children become more sociable and confident to attend to schools because they know how to make new friends when they are at childcare centers.

However, there is room for improvement to make the essay stronger and more effective.

Firstly, the introduction of the essay mentions ""controversial arguments,"" but the topic itself does not inherently suggest controversy. It's important to accurately represent the topic without adding any unnecessary exaggeration, as this can confuse the reader and negatively impact the accuracy and clarity of your essay. 

When expressing your viewpoint, it's crucial to do so with confidence. Phrases like ""to some extent"" can make your argument seem unsure. Since the essay is taking a specific stance, maintaining a sure and unwavering tone throughout would make your argument more persuasive.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written, but there are minor errors to note. For example, ""it is better to grandparents' concern"" appears to be a bit unclear. Perhaps it was intended to mean ""it is better for grandparents to take care of their grandchildren."" Additionally, there's a mistake in ""children become more sociable and confident to attend to schools."" A clearer wording would be ""children become more sociable and confident to attend school."" Also, the term ""childcare staffs"" should be ""childcare staff"" as 'staff' is already plural. Paying attention to these details can significantly improve the readability of your essay.

The conclusion of your essay should be more substantial. It currently lacks the depth and length required for a high-scoring essay. A strong conclusion should include at least 2 sentences and be around 40 words long, giving a concise summary of your arguments and reaffirming your stance on the topic.

Finally, the essay does a good job of outlining reasons for and against having grandparents take care of preschool-aged children but could benefit from clearer and more descriptive arguments. When discussing the advantages of childcare centers, for example, providing more specific examples or evidence could make your perspective more compelling.

It takes away from your actual discussion topic, which is cooperation. You should be working only on strengthening the impression that a team project will benefit the most from focusing on cooperation. You did that for the most part in the essay.

However, there are areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, accuracy, and overall impact.

1. **Topic Relevance**: It's commendable that the importance of cooperation in a team setting is the focus. Yet, it would strengthen the argument to limit discussions that lead away from this main point. While contrasting qualities like creativity can provide context, dwelling on them without directly linking back to cooperation dilutes the essay's primary argument. Concentrate more on elaborating how cooperation eclipses other qualities directly related to teamwork effectiveness.

2. **Language and Style Corrections**:
   - **Spelling and Word Usage**: Please correct ""indispensible"" to ""indispensable"" and ""coworkers"" to ""co-workers"". The phrase ""most fast"" should be corrected to ""fastest"". Additionally, ensure that ""copying"" is replaced with ""coping"" to convey the intended meaning accurately.
   - **Grammar**: Avoid starting sentences with ""because"" and joining it with a previous sentence using a comma instead of a full stop. ""Can not"" should be combined into one word, ""cannot"". After a comma, do not capitalize the following word unless it is a proper noun or at the beginning of a new sentence. Use more formal language appropriate for an essay; for instance, replace ""come up with"" with ""produce"".
   
3. **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary**: The essay would benefit from more complex sentence structures and a broader vocabulary to articulate points more succinctly and effectively. This includes avoiding repetition of phrases and ensuring the correct use of terms to avoid ambiguity. Engaging in sentence creation exercises could be a valuable practice to improve in this area.

4. **Clarity and Argumentation**: The point of view is recognizable but could be articulated more forcefully by providing more specific examples and clear reasoning why cooperation is superior in a teamwork context. The argument would have a stronger impact with a more structured presentation, where each paragraph unambiguously supports the thesis with distinct evidence or reasoning.

In summary, by honing in on the central argument about the primacy of cooperation in teamwork, correcting language and stylistic issues, and employing a richer vocabulary and varied sentence structures, the essay can be significantly improved. Focus on these areas will make the argument more persuasive and the writing clearer, contributing to a higher potential score on an English proficiency assessment.",3,3,3,3,2,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Although I disagree with this point of view, in some cases, I think having more knowledge about the country and people is also useful and necessary. \n On the one hand, the way of learning a foreign language is that you must be industrious and try your best very much. If you are lazy and do not have a good way to learn, you will not attempt to your targets that you have made before, and then you can not make any progress. Moreover, the ability of learning another language also depends on the nature. Some children who even do not speak their mother language fluently can speak a foreign one more professionally. \n On the other hand, having a well-grasp of the country where this language spoken can help you learn it easier. For example, children learn from the people who are familiar to them, they can stand, walk and speak naturally without any help. Therefore, when you research the information about any language, it will come unconcientiously to your mind. Moreover, you will learn slangs or native speaker's accent that help you improve your speaking skill very much. \n In conclusion, I disagree with the viewpoint that learning a foreign language must learn its country and cultures.","Le, you need to familiarize yourself with the types of essays used in IELTS tests and how these are discussed. In this instance, you mistakenly did a compare and contrast discussion for an essay prompt that requires a personal opinion discussion. The problem becomes instantly obvious in your paraphrasing / opening statement. That mistake altered the discussion pattern for the essay. It also proves that you have a low level of English understanding in terms of TA considerations. Based on the provided prompt, your discussion should have been as follows in the first paragraph: \n <em>There is a common belief that those who are studying a new language that there is more to learning the language. A language student must also learn about the origin country of the language inclusive of the lifestyle and culture of its society. This, in the end, should result in a better learning of the language. I disagree with this statement to a certain degree due to a number of language learning considerations.</em> \n From that point, you must discuss only the reasons that support the extent of your argument. Had the essay indicated ""Discuss both points of view and give your opinion"", then the essay that you wrote would have been perfect.

To enhance this essay, a focus on several key areas would prove beneficial.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to tackle the prompt by discussing the significance of cultural knowledge when learning a language, juxtaposed with a personal stance on the matter. However, the essay's format deviates from what might be expected for this type of prompt, which asks for a discussion centered on a personal opinion. The introduction should clearly state the personal viewpoint regarding the importance of cultural and country knowledge when learning a language. Following the introduction, the essay should solely explore reasons supporting this personal viewpoint, rather than comparing different perspectives.

2. **Structure and Content**: A more effective structure for this essay would involve four paragraphs: an introduction that presents the topic and your viewpoint, two body paragraphs each elaborating on a specific reason for your stance, and a conclusion that summarizes the discussed points and reaffirms your opinion. This structure not only enhances clarity but also provides more opportunity to develop ideas thoroughly.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay exhibits some grammatical inconsistencies (""should be knowledgable"" should be ""should have knowledge"", ""well-grasp"" should be ""good grasp"", ""unconcientiously"" should be ""unconsciously"") and instances of awkward phrasing that could be streamlined for clarity. Paying attention to verb tense consistency, proper preposition use, and sentence construction will make the argument more comprehensible and affecting.

4. **Clarity of Point of View**: While the essay indicates a personal disagreement with the statement, the articulation of this viewpoint could be strengthened. Use first-person pronouns to clearly express personal opinions and make sure each paragraph directly supports your viewpoint with clear, direct arguments.

5. **Argument Development**: Although the essay provides examples and reasons, these could be further detailed with specific, concrete examples and a clearer explanation of how cultural knowledge impacts language learning. Focusing on developing one or two core arguments in depth will provide more persuasive and engaging content.

6. **Conclusion Enhancement**: The concluding paragraph should effectively summarize the key points discussed and restate the personal viewpoint in a clear, compelling manner. Aim to paraphrase the essay prompt and the main arguments before reinforcing your stance. This not only demonstrates your English skills but also strengthens the overall coherence of the essay.

By concentrating on these areas, the essay will present a more coherent, structured, and persuasive argument that aligns with the expectations of English proficiency tests.

However, I think this is not a good sign. In the following essay, I will explain the reason for this and present my own opinion. \n One of the cause may be birth control policy imposed several decades ago. At that time, there were too many new born babies, so the government call for family planning. This concept has been deeply rooted in many people's heart since then. Second, as the social values change over time, more and more young couples disagree with the idea that they are obligated to sacrifice their youth or freedom so as to bear and raise children. Instead, they have their own dream or goal to pursue. \n In my opinion, economically, having less children born means that there will be fewer workers in the future, which may cause a dramatic decrease in a nation's productivity and economy growth. Moreover, I personally think that though having a child or more than one is a heavy burden and can be exhausting, it is definitely worthwhile and a strong sense of accomplishment to see your own children growing up and enjoy the laughter during the process. \n In conclusion, because of some policy carried out years ago and the change in people's thinking, birth rate in developed countries have been decreasing, which may lead to some negative effects.

1. **Response to Topic**: It's essential to directly answer the question posed in the essay prompt. While the essay introduces reasons for declining birth rates and a personal opinion, it falls short in directly linking these reasons to the question. To improve, try to explicitly address the prompt in your introduction and conclusion, ensuring your opinion and reasoning are clear from the outset.

2. **Structure and Clarity**: The essay could benefit from a clearer structure. Traditionally, an essay should have an introduction that briefly outlines the main points, followed by body paragraphs that explore each point in detail (one main idea per paragraph), and a concluding paragraph that summarizes the essay. Each paragraph should ideally be 4-5 sentences long to allow for adequate development of ideas without overcrowding.

3. **Coherence and Cohesion**: Your essay attempts to link ideas and arguments throughout; however, to enhance the flow, consider utilizing transition words and phrases more effectively between sentences and paragraphs. Also, ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single reason or idea to avoid underdeveloped points. This will also make your essay more cohesive and easier to follow.

4. **Grammar and Style**: Watch out for grammatical errors, such as run-on sentences or misuse of commas, which can make your essay harder to understand. Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones, and use periods to separate ideas clearly. Pay attention to spelling and consistent verb tenses to improve readability. Try to vary your vocabulary and sentence structures to demonstrate your language proficiency fully.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: While you provide general reasons and opinions on the topic, incorporating specific examples or evidence would strengthen your argument. A detailed example can illustrate your point more convincingly than general statements alone.

Remember, the goal is to communicate your ideas as clearly and effectively as possible. By focusing on direct answers to the prompt, ensuring grammatical accuracy, structuring your essay clearly, and supporting your arguments with specific examples, you can greatly improve your essay's impact and coherence.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Undoubtedly, people making preference to certain things regarding their abilities. However some kind of people may be good at something without any efforts . We have tendency to call it talent which is given to person by birth. \n There are two types of talent, nature and nurture will be taken up. \n In my point of view, people can learn something without having any certain talents to that. It comes by hard work, strong positions and life experience according to the desire. It's possible to reach our goals through keeping learning and going on to do what we want. Because people always have the opportunity to be more versatile. They have strong desire and passion to their interests enabled to reach their goals successfully. Secondly, without any efforts and practices people can not develop their skills accordingly. Further if we start to something learn from childhood it may become our habit. Accordingly not all of the things are linked with genetic capability. Thus almost many sportsmen became famous thanks to a lots of practices and exercises without any specific talents are genetically inherited. \n I'm not denying that talent is given by birth and that's like a valuable gift. We recognize that special talents like having a beautiful voice, analytical and mathematician skills are given by genetics. All of these things are inherited from parents, grandparents or relatives. \n Certainly, the vast majority consider that people having the talent since they are born has more success than other types. However this reflection is not always correct. Because as above- mentioned,only having nature talent is not enough for realizing your goals. My position in this regard, it is really important to have natural type of talent, albeit it should have to be interconnected with nurture one. Because without developing personal skills you can not completely use your natural talent.","Dear student, your thesis statement isn't really clear to the reader. You need to clarify what the thesis statement for your essay is. There is a lack of preciseness in the method by which you open you essay. Will this be a comparison discussion? Or will it be a solely personal opinion essay based upon the 2 sides for discussion. By the way, that stand alone sentence between your opening paragraph and the next complete paragraph is out of place. That should be a part of the first paragraph and not a solo sentence without a purpose in between two discussion points. \n This essay, should be discussed in a manner far more thorough and longer than the existing presentation. Each topic must be given its own paragraph or two with which you can better develop your discussions. Take for example your official second paragraph. You used the same paragraph for 2 topic discussions. As a reader I found that I was still unclear about your first point because of the lack of supporting evidence and yet I had to launch into an understanding of a second point, in the same paragraph, which was not well presented either. Therefore, the paragraph did not help increase your discussion points as it create more questions than answers for the reader. That is why you need to discuss each topic as a completely developed paragraph, without making reference to a second point in the same discussion. The second point, should have its own developed discussion as well. \n Do not start your sentences with the word ""because"". That is a connecting term / word which is only used in the middle of a sentence in order to connect 2 separate thoughts relating to the same discussion. Since it is not connecting a thought process at the start of the sentence, you must refrain from using it as an opening word or term.","Your essay delves into the interesting debate between inherent talent (nature) and developed skills (nurture). You've made efforts to present both sides, emphasizing the necessity for hard work and practice regardless of natural talent. However, there are several areas where your essay could be made clearer and more effective for the reader.

Firstly, it's essential to clarify your main argument or thesis statement. Right now, it's not immediately clear if your essay aims to compare the importance of nature and nurture or if it primarily advocates for one over the other. This clarity is crucial for guiding your reader through your argumentation.

In terms of structure, your essay would benefit from more precise organization. The standalone sentence after the opening paragraph should be integrated into the initial paragraph for smoother flow and to avoid confusion. Additionally, breaking down your essay into more distinct paragraphs can improve clarity. Each major point you're discussing should have its own section. For instance, when discussing the relevance of hard work and practice, provide specific examples and evidence in a separate paragraph before moving on to another aspect of your argument. By doing so, you help your reader follow and understand each point without being overwhelmed.

It's also noted that you sometimes start sentences with ""because."" It's advisable to avoid using ""because"" at the beginning of a sentence, as it is typically used to connect thoughts within a sentence. Starting with ""because"" can make your sentences seem incomplete or disconnected from the preceding ideas. Instead, try rephrasing these sentences for better flow and coherence.

Your essay also could be enriched by offering more detailed examples and evidence to support your points. Demonstrating how practice and dedication can lead to success, even without natural talent, or vice versa, would make your argument more persuasive. Discuss each example in its own paragraph to fully explore its relevance to your thesis statement.

Lastly, you rightly acknowledge that both innate talent and nurtured skills have their places. However, further elaboration on how these two aspects can complement each other would strengthen your argument. 

Overall, your essay contains valuable insights into the nature vs. nurture debate. With clearer organization, a more precise thesis statement, and detailed support for your arguments, your essay can become a more compelling and informative piece.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Screen-based learning including educational TV channel makes simplicity to combine several kind of learning media in one complete package.

After long-day working, they likely choose informal shows rather than formal ones which can help purifying their mind and body from complicated job by doing some refreshing activities like watching television. Based on data from informatic and technology ministry of Republic Indonesia, shop opera and games lead the race for amusing people age 15-40 years old, while people whose age is over 40 tend to watch informative program. \n In my point of view, wide range of TV channel variey give a freedom for the audience to actively choose their favourite. Adults is suggested to be more selective in particular age-restricted content when they nurture their children. This will be wise, if adult set the educational section during daytime and shift in to entertainment content during nightime. \n To sum up, educational section in TV program can brings advantages for children as it helps education process and it can be enjoyable for the youngster's routine.

The format for this discussion is always based on an explanation of the 2 public reasons, with your opinion given either as a stand alone paragraph, or as a part of the original reasoning discussion, towards the end of the paragraph. You did not complete either format in this essay. As I am unsure about whether you presented the correct discussion topics or not in this essay, I will not be able to do a comprehensive review of your essay. \n By the way, you should write no more than 290 words for this essay. You should be concentrating on making sure that you are discussing the correct topics in the reasoning paragraphs, which I do not think you did in this essay, and, you should be sure that you avoided as many grammatical errors as you could have prior to submitting the essay. That means, you can write a short essay, have time to spare for the review and finalization, and ensure that you will get the highest possible marks for your work. \n What I did notice, is that you stop short of completely explaining your reasons. After you present a supporting example, you should continue to explain how that example supports the previous opinions or, how it disproves the preceding discussion.

However, there's room for improvement in structure, clarity, and development of ideas to meet the expectations of an English proficiency test essay. Here are some suggestions for refinement:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   - Ensure that the essay accurately addresses the prompt by presenting a balanced discussion of various viewpoints on television's impact on children. The essay could benefit from a clearer structure that outlines the arguments for and against before introducing your opinion, enhancing its relevance to the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   - There are a few textual errors (""enlightentment"" should be ""enlightenment"", ""childen"" should be ""children"", ""shop opera"" likely meant ""soap opera""). Attention to spelling and grammatical details is crucial for a polished essay. Moreover, simplifying complex sentences and ensuring subject-verb agreement will aid in readability and coherence. 

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
   - While your stance on television’s educational benefits is noted, it could be more impactful if integrated within a well-structured argument. Consider stating your position clearly at the beginning or end of the essay and directly relating your examples and discussion points to this viewpoint.

4. **Argument Development:**
   - The essay would benefit from more detailed examples and explanations of how those examples support the stated viewpoint. After mentioning an example, like the educational TV channel TVRI, elaborate on its specific impacts on learning to strengthen your argument. Underdeveloped paragraphs can be expanded by not just presenting examples, but by articulating their relevance and impact more fully.

5. **Essay Length and Focus:**
   - Aim for precision and depth in your discussion rather than meeting a word count target. It's advisable to focus on developing your arguments thoroughly within the word limit, which, as noted, should ideally not exceed 290 words for some tests. This allows for reviewing and refining the essay, ensuring a concise and compelling argument within the constraints.

6. **Final Thoughts:**
   - Your essay touches on important aspects of the role of television in educational contexts. Concentrating on a balanced discussion, clear articulation of your viewpoint, grammatical accuracy, and thorough development of your arguments will not only strengthen your essay but also demonstrate advanced proficiency in English. Remember, your arguments gain persuasiveness from both the examples you choose and how convincingly you explain their importance.

Personally, I totally agree with this opinion. \n On the one hand, making money is not only the way a business exists and develops but also the way it brings potential influences on other aspects of society. It is true that the more profit enterprises create, the more taxation they contribute to national budget. As the consequence, these amount of money would be allocated to vital fields such as education, medicine or environment to serve the public. Another point is that the companies can extend their scale throughout higher revenue, which leads to more job opportunities for unemployment people in whole society. \n On the other hand, there are social responsibilities that any business should adopt. Firstly, by developing production system for more profit, many companies come at expense of environment deterioration. According to that, global warming from factory emissions or iresponsible disposal of industrial waste are unavoidable damages. Secondly, business owners should put money back into the community by philanthropic activities or scholarship funds for humanity and education purposes, which simultaneously serves as a wise social marketing strategy. For instance, Unilever, a big coperation, has gave huge charitable donations for disavantaged people and their public image is enhanced a lot due to that efforts helping community. \n In conclusion, although making money is really crucial towards businesses, I am convinced that they have strong reasons to be partly responsible for social burdens together with government.","Dear student, please keep in mind that the C&C scoring section of the task will be based on a complete paragraph presentation of 3-5 sentences. Regardless of whether this is an opening or concluding paragraph. Therefore, you need to make sure that your paragraphs meet the minimum and maximum requirements. While you did meet the requirements in your presentation, you used extremely long sentences connected by commas to connect your ideas. Long sentences and run-on sentences are not equal to a complex sentence presentation. Do not make the sentence presentations too long as it could be considered a run-on sentence and be scored down in terms of GRA considerations. \n Additionally, you should only discuss one topic per paragraph, making sure to fully develop the discussion in order to get a better C&C score. Coherence and cohesiveness is all based on the number of sentences and the strength and clarity of your explanation. That is why you have to limit yourself to only one topic per paragraph. With 5 sentences allotted per paragraph, there is no room for a full 2 topic discussion. \n Now, to deal with the major problem of the essay. This is an extent, single opinion essay. While you gave an appropriate response for your thesis statement, you took the compare and contrast discussion route in the body of paragraphs, which is the wrong approach to this essay. Whenever you see the word ""or"" in the prompt, that means you can only discuss one side of the topic in the essay. Otherwise your essay will only be scored on a partial basis, focusing on the ""extent"" response that you presented. This mistake often results in a less that stellar score for the exam taker.

This perspective aligns well with the essay topic, ensuring relevance throughout. However, there are essential areas to refine for a stronger submission, particularly concerning structure, clarity, and argument depth.

1. **Structure and Sentence Complexity**: The essay demonstrates an attempt to create complex sentences. Still, it often results in overly long sentences that can be hard to follow. It's crucial to differentiate between a complex sentence structure and long, run-on sentences. Instead of using commas to connect multiple ideas in a single sentence, consider breaking them into shorter, clearer sentences. This approach will not only enhance readability but also prevent the potential for run-on sentences, which could negatively impact your grade.

2. **Paragraph Development**: Each paragraph should ideally focus on one main idea. This can help in fully developing your argument within the constraints of 3-5 sentences per paragraph, as required. By concentrating on a single topic per paragraph, your essay will benefit from improved coherence and cohesion. This means your ideas will be clearer and connected, making your argument stronger and more persuasive.

3. **Focus on Singular Perspective**: The essay tends to discuss both sides of the argument by comparing and contrasting different viewpoints. While this demonstrates a broad understanding, the task requires you to present and support a singular perspective thoroughly. When the prompt presents an option with ""or,"" it's vital to choose one stance and explore it deeply throughout your essay, rather than discussing multiple perspectives. This approach will align your essay more closely with the expectations of the assignment and potentially lead to a higher score.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: Your essay benefits from explicit examples and clear arguments in support of your viewpoint. However, further elaboration on these examples and a deeper analysis of why businesses should engage in community duties could strengthen your position. For instance, when mentioning Unilever's charitable contributions, elaborating on the impact of these actions on both the community and the company itself could make your argument more compelling.

To enhance your essay, consider revising for sentence complexity and focus on developing one idea per paragraph. Ensure your argument remains focused on a singular perspective, as required by the task prompt. By addressing these areas, your essay will likely present a stronger, more coherent argument that is not only closer to the task requirements but also more engaging and persuasive to read.",3,3,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Instead of indicating indecision by acknowledging both the advantages and disadvantages without a clear stance, it's important to choose a position and argue it convincingly through the essay. A lack of a clear opinion can negatively impact the essay's effectiveness and the scorer's perception of your argumentative skills.

3. **Punctuation and Grammar Errors**: The essay contains several punctuation and grammar issues, including the misuse of commas and ellipses together, spelling mistakes (e.g., ""citizents,"" ""appreciated,"" and ""contrasted"" are misspelled), and incorrect word usage (e.g., ""For instant"" should be ""For instance""). Only one punctuation mark should be used at a time, and accurate spelling is essential for clarity and professionalism.

4. **Argument Development and Examples**: While the essay introduces some examples and reasons to support its points, these arguments need to be more developed and descriptive. For instance, the claim about Japanese residents and GDP growth lacks specificity and a credible source. Additionally, ensure that examples are realistic and directly support your main argument.

5. **Coherence and Academic Presentation**: The essay's coherence can be improved by organizing ideas more logically and transitioning smoothly between them.

Busy traffic also creates pollution problems that endanger our lives. To overcome these problems, people suggest the government to increase the price of petrol and I agree with this viewpoint. In addition, increasing the license fee is another effective solution. \n Raising the price of petrol can significantly reduces the numbers of vehicles travelling on the road and effectively control the growth of traffic because the cost of driving will be too high to afford by the general public. The cost of fuel plus other expenses including vehicle insurance and maintenance will reduce people's incentive to own a private car and switch to public transportation. For example, the travelling cost from downtown to the airport by car is around a hundred dollars whereas bus fare is just less than thirty dollars. As a result, the government can resolve traffic congestion easily by adjusting the petrol price level. \n After the number of vehicles on the road has decreased, the air quality will improve that leads to better health condition of the citizens. This is because the combustion of petrol in vehicle engine emits a lot of harmful particles to the air and causes various kinds of respiratory diseases after being inhaled by human. For instance, statistics shows that the air pollution index in areas near major highway or city centers with busy traffic are on average three times than that of the countrysides. \n In addition to the above measures, the government can double or triple the existing vehicle license fee and this act will discourage people to maintain their cars and travel by other means, thus reduce the amount of cars on the road further. \n To conclude, the solutions to our traffic problem lies in the hand of our government.

Here’s how to strengthen your essay further:

1. **Introduction Clarity**: Start with a clear introduction of the topic. Instead of jumping into facts, first, paraphrase the original prompt. This means you should briefly restate the topic in your own words and then mention your stance. For instance, ""The increasing time spent in traffic due to congestion and its impact on pollution levels suggests a need for action. I believe that raising petrol prices and license fees could be effective solutions.""

2. **Essay Structure**: Your essay should have at least four developed paragraphs: an introduction, two or more body paragraphs discussing your reasons, and a concluding paragraph. Ensure each paragraph serves its purpose. For example, your introduction should clarify the topic and your stance, body paragraphs should each discuss a unique point supporting your view, and the conclusion should summarize your arguments and restate your opinion.

3. **Cohesion and Coherence**: Link your ideas more smoothly. Try using transition words like “furthermore,” “for example,” or “as a result” to connect sentences and paragraphs. Ensure each paragraph flows well into the next. Also, make sure your argument progresses logically through the essay.

4. **Task Response and Position Clearness**: Make sure to directly address the question posed. When asked whether you agree or disagree with a statement, incorporate this language into your introduction and conclusion to make your position clear. This can be achieved by stating, ""I agree to a significant extent and will outline my supporting reasons below.""

5. **Accuracy and Grammar**: Pay attention to grammatical accuracy. For example, correct usage would be ""Raising the price of petrol can significantly reduce"" instead of “reduces”. Be mindful of singular and plural nouns, verb tenses, and the structure of your sentences to avoid confusion and maintain clarity.

6. **Vocabulary**: Use a wide range of vocabulary but ensure it is used correctly to convey your message clearly. Avoid repetition by using synonyms.

7. **Conclusion Strength**: Your conclusion should clearly summarize the main arguments presented in your essay. Restate your stance and briefly mention the reasons behind your position to reinforce your viewpoint.

This development has both pros and cons, whereas the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits. \n To begin with, there are probably a couple of reasons why technology benefits family relationships. Firstly, family members can easily contact others whenever they are far away from each other. Almost everyone, even children and the elderly people, have their own phones with various applications installed so they can call or text other members effortlessly. For example, a student goes to the university far away from his town, when he misses his parents he can have a video call with them by using social media on his phone. Secondly, people can use technology as a tool for retaining some remarkable memories. As aforementioned, everyone has their own mobile phones so it is possible to take pictures, videos. These memorable images can be shared with family members, this is a good way for a family to bond together. Thus, technology has improved relationships in some ways. \n On the contrary, disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Firstly, due to technology, face-to-face conservation seems to be less effective among the members in a family. Due to the Internet, people can make many new friends online; however, they spend so much time on social media that they don't have time for relatives. Secondly, there are some differences between the young and the elderly's favorable trends. Young people often care about funny things shared on Tik Tok, etc... while the elderly people are attracted to something more different. For example, young people love to post the memes on instagram, twitter... but our grandparents are more likely to read more online news. Because of these contrast favors, the young and the old don't usually have some common topic to share with each other. Last but not least, technology is way more common with young people; therefore the young can fastly learn some bad trends that affect their regular behavior. Adults may not appreciate these kinds of attitudes, this leads to depreciated behavior and even arguments between parents and their children. \n To sum up, the evolution of technology has brought us some good effects on our relationships; however, there is no doubt that it also badly affects human's interaction.","The writer should refrain from presenting a personal opinion within an advantage or disadvantage prompt presentation.

However, there are several areas that require attention to improve the essay's clarity, coherence, and alignment with the topic.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to present a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of technology on family interactions but deviates by implying a personal stance that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. For this type of essay, maintaining an unbiased view is crucial. Focus on discussing each side equally without presenting a personal opinion unless specifically asked for it.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:** The use of terms such as ""pros and cons"" alongside ""advantages and disadvantages"" introduces inconsistency. It's important to stick to the terms used in the essay prompt to ensure clarity. Additionally, avoiding expressions of uncertainty like ""probably"" will strengthen the essay's authority and cohesiveness. Your arguments should be presented with confidence.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay contains minor grammatical errors and stylistic issues that can be improved. For instance, ""face-to-face conservation"" likely intended to be ""face-to-face conversation."" Also, pay attention to the composition of sentences to avoid overly long or complex structures that might confuse readers. Use simpler language where possible to keep the essay accessible.

4. **Point of View and Arguments:** While the essay aims to discuss both sides of the topic, there's a noticeable bias towards the disadvantages of technology in family interactions. When writing, ensure that each side of the discussion is explored equally. Avoid mixing the essay's intentions by shifting from discussing advantages and disadvantages to debating pros and cons, which might confuse readers about your main points.

5. **Supporting Arguments:** The essay provides examples to support its points, which is positive. However, to enhance your essay, ensure that each argument or example directly relates to the central idea you are discussing. Avoid generalizations and ensure that examples used are clear and directly support your analysis.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

- Revise the essay to maintain a neutral tone throughout, presenting both sides of the argument equally and refraining from indicating a preference unless explicitly asked.
- Stick to the terms and structure specified in the essay prompt to ensure clear and coherent discussion.
- Simplify language and sentence structure for better clarity and readability.
- Review the essay for grammatical errors and revise for clarity and precision in arguments.

Improving these aspects can enhance the overall effectiveness and coherence of your essay, allowing for a stronger presentation of your views on the topic.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

I do not agree that pictorial news can expose and determine the information better than words. To illustrate, I will first describe the prominent aspect of the pictures, and second, discuss its function as an illustration. \n It will be vast and unorganized information if all the news arises without distinction, and notable news could not be found even though it carries exclusive information that is worth reading. Therefore, photos or pictures have been becoming an interpretation, which intentionally bloats and distinguishes a story from the news surrounded, so readers manage to discover and read it first. For instance, in the Fox News or the New York Times, the stories contain pictures that always capture reader's consideration prededence the rest of the news. \n Besides, photos that included in the report are an adequate implication and explanation toward audiences. They might be able to infer and extrapolate data through illustration in a picture, so the content of the article could be understood prior to the entire story. Some editors or authors prefer to illustrate the content of the report by summarizing, and insert it into the picture as a short brief and introduction, which help them consolidate the prominent of the article. \n In conclusion, the images, not only do it expose the news but also encapsulates its content.

You have to remember that there is a difference between pictures published in newspapers and pictures used in the news reports.

You should have stopped at the disagreement reference. The last line in your presentation indicates a prompt deviation because you did not focus on the correct discussion topic anymore. \n <em>Original Topic: Some people say that these pictures are more effective than words.<br/>Your Deviation: I will first describe the prominent aspect of the pictures, and second, discuss its function as an illustration.<br/>Your Actual Topic: I do not agree that pictorial news can expose and determine the information better than words.</em> \n You accidentally created a prompt deviation in your effort to try and create an impressive direct response.

There is no such word as ""prededence"", You mean to say ""precedence"" which means the condition of being considered more important than someone or something else. Review your essay every time before submission and make sure you have double checked all the scoring requirements to avoid point deductions once your work is scored. Every mistake has an equivalent subtraction from your total score, which could result in your failing the test.","**Final Feedback:**

The essay begins with the assertion that pictures in news reports and newspapers are not more effective than words in conveying information. The essay attempts to argue this point by discussing the role and function of pictures in news dissemination. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to make the essay more effective and aligned with the topic.

1. **Clarity and Relevance to the Topic**: It's crucial to ensure that the essay directly responds to the given topic without deviation. The introduction suggests a broader examination of pictures' role in news without directly addressing the effectiveness of pictures versus words. It's essential to stick closely to the stated topic—whether pictures are more effective than words in news reports—to avoid confusing the reader or straying off course.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Vocabulary**: The essay exhibits some spelling errors (e.g., ""prededence"" should be ""precedence"") and instances of awkward phrasing. Paying closer attention to spelling and sentence structure will greatly improve the readability and professionalism of your essay. Additionally, using words and phrases accurately will enhance the clarity and impact of your arguments. Always review your essay for potential errors and consider if each word is used correctly in its context.

3. **Clear Point of View**: Your essay presents a viewpoint that pictures are not superior to words in conveying news effectively. To make your point of view clearer, refine your arguments to directly contrast the effectiveness of images and words, providing specific examples and explanations to support your position. 

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The essay's arguments would benefit from clearer and more detailed explanations. For instance, when discussing how pictures can bloat or distinguish a story, providing concrete examples would enhance your argument. Similarly, when claiming that pictures provide an adequate explanation for audiences, clarify this with examples or data that show how or why this is the case. This will make your essay more persuasive and informative.

To improve your essay, focus on directly responding to the essay question with a clear and concise argument. Avoid broad or generalized statements that could detract from your main points. Pay careful attention to spelling, grammar, and the accurate use of vocabulary to convey your ideas more effectively. Finally, strengthen your arguments with clear, specific examples and explanations.

Improving these aspects will significantly enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of your essay, making your position on the topic clearer and more compelling to your reader.",3,4,3,3,2,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Reasons 3 or personal opinion (whichever is required by the discussion instruction) \n 5. Concluding summary \n All of these essays are composed of a minimum of 3 sentences, maximum of 5 sentences. Each paragraph must contain only one fully developed explanation. That is why you have 3 body paragraphs with which to discuss your reasons and opinions. Do not go over 5 sentences with 1 topic per paragraph because that will result in an incoherent and non-cohesive paragraph presentation which will definitely lower your score. \n Going back to the opening paraphrase. You must familiarize yourself with the way this is written as well. You need to rephrase the original prompt in your own words with a thesis sentence that responds to the discussion instruction.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the effectiveness and clarity of your message, in alignment with the standards of an effective essay for English proficiency tests like the IELTS Task 2.

1. **Essay Structure**: Your essay currently does not adhere to the recommended five-paragraph structure that is critical for IELTS Task 2 essays. This structure includes an opening paraphrase, two to three body paragraphs with individual reasons supported by examples, and a concluding summary. Each paragraph should contain one main idea, explained in three to five sentences, to ensure clarity and cohesiveness in your argumentation.

2. **Opening Paraphrase**: The introduction of your essay should start with a paraphrase of the original prompt, followed by a clear thesis statement expressing your stance. Your current opening could be improved by more clearly rephrasing the prompt in your own words and explicitly stating your position using emotionally resonant terms, such as ""strongly disagree"", to align with the task's requirements for an ""emotional"" essay. Aim to set the stage for your arguments without delving into them just yet.

3. **Clarity and Cohesion**: Your essay would benefit from sharper clarity and cohesion between paragraphs. Each paragraph should explore a single point fully. This approach helps the reader follow your line of argumentation more easily and benefits your score by presenting a well-organized and coherent argument.

4. **Grammar and Style**: There are some spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues that detract from the overall quality of your writing. Pay attention to verb agreement (e.g., ""using social networking sites have"" should be ""using social networking sites has""), and proper use of articles (e.g., ""an application as a term of communication""). Simplifying sentence structures can also aid in reducing errors and enhancing clarity.

5. **Point of View and Argumentation**: Your point of view is somewhat clear, as you disagree with the notion that social media has a largely negative impact. However, strengthen your argument by providing more specific examples and clearer reasoning in support of your viewpoint. Each supporting point should be discussed in its own paragraph with sufficient detail.

6. **Concluding Summary**: Your conclusion should summarize your main points and reiterate your stance in a succinct manner. This ties your essay together and reinforces your argument to the reader.

In sum, focusing on a structured approach that clearly introduces your thesis, develops your arguments in dedicated paragraphs, and concludes with a summary of your stance will make your essay more coherent and impactful.

For example, Cristiono Ronaldo which is a football player in Real Madrid Football Club is paid £ 360.000 each weak. In fact, he just do a simple work that is kicking ball to make goals.

This is a relevant response to the topic. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make a stronger case.

1. **Essay Structure**: The essay would benefit from a more structured approach. It's important to organize the essay into five distinct paragraphs: an opening statement, two paragraphs each detailing a reason for the opinion, a paragraph with examples or supporting evidence, and finally, a summary conclusion. This structure helps to clarify the argument and ensures each point is given enough space to be developed properly. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay contains several spelling and grammatical errors that can detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing. For instance, ""professional"" should be ""professionals,"" ""weak"" should be ""week,"" and ""actor professionals earn enormous salary that other professionals"" is a sentence that lacks clarity and could be rephrased for better understanding. Attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and sentence structure will improve the overall quality of the essay.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The viewpoint of the essay is clear, which is a strength. It argues that health workers and educators should be valued more highly than sportspeople and entertainers. However, strengthening the argument with more detailed reasons and clearer examples would make the viewpoint even more persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence**: While the essay provides examples, such as Cristiano Ronaldo's salary and the role of teachers in post-WWII Japan, these arguments could be developed further. Specifically, it's vital to connect each example explicitly to the main argument to illustrate why health workers and educators should be valued more highly. Offering detailed evidence and explaining how it supports your case will make your argument more compelling.

Additionally, it’s important to focus on one main idea or topic per paragraph to allow for a more in-depth discussion. This approach avoids confusion and ensures that each point is fully explored, thereby improving the cohesiveness and clarity of the essay.

Firstly, it's important to establish your point of view directly and concisely. Instead of stating ""Studying a second language at an early age creates a wide variety of benefits,"" which doesn't directly answer the topic, begin with a strong thesis statement that clearly presents your argument. For example, ""I believe that studying a second language from an early age is crucial for children's cognitive development and social skills."" This approach directly expresses your opinion and sets a solid foundation for your essay.

Moreover, while the essay introduces the benefits of bilingualism, such as improved memory, problem-solving abilities, and social skills, these points need to be expanded with more detailed explanations or examples. For each benefit mentioned, try to provide specific examples or cite studies that support these claims. This will make your arguments more convincing and your essay more engaging.

On the topic of structure, it's important to maintain focus on the assignment's requirements. The prompt asks for your point of view, so introducing counterarguments or discussing opposing viewpoints (""On the other hand..."") might make your essay seem unfocused or weaken your position. Keep your essay concentrated on supporting your thesis with clear and descriptive arguments that reinforce your stance.

Lastly, pay attention to grammar and stylistic issues. The essay generally uses correct grammar, but careful proofreading can always catch minor errors and help improve the flow of the text. Use a variety of sentence structures to make your writing more dynamic and interesting.

In conclusion, enhancing the thesis statement, providing more detailed examples, maintaining focus on supporting your viewpoint, and careful editing for grammar and style will significantly improve the quality of the essay.

Firstly, the introduction to the topic does not clearly restate the original prompt or provide a clear direction for the essay. It's essential to first present the topic accurately and then introduce personal opinions systematically within the body of the essay rather than in the introduction. Doing so will ensure that the essay follows a logical structure and meets the requirements of a balanced discussion.

The discussion of the negative aspects of video games could benefit from clearer and more specific examples. Instead of relying on a generalized anecdote from YouTube or vague references to gamers' behaviors, offering concrete studies or statistics could strengthen the argument. Additionally, the assertion that video game addiction is more impactful than drug addiction is a strong claim that requires substantial evidence to be convincing.

On the positive side, the mention of video games as a tool for learning and socializing is valuable. However, these points could be expanded with more detailed explanations or examples of how games have been directly beneficial in these areas. 

The conclusion of the essay does not effectively summarize the discussed points or present a clear personal stance on the issue. It's crucial for the conclusion to reflect on the content and provide a concise statement of the writer's view, based on the arguments presented.

Stylistic and grammatical issues also hinder the clarity and professionalism of the essay. Using correct subject-verb agreement, such as ""Video games are"" instead of ""Video games is"", and avoiding run-on sentences will improve readability. Proper punctuation and varied sentence structures can also enhance the essay's flow.

From my point of view, I consider myself in agreement with the statement. \n For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reckon that having an oversea holiday to learn about a country and its people is the best method. One of the main reasons is that hotels always offer tourists good and luxury services to confine them within the hotel zone to enjoy those services. It leads to the notion that quite a few tourists frequently be too lazy to discover the nation they are traveling just because of spending time on the services of the hotels. To make sense of that, for instance, quite a few hotels provide luxury meals and playing rooms to tourists so that they may take a whole day within the hotel zone. \n Another reason is that doing so causes tourists to fail to obtain the knowledge they want in an oversea country. Therefore, people cannot realize the local culture or even what happens outside the zone of the hotels when they are in that zone. Quite a few harmful impacts may place pressure on local tourism because of transferring the wrong information about the country by tourists. To several tourists, sharing wrongly the knowledge they know is frequently happen, because sometimes they do not realize the knowledge they obtained is the case or not. \n To conclude, my point is that if tourists want to comprehend more about a foreign country's culture and people, just go out of the comfortable zone and experience more so that they can know whatever they want.

This clear stance is a strong point of the essay. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the essay's clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, the introduction could benefit from a more detailed paraphrasing of the prompt, aiming for a fuller explanation over 3-5 sentences. For example, instead of immediately stating agreement with the statement, briefly describe the common practice of tourists staying in hotels and how this is perceived in relation to truly understanding a country. This approach sets a stronger foundation for the essay by clearly outlining the issue at hand.

Regarding the structure, the essay could be more impactful by ensuring each paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence that relates directly back to the thesis. This would help in guiding the reader through the argument in a more organized manner. Specifically, focus on two main reasons why hotel stays limit understanding of a country: 1) hotels offer luxury services that deter exploration, and 2) this confinement impacts genuine learning about the country. Each paragraph should explore these points in depth, directly linking them to the central thesis.

The essay also faces challenges with spelling, grammar, and style. For instance, ""oversea"" should be ""overseas,"" and sentences could be simplified for clarity and coherence. Avoid overly complex phrases and aim for straightforward, precise language. This approach will make the essay more accessible and engaging to a broader audience.

Moreover, the argument would be strengthened by providing specific, real-world examples to support claims. While the essay mentions hotels offering luxury services, concrete examples of how this impacts tourists' understanding of local culture would be more persuasive.

Finally, the conclusion needs to effectively summarize the key points discussed, rather than introducing new arguments or repeating supporting reasons. A concise recap of the main reasons followed by a reaffirmation of the thesis can offer a strong closure, signaling to the reader that the essay has fully addressed the prompt.

In summary, focusing on these areas—paraphrasing the introduction, clarifying the structure with topic sentences, refining the language, providing concrete examples, and improving the conclusion—will greatly enhance the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the essay.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Furthermore, succeed is the only thing people fight for, the same as the caregivers, they want their youngsters to have the good position in society. For example, Asian parents will take their kids to many academic centers to learn at extra classes, thus they win with flying colors and be a good leader. Therefore, children have more pressure by their parents. \n Many people believe this prespective lead to a positive development because ancientors have once said pressure can make a diamond. For instance, if a young child is put enough pressure by his caregivers, definitely oneday that child will have a lot of social positions. As a result, not only the child prouds of himself or herself but also he or she become the good example for many people. \n In conclusion, as fas as I concern, chidren can be in their better version within the parents' pressure and this sould be encouraged more. I suggest parents should put pressure on their children in the right method so that advoided children being stressed.","The first paragraph is the writer's restatement and opnion presentation. This is based on the original discussion directive. It is a direct restatement of the original topic. It should not included writer's opinion in the opening presentation. In this instance, the writer's opinion \n <quotation>children are the one who are hoped to be successful by parents</quotation> \n should not be a part of the restatement. It can however, be integrated into the direct response for the writer's opinion. \n The writer's opinion should directly respond to the questions being asked by presenting a summarized form of his reasoning paragraphs. That means, the writer should not restate the discussion instructions because he will not receive a TA score for that. The TA score is based at the start on the writer's direct responses to the provided questions. Known as the thesis statement, it helps establish the discussion path of the essay in the succeeding paragraphs. \n The reasoning paragraph division is incorrect in this presentation. While the second paragraph or first reasoning paragraph establishes the reasons behind the pressure and equally establishes the evidence for this claim, The positive or negative opinion was not clearly explained in the next paragraph as expected. Rather, the writer incorrectly used it as a concluding statement for the essay, which would lead to an automatic failing score. The automatic failing score will be due to the lack of proper summarized conclusion based on the preceding discussion. The positive or negative opinion should have been a stand alone third paragraph or second reasoning paragraph because it requires a completely developed discussion and evidence presentation similar to the causes paragraph. This is only a 4 paragraph discussion based on the provided discussion topics. The questions will always dictate the number of reasoning paragraphs, which will range between 2 - 3 paragraphs. The rule of thumb is: \n 1 question = 2 reasoning paragraphs \n 2 questions = 2 reasoning paragraphs \n 3 questions = 3 reasoning paragraphs \n An additional error in the concluding statement is that the writer indicated a possible solution or suggestion to the situation. This is a statement that is not a part of the discussion development instruction. It led to a prompt change as it is an additional topic. Additionally, it left the essay without a proper concluding summary presentation. The lack of a proper summary conclusion will always result in a failing score for the essay.","The essay you've written is on a topic that elicits strong opinions and you've chosen an interesting angle to approach it from. However, to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing, there are several areas to consider for improvement. 

Firstly, the introduction of your essay restates the topic and introduces your opinion, which is good practice. However, it is crucial that the introduction focuses more on directly responding to the essay question without overly repeating the topic's wording. Instead of including your viewpoint in the introductory restatement, position it as a concise thesis statement that guides the reader through your arguments in the following paragraphs.

In terms of structure, your essay is divided into paragraphs that attempt to develop your reasoning. Nevertheless, the division between these paragraphs needs reconsideration. Your first reasoning paragraph effectively outlines the reasons parents might pressure their children, but your analysis on whether this leads to positive or negative development is placed in the conclusion rather than being explored in its own separate paragraph. This approach limits your essay's ability to fully develop and support the central argument. Remember, each major point you make should ideally be expanded upon in its own paragraph, especially when the essay prompt splits its inquiry into multiple parts. 

Regarding content, the use of examples and the effort to support your arguments are commendable. However, it's important to ensure that each argument receives sufficient development. The essay could benefit from a more balanced exploration of both the pros and cons of parental pressure, with each point backed by specific evidence or examples. 

Additionally, your essay concludes with a suggestion or solution, which, while thoughtful, diverges from the traditional conclusion approach. The conclusion should summarize the key points of your argument and reinforce your stance on the issue rather than introducing new ideas or proposals. A strong conclusion draws together your arguments in a way that reaffirms your thesis statement without simply repeating it verbatim.

On a linguistic level, there are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues to address:
- Be mindful of spelling errors and the correct use of words (e.g., ""beginning"" instead of ""begining"", ""avoided"" instead of ""advoided"").
- Pay attention to consistency in verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.
- Aim for clarity in your sentences. Sometimes simpler sentences can more effectively convey complex ideas.

In conclusion, paying attention to the organization of your essay, supporting your points with developed reasoning, and refining your grammar and style will significantly improve the clarity and persuasiveness of your writing. Remember, writing is a process that involves drafting and revising, so continue to practice and refine your approach.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

However, it is supposed that the extinction of animal species such as land and marine animals results from human activities, especially is deforestation and dynamite. This can stem from many causes, which calls for possible solutions to be adopted. \n The extinction of animal species can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, one possible reason could be that deforestation is in alarming rate since the overpopulation booms. People have to meet the housing demand. Not only is the loss of animals' habitat threatened but also land animals will be hunted by wrongdoers who carry out the illegal activities. Another cause worth mentioning is that dynamite is the most cruelest way to catch marine animals. To be more specific, when using this weapon, there is an enormous explosion that makes penty of creatures injure seriously, even cause a thousand of deaths. Then they will be brought to sell. \n There are several measures which can be taken to handle this issue. To begin with, should a heavy punishment be imposed to offenders by the government. This can be done by imprisoning them from three to five years for ruining the resources of environment to ensure they will not reoffend. In marine life, the government should prohibit people from catching fish by dangerous chemicals. Under any circumstances, if they want to catch fish mainly because having the end meet, their activities must be manual. \n To a word, the extinction of animal species results from many causes, and there are several actions that can be taken to tackle this issue.","as a direct question essay, you are required to present your simplified response to both questions, in this case the causes and possible solutions, within the opening paraphrase. These reasons and causes will serve as the 2 reasoning paragraph outline for your essay. Now remember, this is an advanced writing type of essay so you will need to use transition sentences in each paragraph to relate 2 reasons and 2 solutions in each paragraph presentation. That means, you need to use the maximum of 5 sentences per paragraph in the following manner: \n Sentence 1 - First reason \n Sentence 2 - Supporting example \n Sentence 3 - Transition sentence \n Sentence 4 - Second reason \n Sentence 5 - Supporting example \n The same format goes for the solutions, this time replacing the term ""reasons"" with ""solutions"". In reality, your presentation was close to the above format except you lacked a transition sentence in the middle of the paragraph and you lacked supporting examples that could have strengthened the presentation. You also went over the maximum sentence number in the first reasoning paragraph. You should never write more than 5 sentences per paragraph. \n Additionally, your concluding statement is very weak as it does not offer a proper summary of the prompt, reasoning, and solutions as indicated for the reverse paraphrase requirements of the concluding summary.","The essay provided addresses the issue of animal species extinction due to human activities, specifically highlighting deforestation and the use of dynamite in fishing as primary causes. Furthermore, it suggests solutions, including imposing heavy punishments on offenders and regulating fishing methods. Here's how the essay could be improved:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the given topic by discussing the causes of animal species extinction and proposing solutions. Nevertheless, to enhance clarity and coherence, introducing the main causes and solutions concisely in the opening paragraph would set a clearer framework for the reader. This approach directly responds to the essay prompt and prepares the reader for the detailed discussion that follows.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few areas that need attention. For example, ""modrenized"" should be corrected to ""modernized,"" and ""penty"" should be corrected to ""plenty."" Additionally, phrases like ""the most cruelest"" are grammatically incorrect and redundant; it should be ""the most cruel"" or simply ""the cruelest."" To improve readability and ensure a professional tone, consider revising sentences that feel cumbersome or overly complex. Simplifying language will not only help in meeting the proficiency standards but also in making arguments more accessible to readers.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay's point of view, advocating for actions against the causes of animal extinction, is generally clear. However, making a decisive stance in the introduction and using more assertive language throughout the essay could reinforce the author's viewpoint. For instance, instead of saying ""This can stem from many causes,"" a stronger stance would be ""Human activities, notably deforestation and the use of dynamite in fishing, are primary causes of this extinction.""

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay mentions causes and solutions but lacks detailed examples and transition sentences that could strengthen the argument. Using a structured approach with each paragraph containing a reason or solution followed by a supporting example, and then linking these with transition sentences, would significantly enhance the argumentative strength of the essay. For each cause or solution mentioned, providing specific, real-world instances or data would make the argument more convincing.

5. **Concluding Remarks**: The conclusion should not only restate the essay's main points but also synthesise them to reinforce your stance. An effective conclusion also indicates the significance of the solutions and the urgent need for action. Phrasing such as ""In conclusion, addressing the root causes of animal species extinction through stringent regulations and public awareness is critical for preserving biodiversity"" would offer a stronger, more persuasive closing statement.

By focusing on these areas—ensuring a direct response to the prompt, correcting linguistic errors, stating a clear viewpoint, structuring arguments effectively, and crafting a compelling conclusion—the essay will significantly improve in clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"the way people relax today \n It has been controversial for a long time about how people can relax and relieve their stress. Some people believe having time with others have more advantages than being alone since we are a social being who prefer to interact with one another. I partially agree with the opinion in terms of several benefits it can bring us, but I believe that the most ideal way to relax and relieve stress is having time alone since all kinds of stress eventually stem from our mind. \n Having time with others is meaningful activities to refresh ourselves by sharing our concerns and communicating with others. In general, people have common instinct desiring to talk or listen to someone so that it would be effective to have a relaxing time. Nonetheless this advantage, it also stresses people. According to a research, what stresses people in a house and job is a relationship with others. In other words, most of the people get stress as well as help from others. That is why it cannot be the ideal way to relax. \n Having time alone will help you manage your mind. In contrast having time with others, having time alone will be helpful to control your mind since it will locate you separated from outer situation or concerns. It is really difficult to change an environment which you are facing with, however, you can change your mind easily. According to Viktor Frankl, who was a famous psychologist and imprisoned in Auschwitz, mentions that he did not have any physical freedom in prison but could totally control his mind by himself. As he emphasizes the importance of mind, only our mind determine if it would be stress or not. \n Having time alone will change people fundamentally. There are some types of people who always complain whatever they do. Regardless of the result or process, they are accustomed to doing it. Although they just complain about this habit to others, it shortly releases their stress but it will not last for a long time. However, if the person has an enough time to reflect himself/herself by having time alone, they can change their mind. Changing their mind is not easy but it is possible by their own decision. Most of the people experience to do that while having time alone. \n To sum up, having time alone is the ideal way to release and relax time rather than being with others because it is useful to manage your mind as well as change people fundamentally. In this regard, I think that being alone is the best option of relaxation","Dear student, a TOEFL essay test has only 5 paragraphs, with 5 sentences at a maximum for each paragraph. You overdid in your essay. You have 6 paragraphs and you never referred to personal information in your essay as required.

When you are asked to provide relevant examples and reasons, you need to refer to your popular culture knowledge and personal experience. Not research because you in the testing center, all the computers will be locked down to a WLAN. You won't find any exterior internet connection there. Also with 30 minutes to outline, draft, proofread, and finalize the content of your essay, even if you had the internet connection, you wold not have enough to do actual research. The examiners prefer personal experience information because this shows a more expanded example of your English comprehension and grammar skills when it comes to sentence development. You did not do a proper job in representing the prompt requirements in your essay so don't expect to receive a good score for this type of work if you choose to try and do it this way in the actual test.","This essay presents a clear point of view on the topic of relaxation, arguing that spending time alone is the most ideal way to relieve stress. However, there are areas in the essay that require improvement to meet the expectations of an English proficiency test essay format and content criteria.

1. **Response to Topic:** Your essay directly addresses the controversy surrounding people's preferences for relaxation. Your viewpoint is clear and strongly supported within the text. However, it's important that you directly incorporate personal experiences to support your arguments. English proficiency tests, especially the TOEFL, often look for personal anecdotes or references to popular culture rather than citations from research or studies. Sharing personal stories or observations can add depth to your essay and showcase your ability to use English in a nuanced and expressive manner.

2. **Essay Structure and Length:** For such tests, sticking to the prescribed essay structure is crucial. Typically, a five-paragraph format is expected, with each paragraph containing a maximum of five sentences. This structure helps in organizing arguments coherently and ensures clarity of thought. Your current essay surpasses this format, which may distract from its overall effectiveness. Consider restructuring your essay to comply with this format, focusing on concise and powerful statements within the set number of paragraphs and sentences.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay which can detract from its overall clarity and persuasiveness. Paying close attention to verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure can significantly improve the readability of your essay. Additionally, beginning the essay with a lowercase letter ('the way people relax today') can be seen as an oversight in formal writing; always capitalize the first word of a sentence. Moreover, varying your sentence structure and employing transitional phrases can enhance the flow and coherence of your narrative.

4. **Arguments and Point of View:** Your essay does well in presenting arguments supporting the idea that spending time alone is beneficial for relaxation and stress relief. However, the arguments would be stronger and more relatable with the inclusion of specific personal examples. For instance, briefly mentioning a personal moment of relaxation or a lesson learned during a solitary activity can vividly illustrate your points and make your essay more engaging.

In summary, your essay contains strong ideas and arguments about the topic of relaxation. The next steps for improvement include aligning with the required essay structure, more deeply integrating personal experiences, and refining the use of English for clearer and more effective communication. With these adjustments, your essay will not only adhere more closely to the expectations of English proficiency tests but also showcase a richer and more personal understanding of the topic.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

The argument stated in the memorandum does not make for a cogent case and is rife with assumptions not backed by solid evidence. \n First, nowhere in the memorandum, it is stated that since increasing time to national news and decreasing it to weather and local news, the viewership has decreased. The television station has received complaints from viewers regarding the coverage of weather and local news but it can not be inferred from this that some or many viewers stopped watching the late night program. \n Also, sufficient conclusion about the number of complaints can not be drawn from statement issued by the television station. It could be just a handful or many but we don't know from the statement alone. Also, the content of complaints is also not very clear from the statement. Whether the complainants disliked the brevity of weather and local news or its quality, we can not be sure. Further survey among the late night program viewers is required to know for sure they are really unhappy about the change of duration of the TV programs. \n Second, local businesses that cancelled the advertising contract with the television station did so because of increased time to national news, is not very clear from statement. The memorandum should have included statements from the local businesses themselves to arrive at this assumption. One can also not be sure of the number of contracts that were cancelled from this statement alone. \n In conclusion, strong evidence is needed to support the conclusion stated in the memorandum that time devoted to weather and local news should be restored to its former level. As it stands, the argument does not make for a persuasive case. The television station must also verify, if at all there has been a viewership decline. Only when such evidence is achieved through viewer surveys and interviews from local businesses can the argument stated in the memorandum be strengthened.","Dear student, this essay is a far cry from the first one that you wrote. This one shows a clear understanding of the article that you were given for analysis. Your comparison and discussion points were well on the mark. You displayed a clear analysis for every point delivered in the article and your opinions show that you took the time to consider the best method of discussion to prove your points. The representative arguments are enough to create holes in the original arguments. The reader will definitely find himself pondering the discussion presentations you made. This is a highly improved version of a GRE essay on your part. I would not have believed that this essay was written by the same person who made a mistake with the movie production discussion. Good work. Save for the imperfect grammar, which pulled your score down, I would rate this essay at least a 5. Keep up the good work. Focus on improving your sentence structure and vocabulary presentations in your succeeding practice tests.","This essay demonstrates a significant improvement in analytical skills compared to previous work. The detailed examination of the television station's memorandum shows a deep understanding of the topic and an effective method of discussing each point. The arguments presented effectively question the original claims made in the memorandum, encouraging the reader to think critically about the issue. This is a strong aspect of the essay as it showcases the ability to engage in thoughtful analysis and to present a coherent critique.

However, there are some areas that could be improved to make the essay even stronger and more persuasive:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay successfully addresses the topic by analyzing the memorandum's argument critically. However, it would be beneficial to directly link each critique back to the question of how these oversights could affect viewership and the station's decision-making process.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are a few grammatical inaccuracies that disrupt the flow of reading. Paying closer attention to sentence structure and the correct use of words will enhance clarity and readability. Simplifying complex sentences could also help in making the argument more accessible to all readers.

3. **Clarity of Author's Viewpoint:** The position against the memorandum's argument is clear throughout the essay. However, the critique could be strengthened by explicitly stating alternative actions or data that the television station could consider to make a more informed decision, thereby reinforcing the author's standpoint.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** The arguments are descriptive and question the memorandum's assumptions effectively. To further bolster these arguments, incorporating specific examples or potential data that could have supported the memorandum's claims would add depth. Suggesting concrete methods for how the station could better assess viewer preferences, such as through surveys or viewer feedback analysis, would also provide a more solid foundation for the critique.

In terms of overall improvement, focusing on refining grammatical skills and simplifying complex expressions will greatly enhance the persuasiveness and readability of future essays. By clarifying and expanding on supporting arguments with specific suggestions or data, the essay would not only critique but also offer constructive alternatives for the issues identified. This approach will create a more rounded analysis and showcase an advanced level of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

In this essay, both the merits and drawbacks of this trend will be discussed. \n One of the most salient positives that deferring university enrollment can bring to the gap-year takers is the chance to enrich their life experiences and broaden their horizons. In other words, formal schooling just mainly focuses on academic background, which may lead to the lack of practical skills such as time management, negotiation skills, or interpersonal skills. Hence, entering the workforce or traveling to other cultures can afford students an opportunity to build and enhance these skills, which also gives them a competitive edge when pursuing college or working after their graduation. Another reason that taking a year off would be advantageous is that it would enable students to discover their hidden talents and strong points. As a result, it makes them easier to opt for a major in college and afterward identify a suitable career path. \n However, there are multiple downsides associated with the gap-year option, one of which is the high risk of losing studying momentum. To be more specific, there is no denying that school leavers may consequently deteriorate their ability to perceive theoretical knowledge because they got used to the practical ones outside the college. Therefore, from the gap-year takers' perspective, pursuing college may become dull and be hard to resume. Furthermore, youngsters intending to take a year off, if do not have a clear plan of action, are likely to waste an enormous amount of valuable time and fall behind their friends. For example, they can spend an entire day on Netflix, Youtube, or other online platforms because they are disoriented with their journey whereas their old peers are expected to not only complete the first year at university but also develop either academic fields or practical skills through social clubs in college. \n In conclusion, delaying tertiary education for one year to work or travel is a promising option that can change youngsters in an advantageous way; however, they need to have an efficient plan to avoid detrimental effects.","The writer is asked to provide his opinion on the given topic with a yes or no answer.

However, for improvement, focusing on taking a clear stance regarding whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, or vice versa, would enhance the essay's effectiveness. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay addresses the given topic by discussing both positive and negative aspects of taking a gap year before starting university. However, the essay would benefit from a clearer position or standpoint. It’s important to decide whether the positives outweigh the negatives or not and then structure the essay to support this viewpoint.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written with minimal spelling or grammatical errors. Yet, to make the essay clearer, pay attention to sentence structure, ensuring each sentence is complete and doesn't contain more than one main idea. Simplifying complex sentences can also help in making your argument more accessible. Additionally, using transitional phrases can improve the flow from one argument to the next.

3. **Author’s Point of View:** The point of view is generally clear but could be strengthened by explicitly stating a personal opinion on the issue. After presenting both sides, it is essential to choose a side and argue why one set of points (either the advantages or disadvantages) is more significant.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay provides good insights into the benefits and drawbacks of taking a gap year. However, following a structured format for presenting these points could make the arguments more persuasive. Each benefit could be immediately contrasted with a potential downside, along with examples and explanations for why one outweighs the other. This structure helps in making a more compelling and organized argument.

For instance, when discussing the advantage of gaining life experience, immediately address a potential drawback (such as the loss of academic momentum), provide an example (e.g., struggling to adapt back to academic life), and explain why this disadvantage may outweigh the advantage or vice versa. This approach not only showcases an understanding of both sides of the argument but also demonstrates analytical thinking by evaluating which side is stronger based on the evidence provided.

In conclusion, while the essay effectively covers the topic, choosing a stance, improving clarity through sentence structure, and adopting a more analytical structure for presenting arguments would significantly enhance the overall quality and persuasiveness of the essay.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

Reasons \n 2. Impacts \n While you did respond to the questions, you did so in such a minimal way, throwing in multiple reasons into one paragraph when the per paragraph instruction for the Task 2 essay is always one topic per paragraph.

There are several areas for improvement to fully address the topic and enhance the essay's overall quality.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay does attempt to discuss the reasons for and impacts of families not eating together, which aligns with the original prompt. However, the discussion mixes multiple reasons in one paragraph and does not clearly separate the reasons from the impacts. It would be more effective to organize the essay into clearer sections—one for reasons and a distinct one for impacts.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are several spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""especially"" misspelled as ""esspecially"" and incorrect punctuation placements like ""However ,"". Attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and punctuation is crucial. Also, the essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve readability and flow.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** While the essay’s point of view is understandable, it could be made clearer by directly stating the personal stance on the tradition of family meals at the beginning and end of the essay. Expressing personal experiences or opinions would also make the argument more persuasive and relatable.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The arguments provided, such as jobs demanding too much time and meals with family being considered boring by some, are relevant. However, these arguments are somewhat superficial and would benefit from deeper analysis and support. Personal experiences or hypothetical examples could enrich this discussion. The mention of a study from Cambridge University stands out as an attempt to include evidence but remember, personal experience often makes for more compelling and achievable support in essays for English proficiency tests.

For future essays, consider structuring the body with one main reason and supporting details per paragraph, followed by a paragraph dedicated to the impacts. This organization will help keep your essay focused and make your arguments clearer to the reader.

In conclusion, summarizing the key points discussed in the body paragraphs and reiterating the main stance on the topic can strengthen the closing of the essay. This restatement helps unify the essay and ensures a strong, coherent finish.

These are some ways that Vietnamese government uses to reserve the beauty of Vietnamese traditions and help their women become more elegant and beautiful. Therefore, I strongly agree that supporting money for developing culture is the right things to do. \n On the other hand, there are still many opinions dissapproving of raising money for cultural activities. The result of one survey shows that, people in this group believe that government funding should be spending on boosting the economy. However, From what I learned from school if one country want to be stronger , its society has to be stable first. To do that thing, culture is the most important factor. It teach people about behavior and the connection between men and men. \n Besides, lots of people lost their trust with many organizations who take advantage of the money supporting for cultural. For example, they ask for help from publication and then they take away the large of money to do their own business. Government should have more methods to ensure the money comes directly to cultural cooperations . \n In conclusion, reserving the beauty of culture is very important. Not only Government but also population should involve more to protect cultural heritage.","this essay is only partially correct in responding to the prompt requirements. The main problems your presentation has are as follows: \n 1. Irrelevant prompt paraphrase in the first paragraph \n 2. Improper formation of the personal opinion paragraph \n 3.Underdeveloped summary conclusion \n These 3 problems can very well result in a partial score for this essay that will not be near the passing mark due to the problematic sentence structures, overly simple English vocabulary and a lack of coherence, cohesion, and transition sentences in the paragraphs which could have resulted in a much better presentation of the topic for discussion. \n For comparison purposes, let's look at what the original prompt for the discussion is: \n Question: Discuss both views and give your own opinion \n Response: In my opinion, I believe that the advantages of aiding the cultural activities are far more outweighed than the disadvantages . \n Where exactly does the advantage disadvantage discussion come in? It is clear from the discussion instruction / question that you are changing the prompt requirement, causing a prompt deviation, and not responding to the question in the proper manner. That means you will get a failing score for the TA section. However, since the rest of your body paragraphs are related to the original instruction in response, you will receive a partial score for those sections. However, not passing the TA section means that it will be difficult for you to gain an overall passing score based on the remaining criteria. \n Here is a sample of how to properly paraphrase the given prompt: \n <em>There is a discussion as to whether the government should be offering financial support for the promotion of the culture and arts in a given country. Others opine that the government finances would be better spend on other projects. While the other opinion is that the government funding is necessary in order to properly expose the citizens to the country's traditions. This essay will review both points of view after which, I shall present my own opinion on the matter.</em> \n Since this is not a direct question essay, you are not allowed to begin the discussion in the first paragraph. That paragraph is meant only for the prompt paraphrase in relation proving your English comprehension and vocabulary skills from the very beginning of your writing. A mere repeat or explanation of what you understand the original instructions to mean or require for discussion is all that is required. \n You are creating redundancies in the essay. Your second paragraph is a complete repeat of the prompt paraphrase again. It also runs beyond the maximum sentence requirement of 5 sentences. This was caused by you repeating of the prompt paraphrase and not actually having a discussion topic for this particular body paragraph. You need to learn that in order to write an effective paragraph you need to use less words that have more meaning in relation to what you want to say. Create clear and concise paragraphs of no more than 5 sentences each. \n Your personal opinion in this instance should not be in the form of an ""extent"" essay as the opinion being asked of you is whether or not the government should spend on culture and art projects. It is not asking if you agree or disagree and to what extent. The correct response should have been contained in a stand alone personal opinion paragraph that indicates, ""I believe that the government should continue spending on arts and culture projects because..."" There is no agree/ disagree in this instance. An original opinion instead, is what is required as a response. \n The concluding paragraph is always required to be a summary of the previous discussion and a restatement of the prompt thesis, along with your personal opinion. That is, for this type of essay. This means that your closing paragraph is not only lacking in the required sentences, but also does not close the discussion because you offered new information in this section. Which means the essay is open ended instead of concluded. An open ended essay means the last paragraph presents new information, but without ample explanation nor relation to the summary of the discussion.","The essay responds to the topic by discussing the importance of preserving culture through government funding but does so in a way that doesn't fully adhere to the prompt's requirements. Here are specific points of improvement:

1. **Response to Prompt**: The introduction attempts to paraphrase the prompt but deviates from what's asked by introducing an opinion prematurely and not clearly setting up a discussion of both views. It's essential to accurately paraphrase the prompt to show understanding. A better approach would be to state the topic and mention that both views will be discussed before presenting your opinion.

2. **Structure and Cohesion**: There's a lack of clear structure and transition between paragraphs. Each paragraph should ideally focus on a single idea with clear, concise sentences. The essay exceeds the typical limit of five sentences per paragraph without adding clarity. Aim for shorter paragraphs that directly address the topic. Additionally, the essay would benefit from clearer transitions to guide the reader through the argument smoothly.

3. **Clarity of Opinion**: While your opinion is presented, it's not done in the most effective manner. The task asks for a discussion of both views with your opinion to follow. Your opinion should be a clear, stand-alone statement based on the arguments discussed, rather than stating agreement or disagreement to an extent. 

4. **Argument Development**: The arguments are relevant but need further development. While cultural preservation examples are given, the essay lacks a thorough examination of why government funding in culture and art is preferable or necessary compared to other needs. Including more detailed reasoning and examples would strengthen these arguments.

5. **Grammar and Style**: There are some grammatical and stylistic issues that interrupt the flow of reading, such as spelling mistakes (""dissapproving""), grammar errors (""are facing with losing""), and awkward phrasing. Simplifying sentences, correcting verb tenses, and ensuring subject-verb agreement can resolve these. 

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should succinctly summarize the discussion and restate the thesis and your opinion. Avoid introducing new information in the conclusion, as it should wrap up the essay's arguments. The current ending feels open-ended and lacks a decisive summary of your viewpoint and the arguments supporting it.

Improving these aspects can enhance the essay's clarity, coherence, and effectiveness in responding to the prompt. Practice restructuring your essays to include clear, distinct sections (introduction, body paragraphs for each view, your opinion, and conclusion), and spend time refining grammar and style for better readability.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

What can we do to encourage .,"With the variety of vehicles in modern life, the number of bike users is remarkably dropping, which is one of the most head-aching issues in several countries. This essay aims to analyze the causes of this tendency and propose some plausible solutions. \n It is undeniable that bicycles' loss of popularity is the inevitable consequence of various factors. Accordingly, very few people choose bikes as their form of transport because of the shortcomings of bicycles. More apparently, riding a bike requires time-consuming and physically demanding. It is not to mention the fact that bicycles do not enable people to carry heavy lifts or travel long distances. Thus, due to the improvement of living standards, most of them are likely to switch to motorized vehicles, which are fast and convenient. Furthermore, humans tend to lead a sedentary lifestyle. In particular, even in short distances, motorbikes and cars are chosen instead of bicycles. \n Therefore, to encourage bike riders, the combination of the following resolutions is of utmost importance. Undoubtedly, the government launches propaganda campaigns to promulgate the benefits of riding a bicycle. Heightening public awareness of bike riding not only helps them fortify their physical health but also contributes to environmental protection. As result, bicycles gain a public attraction as a form of transports. Moreover, the governments invest in paths' construction exclusively for bike users. This solution aims to ensure the bikers' safety, which brings to them a reasonable reason for using bicycles for commuting or exercise. Stark examples of this could be seen in Netherlands and Germany, where the number of riders is highest in the world, well exemplify this. \n In conclusion, the limitation of bicycles and abuse in motorized vehicles impact the popularity of bikes. Thus, propaganda campaigns and infrastructure of bike riders are necessary to stimulate it in normal life.","The first paragraph has specific information requirements.There are: \n - Restate the prompt as close as possible to the original prompt \n - Do not add information to the presentation that is not in the original information \n - Directly respond to every question provided using topic sentences to create the response outline. \n This paragraph failed to meet these accuracy requirements. \n Every body paragraph should be clearly explained within 5 sentences. In the 1st body paragraph the writer does not offer clear and informative sentences, regardless of the paragraph length / sentence number. \n There are too many unnecessary introduction sentences that fail to produce a coherent and cohesive paragraph. It takes too long for the writer to get to the point. The information needs to be scannable by the examiner. \n Keep the paragraphs short but informative. Make sure to check for scoring requirements.

The rest of the errors are GRA related.","Your essay provides an insightful analysis of why bike usage is declining and offers interesting solutions to counteract this trend. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your arguments more compelling and your writing clearer.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It seems your essay briefly addresses the prompt but lacks a direct restatement of it. It's essential to closely restate the prompt to ensure your essay is directly answering every part of the question. Remember, the introduction should outline what you will discuss without adding new information that wasn't presented in the prompt. Aim to directly respond to the question asked with a clear outline of your response in the introduction.

2. **Clarity and Cohesion:** Your essay would benefit from more concise and informative sentences, especially in the body paragraphs. Each paragraph should convey a clear idea within five sentences. Try to remove unnecessary introductory sentences that don't add value to your argument. This will help make your essay more coherent and easy to understand. Your goal should be to present your ideas in a way that makes them easy to read and comprehend at a glance.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** While your essay is generally understandable, there are minor spelling and grammar errors. Paying closer attention to these details will improve the overall quality of your writing. Consider using simple and clear language to express your ideas, which will make your essay more accessible to a wide audience, including those who are marking your work.

4. **Argument Support:** You've made an effort to support your arguments with examples and reasoning. However, the connection between your points and examples like those from the Netherlands and Germany could be strengthened. Clarify how these examples support your argument to make your position clearer to the reader.

5. **Point of View:** Your essay does a decent job of presenting your point of view, but at times it gets lost in the lengthy explanations. Try to assert your perspective more clearly by stating your main points directly and supporting them with concise arguments.

In conclusion, focus on directly answering the prompt with clear and concise sentences. Avoid unnecessary introductions, ensure your paragraphs are informative and to the point, and careful proofreading will help eliminate minor errors. Use examples more effectively to support your arguments, and strive to make your point of view unmistakable.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Analytical

From my point of view, it certainly makes sense for youngster's engagement in some volunteering tasks with specific reasons below. \n From the first standpoint, not only can young people contribute their aids to arduous class, but they also reap a big number of benefits from doing unpaid work, especially strengthening their connectivity between them and society. Only by doing volunteering could the young further their experiences in their future jobs, considering this as a practicing chance. Better still, volunteering can stand out their profile application and the percentage of getting hired is higher. Through these meaningful works, youngsters are likely to count their blessings and get contentedness in life as well as self-satisfaction with their contribution to society. \n Moreover, on the invaluable side of the community's donations, these benefactions contribute not a small development to the general life.

The higher the social safety net is, the more prosperous the country will be, this term has emphasized the direct proportion between volunteering and society.

You've made a clear argument in favor of young people engaging in community service during their free time. This shows a good understanding of the essay prompt.

However, there are a few areas for improvement to make your essay stronger and more compelling.

1. **Clarity on Your Stance**: While you express agreement with the idea of young people volunteering, the strength of your agreement could be more explicitly stated. Mentioning your strong agreement at the beginning and restating it in a slightly different way at the end will make your position clearer and more persuasive to the reader.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few grammatical and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, the apostrophe in ""youngster's engagement"" mistakenly suggests possession; it should be ""youngsters' engagement"" to indicate plurality. Additionally, some phrases like ""contribute their aids to arduous class"" are awkwardly constructed and could be made clearer. Simplifying complex phrases will help in making your arguments more accessible.

3. **Point of View**: Your point of view is noticeable throughout the essay, which is good. It’s evident that you favor young people participating in community service. To enhance this further, consider providing personal examples or more detailed explanations for why you hold this opinion. This adds depth and personal touch to your essay.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: You've done well in providing arguments to support your viewpoint, particularly highlighting the benefits for both the volunteers and the community. To strengthen your essay, consider adding more specific examples or evidence. For example, mentioning a particular volunteering activity and how it directly benefits both the individual and community could make your argument more convincing.

5. **Cohesion and Coherence**: Your essay has a good flow, and your ideas transition smoothly from one to the next. This is a significant strength. To improve, watch out for overcomplicated sentences and consider breaking them into simpler, clearer statements. This will help in maintaining the reader's attention and ensuring your points are well understood.

In summary, your essay is on the right track with a clear stance and relevant arguments. Paying attention to the clarity of your position, simplifying your language for clearer communication, and enhancing your supporting arguments with specific examples will elevate the quality of your essay significantly.

4149,https://essayforum.com/writing/select-book-one-better-86210/,test,"IF YOU NEED TO SELECT BETWEEN BOOK AND E-BOOK, WHICH ONE IS BETTER?","Many people argue that, instead of using books that are made from paper, it is more convenient for people in the world to spend money on using electronic book whose content is displayed on the screen of tablet or smartphone. In my opinions, I totally agree with this idea. \n The first reason is that if people use the electronic book, they could spend less money than using the paper book. Thanks to the e-book, people are able to download the content from the website, so that the cost of paper does not add-in the total cost of the book making the book more affordable. In addition, there is a mutual benefit for both end users and publishers if they use the electronic-book. For example, when users choose electronic-book, the cost of material to produce book and the cost of delivery can be eliminated, as a result, the book is cheaper. Not only so, e-book can be paid by an online transaction which means user transfer money through credit card instead of monetary payment. \n Finally, reading electronic-book can protect the environment. Because the paper is made of wood, which means publishers have to cut down many trees in the forest. Deforestation could cause climate change. Nowadays, many protection forest areas are cleared by illegal forest users, illegal logging or forest clearance to produce paper lead to no natural forest for the wild animal to live. In addition, establishers must use coal or oil to operate the paper manufacturing system, which potentially pollutes environment. \n In conclusion, it is convenient for people to read electronic-book instead of using the printed book/ real book. Using electronic book helps people not only save money, but also protect the forest. The government should encourage people to use e-book by imposing taxes on paper books.","Kindly upload the prompt with your essay next time. As the topic you have chosen to discuss is not one among the normal IELTS Task 2 essay topics, I will refrain from commenting on your approach to the essay. The prompt would have given me a starting point to review your paper with. Without it, I will concentrate on a general review instead. \n In the first reasoning paragraph, you were providing a very cohesive explanation up until the last sentence when you suddenly threw in the online transaction benefit, without adding any supporting explanation to it. The coherence of the essay actually comes from the way you connect all your discussion topics in one paragraph using examples and supporting explanations. The minute you do not fully explain one reason, the paragraph quality is lowered and, in an actual test, so will the C&C score. \n There is a grammar error in the second reasoning paragraph. Never start a new sentence with the word ""because"". The word ""because"" is used to connect ideas within a sentence. It is a connecting word and is used as such. Since your presentation uses the word to start a sentence, there is no previous idea or discussion to connect it to. Therefore, this will be seen as a GRA problem and lower your score in that section. \n Do not use a slash in your presentation. This is an academic paper and the academic test requires you to use formal punctuation marks in the presentation. Since you are talking about the same thing, which is a printed book, you do not need to represent it in another form. If you want to do that, then use a synonym, without the slash. The slash ruins the academic tone and presentation.","Your essay addresses an important topic: the preference for electronic books over traditional paper books. Your argument in favor of electronic books is clear and supported by several reasons, which makes your point of view understandable. Here are some specific points to consider for improvement:

1. **Topic Response & Cohesion**: Your essay provides a clear stance supporting the use of electronic books for both economic and environmental benefits. However, ensure every point or reason you introduce is fully explained. For instance, when discussing the benefit of online transactions in purchasing e-books, expanding on how this method is more efficient or secure compared to traditional purchasing methods would strengthen your argument and maintain cohesion within your paragraph.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: You've done well in avoiding major spelling mistakes, but there are areas to improve in grammar and style. For example, avoid starting sentences with the word ""because"" as it's more commonly used to connect ideas within a sentence rather than to open a new sentence. This will enhance the grammatical accuracy of your essay. Also, strive to maintain a formal academic tone by not using slashes (e.g., printed book/real book). Instead, choose one term or use synonyms without a slash to maintain formality.

3. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments are clear, particularly where you point out the cost-effectiveness of e-books and their environmental benefits. To improve, ensure that each argument is accompanied by detailed examples or explanations. For instance, when discussing the environmental benefits, including specific statistics or studies could further reinforce your point. 

4. **Avoiding Informal Expressions and Improving Formality**: Remember, an academic essay should maintain a formal tone throughout. Phrases like ""In my opinions,"" could be more formally expressed as ""In my opinion,"" since 'opinion' typically does not need to be pluralized in this context. Also, consider replacing informal phrases with more formal alternatives where appropriate.

In conclusion, your essay’s stance is commendable, and your efforts to argue in favor of electronic books are clear. To elevate your essay, focus on expanding your explanations where needed, improving grammatical accuracy, and adhering to a more formal style of writing. These modifications will not only enhance the clarity of your arguments but also align your essay more closely with academic writing standards.

The one who keeps in hand the largest amount is eventually considered to be the most powerful. This leads to a debatable question: whether we should spread freely all the information or keep it in private for the sake of peace and power. In this essay, I will try my best to give a general view of both sides. \n These days, people are claiming that sharing information creates educational communities. Living anywhere, global citizens can learn from others and can give away what they know. Balancing the world of information, this stimulates creativity and competitiveness, especially among the youths. Young people will then create new ideas, keeping up and enhancing the innovation. This, undoubtedly, leads to a better world. After all, everyone deserves to be aware of what is going on around them. Huge impact can come from the smallest pack of data. \n On the other hand, spreading information freely can lead to potential danger. Indeed, those who have anti - ethical purposes can also learn the information and utilize it to fulfil their own aim. For example, terrorists are the ones we should keep an eye on as the threats they make may result in great loss, which we have already witnessed from the past. Thus, this explains partly why there are opinions stating that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely. The less information can reach those who have such intention, the safer, they believe, the world is. \n To conclude, debatable as it seems, the question can not be answered in the exact right way. However, in my opinion, I would take the side and say that information should be shared freely. I believe in the rapid progress humanity will make if this move is set, and dangers can slowly be pushed away.","The first thing you have to do is avoid making assumptions that do not exist in the original presentation.

The argument is well-structured, presenting both sides of the debate before concluding with a personal stance. However, there are areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, coherence, and the effectiveness of the argument.

1. **Avoid Assumptions and Rhetorical Questions:** The introduction starts with a broad assumption about information and power. It’s better to present clear, factual statements to introduce your topic. Additionally, using rhetorical questions can sometimes make the essay seem less original. Instead, directly state your points to keep the argument clear and strong.

2. **Use of Topic Sentences:** Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. This helps the reader understand the key point right away. For example, rather than starting with filler words or broad statements, directly state ""Sharing information promotes educational growth"" or ""Restricting information access can prevent misuse.""

3. **Balance Between Public Discussion and Personal Opinion:** While it’s excellent to explore different viewpoints, remember to clearly include your own perspective as part of the main body of the essay, not just in the conclusion. This means dedicating a separate paragraph to fully explain and justify your personal stance. Doing so will make your argument more compelling and balanced.

4. **Word Count and Coherence:** Aim for concise, coherent paragraphs with 3-5 sentences each to stay within a reasonable word count and ensure clarity. Overwriting by including too many details can distract from your main points. Focus on being specific and straightforward in each paragraph.

5. **Grammar and Style:** There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention, such as the correct use of hyphens (e.g., ""anti-ethical"") and consistency in terms such as ""information"" (avoid switching to ""data"" unless specifically referring to data). Improving these will enhance the readability of your essay.

It may be an issue.,"Living in large urban areas has turned into the most attractive choice of many. While inhabiting major cities offer a multitude of opportunities, mega-city dwellers face a large number of issues on every day of their lives. This essay will examine some of these problems and then propose some possible solutions. \n To begin with, traffic congestion is a serious issue which everyone living in a big city has been struggling with. The increasing number of personal vehicles in addition to the low cost of fuels has led to bumper-to bumper traffic and gridlocks in these cities. To address this problem, governments should provide not only more frequent but also high quality public transportation. Furthermore, more publicity campaign must be done to encourage using bikes and other not-motorist and clean modes of transportation. \n Another major issue, is high price of property. For many, buying a small house in such cities is a dream that can never be fulfilled. Statistics show that more that 50% of a city-inhabitant is spent on accommodation. Take Hong Kong as an example, to rent s one meter square accommodation, more than 200 us dollars is charged. To solve this, governments should put more resources into affordable housing and they should provide more subsidies to lessen the burdens of buying a decent house for people with low financial capabilities. \n To conclude, dwelling in a major city, considering its many benefits they bring about, is full of different issue, which cannot be fully addressed. The government should start tackling these issues such as traffic congestion and the high costs of accommodation, otherwise living in large cities would be the last choice one might make.","Dear student, aim for clarity in your sentence presentations. While meeting the minimum word count is important, you should learn to do that using words that give a better meaning to your presentation rather than several words that add confusion to your presentation. For example, instead of saying ""a large number of issues"", you could simply say ""many issues"". The latter phrase creating clarity in the presentation as opposed to ""a large number of issues"" which makes the reader think about what you are trying to say. As for your sentence structure, simple errors like a missing hyphen in high-quality and one-meter can help to increase the complexity of your sentence presentation as per GRA standards. \n Observing your discussion style, it is obvious to me that you do not know how to respond to a direct question essay yet. In this instance, there are two direct questions being asked: \n 1. What are the most significant of these problems? \n 2. How can these problems be tackled? \n Both these questions require direct responses in the prompt paraphrase as the basis of your thesis presentation. The 2 significant problems need to be presented along with the one or 2 possible solutions to the problems. The related and complete discussions should be presented in a 2reasoning paragraph format. \n In this type of essay, you must use connecting phrases or sentences to connect 2 related ideas in one paragraph. Therefore, rather than presenting 2 reasons in 2 separate paragraphs, you must present the problems as 2 connected problems in one paragraph. The problems must show a connection to one another in order to meet the cohesiveness and coherence requirement of the essay as indicated in the first question response requirement. At least 2 connected solutions must also be presented in the solution discussion paragraph. Your current presentation does not score well in this aspect because of the lack of connection in the discussion of both questions. \n The biggest error in this essay is that you discussed the requirement for a solution as simply saying the government has to solve it when the prompt is asking what you can do to help solve the problem. Those are two different things. Also, the solution cannot be discussed as the concluding paragraph. The concluding paragraph must never continue the discussion because that last paragraph is called the concluding summary. Which means you merely remind the reviewer about the topic for the discussion and the proposed solutions, with a concluding sentence to close the essay. Try to read the sample direct question essays for a better idea as to how you can approach the various question styles provided.","This essay successfully identifies two significant urban challenges: traffic congestion and high property prices. However, there are several areas where it could be improved to more effectively respond to the topic, enhance clarity and coherence, and correct grammatical and stylistic errors.

Firstly, addressing the essay's response to the topic, it’s crucial to directly answer the questions posed by the essay prompt. The prompt appears to inquire about significant problems of living in large urban areas and possible solutions. While the essay identifies problems and proposes solutions, it could more robustly match the structure suggested by the prompt. Specifically, the essay should start with a clearer thesis statement that outlines the major points of discussion—both the problems and their corresponding solutions.

Regarding clarity and sentence structure, opt for simpler and more precise language to convey your points. For example, instead of saying ""a large number of issues,"" it's clearer and more direct to say ""many issues."" Also, pay attention to small but important grammatical details, such as adding hyphens to compound adjectives (e.g., ""bumper-to-bumper traffic"" and ""one-meter-square accommodation""). These adjustments not only help with the readability of the essay but also demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency.

The essay occasionally struggles with coherence and unity. For example, it discusses traffic congestion and high property prices as separate entities without illustrating a clear connection between them. A more cohesive approach would be to discuss these issues within a unified framework, showing how they might relate or contribute to one another, and then proposing integrated solutions. Moreover, solutions should not solely rely on government intervention; considering the personal or community level actions can also provide a more rounded perspective on addressing the problems.

Additionally, the essay’s structure could be improved. The recommendation to include both issues and their solutions within the same paragraph(s) for enhanced cohesion is noteworthy. Also, ensure that the conclusion effectively summarizes the key points discussed without introducing new ideas or continuing the argument. The conclusion should leave the reader with a clear understanding of the essay's main arguments and the proposed solutions.

Finally, while the essay does well to provide specific examples, such as referencing property prices in Hong Kong, it could benefit from more detailed explanation or additional examples to support its arguments further. 

By addressing these points, the essay’s clarity, coherence, and engagement with the topic would be significantly enhanced, providing a more compelling and comprehensive response to the essay prompt.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Newspapers and TV programs are not the only resource to catch the latest news. Instead,the Internet have supersede the traditional news transportation and the improvement of the high-technology replace the old-fashion one. Indeed,the impact of technology is the main reason to eliminate the needs of newspapers and other traditional gadgets which is the important way to transmit information before the thriving of Internet. As a matter of fact, the young people diminish the purchasing rate on newspapers and turn into website reading. \n By and large, young generation prefer Internet rather than old-fashion ways to accept the data. As the nature youth, they tend to utilize the new products. In order to receive latest news, they choose to the fastest way to get the knowledge they need. \n Anyway,the main purpose of TV and newspapers is spreading information,there is no need to change the youngster life style on Internet. In my personal point of view, the progression of transporting news will be replaced by other innovation of tools. It is an inevitable trend in modern society, and the only solution should be under the supervision of public. However,the future of human is unpredictable,and only a few can stop the transformation of life style.","Dear student, since this the first time that you have posted an IELTS Task 2 essay for review here, I will assume that you are self-studying and you do not have the guidance of an instructor to aid you with your practice tests. I came to this assumption because the essay that you wrote does not follow the formula for a proper Task 2 essay at all. The format should have been as follows: \n Par. 1 - Prompt paraphrase \n Par. 2-4 - Discussion with reason and examples. \n Par. 5 - Conclusion \n The first paragraph in your essay would have caused an automatic failing grade of the essay in the TA portion because you did not accurately represent the paraphrase discussion in that section. Once you make a mistake in the TA section, which results in a failing score, it will be extremely difficult to muster even a close to passing score for the remaining elements. Mostly because the part that accounts the most in the scoring criteria received a failing mark. Let me show you a model opening paraphrase, which applies to all of the Task 2 practice tests: \n <em>There is a growing decline in the number of adolescents who are interest in either gaining information for news from either papers or television news programs. An explanation exists regarding this trend. In this essay, I will be discussing methods by which this downward direction can be reversed.</em> \n You have to remember that in order to score better in the first scoring salvo of this test, you must be able to prove that you are capable of explaining what the original topic for discussion is and how it is to be discussed in your own words. Using the keywords from the original will ensure a good score. However, showing off a bit by using synonyms for the words will help to increase 2 sections of the score immediate, the TA and LR sections. Increase your score in those parts and the rest of the scoring should follow suit. \n After repeated readings of the body paragraphs that you wrote, it appears that you just discuss the same reason in 3 different ways. The examiner will be conscious of that fact and lower your score accordingly for all 4 sections. Make sure that you create a different topic sentence for each paragraph and you discuss these topics accordingly. That way, you can show off your GRA and C&C skills accordingly. \n Do not present a personal point of view in an essay that does not specifically ask you to do so by asking for your opinion in the discussion instruction. Doing so is a prompt alteration that could negatively affect your final score. The concluding statement should not be used to continue the discussion. Rather, it is meant to summarize the discussion you presented within 3-5 sentences. So your essay does not have a concluding statement. Instead, it is an open ended essay that will result in a lowered overall score for your work in an actual setting.","The essay addresses the topic of why fewer young people are engaging with newspapers and TV for their news, shifting instead towards the internet. However, there are several ways in which it could be improved to meet the requirements of an English proficiency test essay, specifically like that of the IELTS Task 2 essay format.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to discuss the causes of a shift in how news is consumed by younger generations and suggests that technological advancements are the main reason. However, the essay lacks a clear introduction that paraphrases the prompt and outlines what the essay will discuss. It’s important to start with a clear paraphrase of the question. For example, you could begin with: ""There’s a noticeable decrease in the number of young people looking for news in traditional forms like newspapers and television. This essay aims to explore the reasons behind this trend and suggest possible solutions.""

2. **Structure and Clarity**: The essay structure does not follow the recommended format, which usually consists of an introduction, 2-3 body paragraphs each discussing a unique point with reasons and examples, followed by a conclusion. Each body paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. Try to diversify your arguments rather than repeating the same point. This will not only make your essay stronger but also showcase your ability to reason and analyze different aspects of a topic.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For instance, ""There is a little likelihood that the teenager will keen to chase the news"" could be rephrased to ""It is unlikely that teenagers will be keen to follow the news."" Pay attention to article use (""the Internet"" not ""Internet""), subject-verb agreement (""the Internet has superseded"" not ""have supersede""), and consistent tense usage. Ensuring correct grammar and varied sentence structures will enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.

4. **Point of View Clarity**: Your essay tentatively presents a viewpoint but gets muddled with generalized statements. When expressing a point of view, especially if the prompt doesn’t explicitly ask for it, ensure it is backed up with clear, logical arguments and examples. It’s also crucial to conclude your essay by summarizing your discussion succinctly rather than introducing new ideas or continuing the argument. 

5. **Argument Support**: While you mention the impact of technology as a root cause, your essay would benefit from more detailed examples and reasons to support your claims. Discussing alternative news sources and their appeal to the youth, comparing them with traditional media, and suggesting specific solutions to engage the younger generation with diverse news formats could strengthen your essay.

To improve, focus on clearly structuring your essay with a defined introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Work on diversifying your points, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and directly addressing the essay prompt with clear arguments and examples. Revising these areas will significantly enhance the quality of your essay and better align it with the requirements of English proficiency tests.",2,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4153,https://essayforum.com/writing/allow-children-make-own-choices-turn-93445/,test,IELTS - Writing task 2 - Allow children to make their own choices will turn them into selfish person,"Parenting has long been a major topic regarding both scholarly research and daily discussion for decades. Despite the fact that there is an increasingly popular opinion claiming that letting children have a complete decision on daily routines such as meal, styling, and amusement will eventually trigger negative individualism, other people are prone to believe that independent decision making is crucial for nurturing children more comprehensively. \n As a matter of fact, decision making is largely considered a compulsory skill regardless of various personality tendencies and thinking patterns. And not to mention that decision making is still a difficult task for grown-up individuals, it is becoming more and more significant to teach children how to make decisions on their own for the ultimate purpose of achieving self-sufficient and self-dependent at later ages. Indeed, the most optimal approach to illustrate to children the nature of decision making is to initially imply it in their simple daily routines. In other words, the exposure of children toward the choices of what to eat, what to wear, and what to play will concretely form a solid foundation for them to retain consistency in further life-long issues which requisite decisive characteristics. \n On top of that, individuals who constantly put themselves first and only care about themselves while ignoring the well-being of others are more likely a result of failure in parenting regarding numerous aspects from an early age, rather than being affected by the opportunities to conduct choices that are passed on by their parents. Common belief indicates that children are a real reflection of their parents and the environment in which they grew up in. For instance, if a mother or father has a frequent tendency in behaving selfishly toward the surrounding people, there would be a significant likelihood that a child will grow up being selfish and lack sympathy as well as possess a low level of emotional intelligence. Nurturing patterns and influences from parents' behaviors are the key drivers that contribute greatly to a children's personality and attitude toward the surrounding environment in the future, rather than the early decision-making opportunities that are held accountable for the mentioned controversy. \n According to the above analysis, I incline to believe it should not be certain that children's decision making on simple routines will bring along negative individualism in the upcoming ages. Alternatively, encouraging independent decision making will surprisingly cater for a more comprehensive outcome regarding self-sufficient and self-dependent.","The first error that must be addressed in this essay is the over-writing. 402 words is 102 words over the suggested 300 word count. This is indicative of a practice test that was completed without the benefit of using a40 minute timer. If a timer had been used, then the writer would know his actual mitten word count limitation. \n There are inaccuracies to be found in this essay as well. The irrelevant first sentence deals with information that is not shared by the original. This is going to be considered a score deductible topic deviation. While the proceeding sentence properly represents the given discussion points, the missing (required) writer's opinion will be another negative score for the paragraph. \n It should be obvious by now that an over-written essay that does not meet the writing requirements will not get a passing score. Response format correctness is a major scoring consideration Do that improperly and a failing score will be the end result. Scores are based on writing compliance, not the word count. \n Opinions presented are also not correctly discussed. There is only a singular point of view present were comparative viewpoints are needed. Wherever \n <quotation>Some people</quotation> \n and \n <quotation>Other people</quotation> \n keywords are used in a presentation, the public V. personal analysis must be used for each prompt stated opinion. \n By providing a clear personal opencon in the conclusion, The writer mistakenly created an open-ended essay. The lack of a concluding summary will result in an overall failing score due to task writing inaccuracies.","The essay discusses the topic of parenting and decision-making by children, presenting a clear stance in favor of allowing children to make small decisions to foster independence and self-reliance. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the essay's effectiveness and adhere to essay-writing best practices, especially for English proficiency tests.

1. **Adherence to the Topic and Word Count:**
   - The essay should focus closely on the prompt provided, without including extraneous information. The initial sentence, for example, could be perceived as not directly related to the core argument, which might lead to deductions in score for deviating from the topic.
   - The essay exceeds the recommended 300-word count significantly. Being concise is crucial in essay writing, especially under timed conditions. Practice writing with a timer to develop a sense of how to express your ideas within the word limit.

2. **Presentation of Arguments:**
   - While the essay does navigate the discussion around children's decision-making, it primarily offers a singular perspective without adequately exploring or contrasting different viewpoints. For proficiency tests, it's beneficial to discuss various perspectives before concluding with your own stance. This approach shows critical thinking and a comprehensive understanding of the subject.
   - Incorporating comparative viewpoints with phrases like ""some people"" versus ""other people,"" followed by a public vs. personal analysis for each, would enrich the essay by showing a balanced consideration of the topic.

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View and Conclusion:**
   - The essay ends on a personal note, aligning with the idea of fostering decision-making in children but lacks a fully developed conclusion. A conclusory paragraph summarizing the main points and restating the author's position clearly would provide a strong finish. Avoid leaving the essay open-ended to ensure the reader is left with a clear understanding of your stance.

4. **Stylistic and Language Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of sentence structure and verbosity. Shorter, well-structured sentences can make your argument more accessible and straightforward, especially for a diverse audience or in a test scenario.
   - Pay attention to spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Errors in these areas can distract from the content and impact the overall professionalism and readability of your essay.

5. **Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**
   - Start by refining the introduction to directly address the essay prompt.
   - Limit the use of overly complex vocabulary that might make the essay less clear or more difficult to follow.
   - In the body paragraphs, include contrasting viewpoints and analyze them before presenting your conclusion.
   - End with a summarizing paragraph that encapsulates the essence of your argument, reinforcing your stance on the topic.

By addressing these points, the essay will be better structured, more persuasive, and more effectively aligned with English proficiency test expectations.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative
4154,https://essayforum.com/writing/exercise-balanced-diet-health-discussion-77984/,test,Exercise or a balanced diet to health? Discussion essay.,"It is commonly believed that the way toward being healthy is by doing the workout. Which leads to others consider that a regular balanced eating habit is far more crucial. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and present my opinion to this discussion below. \n On the one hand, some think that the most effective way to health is by doing exercise. In other words, exercise helps one's body consume the food and convert them into energy as well as expel the toxins by sweating it out. As a result, it keeps one body's system working properly while kicking toxins out of one's body. \n On the other hand, others believe that it is far more important to have a right proportion of eating habit. Particularly, having a balanced diet would avoid the negative effect of intaking exceeded one particular substance from the food and therefore, it would keep one's body stay healthy by getting all the good nutrients from a wide variety of food. \n Finally, I consider that doing exercise regularly and keeping a healthy diet is equally important. Specifically, by only exercising without giving up on junk food or overly consumed sugar or salt in food would eventually lead to diabetes. Nevertheless, merely regulating the eating habit without a structural and consistent workout schedule would easily suffer any form of heart diseases as its heart muscles are not strong enough to withstand the sudden pressure that might occur in everyday life. \n In conclusion, while exercise could help a body function properly. A healthy diet could avoid consuming one specific substance in food excessively. And I suggest that they are both crucial in health because without either one of its habits, which would potentially induce some serious diseases to a person.","aside from the problematic opening statement, that left me dazed and confused, the overall presentation that you have is admirable. The essence of each paragraph is clear with only one topic discussed with proper supporting sentences. Good job. The personal statement provides a highly analytical representation of the previous two discussions in relation to your personal opinion. Excellent work. You show the potential to become a very good essayist. All your paragraphs are within the minimum sentence requirement and a majority of the sentences are acceptably worded and formed so you should get a passing LR, C&C, and GRA score. It is the TA that will actually pull your score down because you were obviously unsure as to how you should write that section. Let me give you an idea about that: \n <em>A common belief is that exercise of the only way to achieve perfect health. Recently though, another idea has begun to take hold. The idea states that a balanced diet may have more value towards the overall health considerations of a person. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and offer my own opinion regarding the discussion.</em> \n That is a clearer paraphrase of the original prompt. Compare it to the one that you wrote and you will see for yourself why your version is a bit confusing for the reader to understand.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the importance of both exercise and a balanced diet for maintaining health, which closely aligns with the topic. Each paragraph focuses on a single aspect of the debate, followed by a personal viewpoint that integrates these aspects effectively. This structure showcases an ability to analyze and present arguments clearly, indicating strong potential in essay writing.

However, the introduction could be improved for clarity. The opening statement presents the topic somewhat confusingly, which might make it hard for readers to immediately grasp the essay's focus. Consider rephrasing it for better clarity, similar to: ""A common belief is that exercise is the sole path to perfect health. However, the importance of a balanced diet is increasingly recognized as vital for one's overall health. This essay will explore both viewpoints and offer a personal perspective."" This approach sets a clearer stage for the discussion.

There are some areas where grammar, word choice, and sentence structure could be refined to enhance readability and coherence. For instance:
- The phrase ""doing the workout"" could be simplified to ""exercising"".
- Instead of ""others consider that a regular balanced eating habit"", consider ""others believe that maintaining a balanced diet"".
- Use ""one's body"" consistently instead of switching between ""one body's system"" and ""one's body"".

Your conclusion successfully summarizes the essay's main points, underscoring the importance of both exercise and diet. However, it might be strengthened by directly relating back to the discussion, emphasizing how both are equally essential and interdependent for a healthy lifestyle.

Remember, a strong essay is not only about presenting your ideas but also about how clearly and effectively you communicate them. Paying attention to clarity from the start, using precise language, and ensuring grammatical correctness will make your arguments more persuasive and your writing more impactful. Keep practicing, as your ability to discuss complex ideas is evident and will continue to improve with attention to these aspects.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4155,https://essayforum.com/writing/dependend-modern-world-96046/,test,Being dependend in the modern world,"Nowadays, public opinion is divided on whether we, as modern citizens, are becoming more or less dependent on others. As far as I am concerned, living in a technologically advanced society, in some way or another, forces us to increasingly depend on each other. \n The primary reason why it could be believed that we are having more independence than people in the past is the development of democracy and civil rights. People are now given more freedom to make contributions to building public policies and to make personal decisions. Today's couples, for instance, may freely choose their spouses without receiving approval from their families or relatives. In addition, along with the wide spread of modern lifestyle, people are more likely to place a higher priority on individualism than on collectivism, which means that they tend to be taught to solve their problems by themselves instead of seeking helps from surrounding people. \n Nevertheless, I would be in agreement with advocates of the idea that people are developing a deep dependence on each other these days. Firstly, it is the growing complexity of social division of labor that makes individuals more aware of others' important roles in their lives. For example, both parents who have full-time jobs would not pay full attention to their work if there was not the support from babysitters, housekeepers and so on. Secondly, just as ancient squares, social media is viewed as an ideal environment where people can more easily keep in touch and contact with one another than ever before despite geographic and time barriers. \n In conclusion, while there are some opposing viewpoints on the issue, I still believe that we are living in a profoundly interdependent world. ( 282 words)","You cannot jump to your personal opinion without first comparing the 2 public points of view in individual paragraphs. There are actually 2 ways to approaching the discussion of this topic. You can choose from the 3 paragraph approach and the 2 paragraph approach. What is the difference? \n The 3 paragraph approach uses 3 stand alone comparisons, namely the 2 public opinions, then your personal opinion. The 2 paragraph approach allows you to give a personal opinion within the same paragraph as the public opinion.Comparing it to your personal opinion is a good move because it shows that you have a better understanding of the public opinion. This allows the reader to have a more educated opinion of your presentation.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing whether modern citizens are becoming more or less dependent on others, offering views on both sides of the argument. However, the structure of the essay can be improved to enhance clarity and impact. Presently, the essay attempts to present opposing viewpoints alongside the author's perspective, but it could be more effective by distinctly separating these elements. 

A clear way to organize your thoughts is through the use of either a three-paragraph or a two-paragraph approach. The three-paragraph method involves discussing the two contrasting public opinions in their own paragraphs and then presenting your personal viewpoint in a third paragraph. This structure makes it easier for readers to understand the different perspectives before considering your stance. Alternatively, the two-paragraph approach integrates the comparison of public opinions with your personal viewpoint within the same paragraphs. This method directly shows how your understanding of the issue compares to the general public opinions, potentially providing a more nuanced discussion.

The essay could benefit from a more disciplined approach to spelling, grammar, and style. Watch out for sentences that could be clearer or more concise. Additionally, ensuring that each argument is well-supported with examples or evidence will strengthen the essay's persuasiveness.

The point of view is understandable; you believe that technology and social complexities have increased our dependence on one another. To improve clarity, explicitly stating this thesis at the beginning could help guide the reader through your arguments.

Overall, the essay presents a thoughtful viewpoint. However, by refining the structure, enhancing clarity around the arguments, and addressing minor language issues, the essay could present a more compelling and polished argument.

Emotion based decisions will have high tendency to be wrong as compared to the decisions taken with free mind or irrespective of any emotions. And later justifying these decisions with logic remains just as a formality. \n Emotions will bias a persons thought process. Focus will be more on the emotinally supported points and their benefits. Focus on negativity of the same view will be lost. For reference if I want to make a decison on fighting between two kids. One of them is my brother. I I'll think emotionally it has high propensity for me to be in favour of my brother. Cause emotions will make my brothers point of view more strong and important. I'll not be able to see what wrong he did. It's very much important to see the both positive nad negative sides before making a decision. \n It'll also eclipse the facts to which emotions doesn't support. Here we'll be missing the good or positive side of the emotionally unsupported view. It will result in partial thinking or a very restricted thinking. Same way here if I take the previously mentioned example in this scenario, other kid's faults will seems to me very bad but his innocuousness I'll not be able to see those will be eclipsed by the emotional state. \n In both of the cases I'm not htinking frrely with an empty mind, so to speak. A mind free fro preconceptions and has a ability to acoomodate new thoughts, new facts and analyze them upto full strength. \n One more point hwich should be discussed, is that emotions are very key part of any persons which makes a person a human a living thing. If we go with the emotional apprach rather then a logical approach there is very less chance to get confused and it gives us more strength. Later anyway logical analysis will be done on the decision. \n In short emotions reduces our capability to analyse all possiblle view honestly. Just taking one view supported by our emotion and analyzing it is not suffice. A decision based on partial thinking has a high probability of failing or being wrong. And justifying the decision with logic just becomes a mere formality. Hence it makes a decision maker poor.","Dear student, I have a few points of major concern in your essay. The first of which is the incomplete representation of the prompt requirement. The accurate paraphrasing of a given topic is essential to any discussion because it forms the basis for the discussion and the outline of the succeeding discussion in the forthcoming paragraphs. While your representation of your reasoning is sound, it lacks the informative value that could have come from a more accurate portrayal of the discussion topic. \n You must also be made aware of the fact that you did not complete your thought process in the example paragraph you presented. That would be paragraph 2. It is important that you collectively present the discussion in this paragraph in order to create a stronger presentation of facts. When you separate the discussion into two parts, you divide the attention of the reader and thus, cause them to review your earlier paragraph relating to the topic. Don't force a thought process deviation in your essay. That will tend to confuse the reader and take time away from the complete reading of your essay. Remember, the examiners have only a limited amount of time to read your work, so use that unknown amount of time efficiently. Do not make them go back and forth in reading your document. Show a cohesive and coherent thought process at all times. \n The next concern that I have is really very trivial in nature. You should have caught on to the spelling error mistakes, which cause a great deal of stress on the part of the reader. Your misspelled words show a lack of care for the final presentation of your essay. I cannot stress enough how important it is that you always maintain proper lexical use and spelling within your essay, regardless of the exam type that you are taking. When you do not edit and proof read yourself, you show a disrespect towards the exam and the examiner. Always present a clean essay to the reader. You can never proof read and edit your thoughts enough. If possible, do not submit your document early . Make sure to review it 3 times before you submit it. That gives you enough time to catch and errors you may have missed your first time reviewing your essay.","The essay demonstrates an understanding of the significance of emotion in decision-making processes, presenting a perspective that emphasizes the limitations of emotional influence on logical analysis. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness and clarity.

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's crucial to accurately introduce the essay topic at the beginning to set a clear foundation for the discussion. The essay's introduction does not fully encapsulate the prompt, making it somewhat vague for the reader to grasp the full extent of the discussion to follow. A more explicit paraphrasing or depiction of the prompt would benefit the essay by giving readers a better understanding of the context and the arguments' direction.

2. **Cohesion and Coherence**: The essay somewhat lacks cohesion, particularly in how ideas are structured and presented. The second paragraph introduces an example but fails to fully elaborate on it, which disrupts the flow of information and makes the argument feel disjointed. Ensuring that each paragraph fully explores and concludes its thoughts before moving on to the next can enhance readability and comprehension. A cohesive thought process, where ideas smoothly transition from one to the next without forcing the reader to revisit previous sections for clarification, is key to maintaining the reader's engagement and understanding.

3. **Spelling and Grammar**: Attention to detail in spelling and grammar is vital for conveying professionalism and respect for the reader. The essay contains several spelling errors and grammatical issues that could distract the reader and detract from the argument's credibility. Examples include ""emotionally"" misspelled as ""emotinally"" and incorrect usage of phrases (e.g., ""frrely"" should be ""freely""). Investing time in proofreading and editing to identify and correct such errors is essential. Reading your essay multiple times before submission can help catch these mistakes, ensuring that your essay is polished and well-presented.

4. **Clarity and Precision**: The point of view is generally clear, with a stance that emotional decision-making can undermine the objectivity and thoroughness of logical analysis. However, the arguments supporting this position could be more descriptive and precise. When providing examples or making assertions, ensuring that each point is thoroughly explained and connected back to the main argument can strengthen the essay's persuasiveness. Aim to explicitly state how each piece of evidence supports your viewpoint to make your position unmistakably clear to the reader.

5. **Balanced Arguments**: While the essay convincingly argues the limitations of emotional decision-making, considering and briefly acknowledging the potential benefits of emotions in decision-making could provide a more balanced view. This acknowledgment does not detract from your argument but rather adds depth, showing a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

In summary, focusing on accurately introducing the topic, improving cohesion and coherence, diligently checking spelling and grammar, enhancing the clarity and descriptiveness of arguments, and providing a balanced perspective will significantly improve the essay. These adjustments will not only make the essay more compelling but also demonstrate a greater level of care and respect for the reader's experience.",3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

In this essay I will argue that the idea of online shopping is a positive development. \n First of all, purchasing merchandises online can make our life more efficient. Take shopping for grocery for example, it is a laborious chores for me to buy grocery in person. It takes time driving between home and supermarket, also a waste of time to walk around supermarket try to find the items on my shopping list. But the situation would have been so different for searching items by type in keywords and click quantity I need then the items I bought online will be on my doorstep the next day. Shopping online saves me a lot of time and allow me to spend my time on more meaningful thing. \n In addition, on the aspect of a supermarket owner, online shopping will reduce the rent. Renting a place for supermarket is usually much more expensive due to the location has to be on the spot that as convenient for people to go to as possible, this fact makes the rent is general higher than rent a storehouse. For the owners of online shopping stores, then can rent a storehouse and it is not necessary to located in the urban center. Thus the shop owners can costdown and reflect on the price. Then the consumer are more likely to chose them in order to have a good bargain. \n In conclusion, shopping online not only make our lives efficiency but also more likely for consumer to have a good deal for their shopping. Thus, my opinion for this essay is that it is a positive development of online shopping replacing shopping in physical store.","I guess I have to explain to you how to develop these essay opening paraphrases. You are not supposed to include any strong emotions such as ""I will argue"" because there is no reference to the need to do that in the original prompt. All of these essays must be written in a simple discussion format because you will never to asked to debate an issue in these essay prompts. All the references will only be for discussions of varying points of view an opinions. Don't include an ""emotional response"" when one is not required. I believe that the better presentation for your prompt would have been: \n <em>These days, people are engaging more in virtual purchases rather than physical purchasing. Some people say this is a good development. Others say it is a negative development. In my opinion, I believe this is a positive development and I will explain why in this essay.</em> \n There is no need to present an opposite opinion in this essay because the prompt is asking you to discuss only the side that you agree with. Anytime you see the word ""OR"" in the discussion instruction sentence, that means you discuss only one side. \n As for your presentation of the rental topic, you should not have focused on a specific aspect of commerce such as grocery shopping. You should have left it general in reference because the prompt did not specify a specific sector to discuss. However, you could have better presented that line by saying: \n <em>A smart business owner would use a virtual storefront instead because he will not have to rent an expensive physical storefront anymore. He can also just open his shop and, as long as he has a warehouse for his goods, he can sell his products. He does not need to look for a good commercial area to set up his business in anymore. So the investor, in this instance, will end up saving money because people will virtually come to his store and make purchases that still amount to real money once the virtual currency is converted to cash.</em>","The essay addresses the topic of online shopping as a positive development, which is a response to the given prompt. However, the introduction of strong emotions or assertive statements like ""I will argue"" is not necessary. Essays of this nature focus more on discussing various viewpoints rather than debating, so aim for a more neutral tone. For instance, starting with a statement such as ""These days, shopping has evolved from physical stores to virtual platforms. Some view this as a positive trend, while others may see it as negative. Here, the reasons for considering it a beneficial development will be explored."" This approach is more in line with the expectations of the essay task.

Regarding spelling and grammar, there are no significant spelling errors, but some grammatical and stylistic improvements can be made. For example, ""the population of online shopping is increasing"" might be better expressed as ""the popularity of online shopping is increasing."" Additionally, phrases like ""laborious chores"" and ""costdown"" could be clarified as ""laborious chore"" and ""reduce costs,"" respectively, to improve readability.

The point of view is clear throughout the essay; however, expressing it in a less direct manner and avoiding emotional responses can enhance the essay's professionalism. Aim for a balanced perspective even when supporting a specific viewpoint.

The arguments provided, like the efficiency of online shopping and cost savings for business owners, effectively support the viewpoint. Nevertheless, specificity in examples could be broadened beyond grocery shopping, aligning with the advice to avoid focusing on a particular sector unless the prompt specifies one. Discussing the advantages of online shopping in general terms, such as mentioning the broader benefits for various types of online stores and their customers, could make the argument more persuasive and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.

In the segment discussing the advantages for business owners, the essay could benefit from a more detailed explanation emphasizing the financial and operational efficiencies of online shopping platforms.

However, to enhance your essay and ensure it aligns more closely with the expectations of an English proficiency test, consider the following feedback:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay partially addresses the prompt by discussing the importance of regulated information sharing. However, it leans heavily towards a singular viewpoint, emphasizing the risks associated with free dissemination. The task requires a balanced exploration of both perspectives—those in favor of open information sharing and those against it, culminating in your reasoned opinion. Ensuring that you understand and address all parts of the prompt will significantly improve your essay's relevance and effectiveness.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are several areas in need of improvement:
    - **Spelling and Grammar**: Pay attention to plural forms (e.g., ""informations"" should be ""information"" as it is uncountable in English) and subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""gives"" should be ""give""). Additionally, be mindful of word choice and sentence construction to improve clarity.
    - **Stylistic Issues**: Your essay would benefit from a more formal tone and consistent use of third-person narration, avoiding colloquial expressions and maintaining an academic style throughout.

3. **Clarity of Author's Perspective:** Your stance is clear; however, it's presented without adequately considering the alternative perspective. Offering a balanced discussion before concluding with your personal viewpoint would not only strengthen your argument but also align with the expectations of a well-rounded essay.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While your essay states your viewpoint, it lacks detailed arguments and examples to substantiate your position comprehensively. Consider including:
    - **For Both Sides**: Specific examples or scenarios where sharing/not sharing information had significant outcomes.
    - **For Your Opinion**: Clear, detailed reasons supporting your belief, bolstered by examples or data, will make your argument more persuasive.
    
To construct your essay effectively, structure it as follows: 
   - Begin with a paraphrase of the prompt.
   - Discuss the first viewpoint and support it with statements and examples, followed by a transition sentence.
   - Explore the opposing view similarly, providing supporting evidence.
   - Present your personal opinion, underpinned by reasons and examples.
   - Conclude by summarizing the discussed points and restating your opinion.

This structured approach ensures that your essay fully addresses the prompt, presenting a comprehensive and balanced analysis before articulating your informed stance.

While it is more acceptable due to exploring themselves by trying new experiences at school and career, I believe in adults enjoying life as a result of their hard work. \n The happiness of youth striving for education and career is something memorable towards a successful future. Youth struggle especially with colleagues is certainly an unforgettable beautiful moment, however it will be remembered as pleasant moments for everyone. An Indonesian successful lawyer always remembers his youth as the happiest moment. During his master's and doctoral education in Australia was unforgettable moments, especially when he had challenging case projects with his colleagues such as the joyful moments when they had successfully completed it as his first international experience. I believe behind someone's success there must be the happiest moment that can't be seen by others, the struggle of youth is one of them. \n The satisfaction and financial adequacy were valued strong reasons to enjoy life in old age, especially to face greater responsibilities as parents. A successful future was actually the happiest goal after the hard effort they had, failure in youth is a reason for success in the future. For instance, an Indonesian businessman namely Rico Huang got his success after several failures. Rico started his business by selling various foods, but due to limited knowledge in the culinary, finally he lost even up to 15 million in just 4 days.

Based on the complete reading of your essay, it appears that you did not fully explain nor present your personal opinion. Since that completely developed presentation is missing, you will have a reduced score as you failed to completely develop all discussion points as indicated in the original prompt.","The essay has done a commendable job in addressing the topic by presenting views on the happiness experienced during youth and old age. However, to enhance the essay, focusing on structure, clarity, and depth of argumentation will be beneficial.

Firstly, the essay’s response to the topic is generally clear, but it needs to be more focused. The introduction briefly mentions the contrasting views on which period of life is happier but could more explicitly state the essay’s stance. The conclusion also attempts to summarize the points made but introduces new ideas that weren't fully explored. It's essential to ensure that all opinions in the essay are fully supported by subsequent paragraphs.

In terms of spelling and grammar, the essay is mostly accurate. Nonetheless, there are instances where sentence structure could be improved for better readability. For example, complex sentences sometimes make understanding the point challenging. Splitting these into simpler sentences may help maintain clarity. Additionally, paying attention to the correct use of past and present tense will enhance the essay's overall professionalism.

The essay author's point of view is present but could be more strongly articulated. Aligning with the feedback on structure, it is advisable to dedicate a separate paragraph to clearly articulate and support the personal opinion. This approach will help in presenting a well-rounded argument and avoid reducing the effectiveness of your stance. Remember, each paragraph should ideally open with a sentence that introduces the key argument or idea, followed by explanations or examples.

Regarding the arguments supporting the author's position, the essay provides interesting anecdotes to illustrate points. However, the arguments could be more descriptive and detailed. For instance, when discussing the happiness derived from youth struggles, incorporating a broader range of examples or exploring psychological or societal reasons could enrich the argument. Similarly, the discussion on old age happiness benefits from more in-depth analysis beyond financial success stories. Exploring aspects such as emotional maturity, fulfillment from life's achievements, or the joy of seeing younger generations flourish could add depth to your argument.

Lastly, it's essential to format your essay properly by ensuring each paragraph discusses a single main idea and transitions smoothly to the next. This includes avoiding attaching a single-line personal opinion at the end of the essay without proper development. Any personal views should be thoroughly explored within the body of the essay to effectively support your stance.

By addressing these areas, your essay will not only provide a more engaging read but also present a compelling argument that accurately reflects your views. Remember, the key to a successful essay lies in clarity, coherence, and a well-supported argument.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

While I agree that the top priority of companies is to generate profits, I believe that they should also take responsibilities for society. \n On the one hand, for most the company, making money is the precursor in an attempt to survive in a competitive world. Firstly, any companies have to cover its running cost such as employee's salary packages and payments for buildings and utilities. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, it would face the possibility of the verge of collapse. Secondly, when enterprises earn much money they can broaden their businesses, which opens avenues to seek more employment opportunities for people securing a job. To exemplify, some international corporations and firms such as Apple or Microsoft has been employing hundreds of thousands individuals around the world, which catalyzes to reduce unemployment rates and bolster economy growth in many countries. \n On the other hand, there are several reasons why businesses should also accept that they have social responsibilities. The first one is that serious environmental damage is mainly attributed to the rising number of facilities. Therefore, they need to take immediately actions to protect the natural environment. Indeed, they could try new technologies to recycle their wastes instead of disposing them immediately. Another reason is that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, especially needy people and those who are less fortunate such as homeless and disabled citizens. It promotes a sense of humanity and leads to the fact that public image of enterprises would be universally popularized. \n In conclusion, although I believe that companies prioritize to make profits, I favour that they should have social responsibilities.","This essay will immediately fail the task accuracy portion of the scoring guidelines and as such, receive a failing score in the end.

You decided to discuss both sides of the issue in addition to your personal opinion when all that was being asked of you to do was to pick a side to discuss and then support that discussion with evidence coming from either personal experience or public information. There was no need to discuss both sides in this essay since the instruction uses the word ""or"" which means a choice must be made. If you were to discuss both sides and give an opinion, the essay would have instructed you to ""discuss both sides and give your opinion."" Since that is not the instruction, you will be understood to have misunderstood the instructions and effectively discussed the wrong topic in the essay. In such cases, the essay cannot receive a passing score.","Your essay shows an understanding of the broad topic, engaging with the idea that companies have responsibilities both to generate profits and to society. However, the task required you to choose one stance and support it with evidence, rather than discussing both perspectives. This approach may lead to misunderstanding the given instructions, and it's important for future essays to closely adhere to the specific requirements of the assignment to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues:
- Pay attention to subject-verb agreement (""companies have"" instead of ""any companies have,"" ""has been employing"" should be ""have been employing"").
- Be mindful of article usage (""the company"" rather than ""most the company"", and consider ""running costs"" instead of ""running cost"").
- Look out for singular and plural consistency (""take immediately actions"" should be ""take immediate action"").

Your point of view is present, indicating that companies should not only focus on profit but also engage in social responsibilities. However, clarifying and emphasizing your stance at the beginning can strengthen the reader's understanding of your essay’s direction.

The arguments you present are generally clear and provide a basis for your viewpoint. To improve, consider the following:
- Be specific in examples and make sure they directly support your stance. For example, when mentioning technologies for recycling, detailing how this directly impacts society or the economy can strengthen your argument.
- Ensure your examples are accurately supporting the argument you are making. For the argument about employment opportunities through companies like Apple or Microsoft, ensure it is clear how this supports your view on societal responsibilities.

Lastly, in your conclusion, reaffirming your stance with a brief summary of your key points will make your argument more compelling.

While I agree that people should become vegetarians , I believe that meat is necessary for our meals. \n On the one hand, there are a number of reasons why people ought to become vegetarians. First, a vegetarian diet might be high in healthy nutrients, such as vitamins, fibers and minerals, which could be beneficial for the immune system. For instance, being in a vegetarian diet encourages people to eat more vegetables which are helpful to build up their immunity and avoid diseases. Second, because of not eating meat, many people could easily lose their weight by following a low calories diet. For example, people who are overweight would quickly get slimmer body and flatter their physical appearances by these diets. \n On the other hand, I believe that the diet which there is no meat could bring lots of harmfulness to our health . First, since there might be not enough nutrients for the metabolism of the body, that lack could cause a lot of digestive troubles. In fact, vegetarians who do not eat meat would be easily suffering from the needy of proteins, which harm to the muscle system. Second, due to not eating meat, many people are not likely to provide adequate energy for their daily routines. This means that if people have a diet without meat, they would not study or work effectively. \n In conclusion, while having a vegetarian diet could bring a lot of benefits for our health, I believe that meat would be extremely essential for the diet.","Try to avoid often used, but irrelevant phrases such as ""In this day and age"".

It is the emotional descriptive word prior to the dis/agreement that is looked upon when scoring based upon a clearly presented opinion.

You cannot use a comparative discussion in the singular opinion essay. That is why you are asked a specific question, covering only 2 choices for the response. As far as your conclusion is concerned, there is an incomplete presentation as it only represents your point of view. It lacks your original topic reference and reasoning sentence presentations.","The essay discusses the debate surrounding a vegetarian diet versus a diet that includes meat, presenting arguments for both sides before concluding that meat is necessary. Here's how the essay can be improved:

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The introduction starts with a phrase ""In this day and age"" which could be seen as a memorized phrase often used by English language learners. Instead, start with a clear statement about the topic. For example: ""The health benefits of vegetarian diets as compared to diets including meat are widely debated."" This directly addresses the topic without implying a broad argument.

2. **Clarity of Opinion**: The essay attempts to present a balanced view by discussing the benefits of both vegetarian and meat-inclusive diets, but an essay should express a clear point of view. When the essay claims agreement with both sides, it dilutes the argument. Choose a definitive stance and construct the essay around it. It's essential to clearly support one perspective over the other to meet the essay's requirements.

3. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammatical errors and some sentences could be more concise for clarity. For instance, the sentence ""For instance, being in a vegetarian diet encourages people to eat more vegetables which are helpful to build up their immunity and avoid diseases."" could be simplified to ""For instance, a vegetarian diet, rich in vegetables, can enhance immunity and prevent diseases.""

4. **Argument Development**: While the essay provides reasons and examples for both diets, the arguments could be more descriptive and backed by concrete examples or data. For example, stating specific studies or statistics about the health benefits or drawbacks of vegetarian and meat-based diets would strengthen the arguments.

5. **Conclusion Improvement**: The conclusion should not only restate the personal stance but also succinctly summarize the arguments made throughout the essay. Additionally, relate the conclusion back to the original topic more directly to reinforce the relevance of the arguments presented. A more forceful conclusion would reiterate the chosen stance and summarize why it is preferred over the alternative, based on the arguments provided.

6. **Avoid Comparative Discussion**: The essay tries to weigh both diets equally. However, for this type of essay, focusing on advocating for one side based on the requirements would be more appropriate. Highlight why one diet is preferable, supporting this view with logical reasoning and evidence.

7. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Always proofread to catch any spelling mistakes or punctuation errors. These small errors can distract from the argument and make the essay appear less polished.

By focusing on these areas of improvement, the essay can become more cohesive, persuasive, and aligned with the prompt.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, issues related to environment have grabbed many people's attentions. While some people believe there will be more efficient if countries integrate into solving this problem, others think that each country is more likely to find its own causes and apply appropriate measures. To my way of thinking, I realize that it will be better to solve environmental problems on both global and national scale. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that it will be necessary for all of countries to explore their own methods reducing negative effects on our surroundings for various reasons. Firstly, each country currently has been facing its own environmental issues which may be different from others. Therefore, it is probably more convenient if countries, in a way, search for their own causes thus implementing some policies to alleviate certain problems. To some extent, dealing with detrimental impacts on environment independently, more or less, helps governmental offices manage and control more easily. Hence, the government can also contribute to spread a plenty of campaigns about environmental protection. \n On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that solving problems about environment on global scale possibly brings more merits for countries. In our fast-changing world, there are many developed nations launching programs to stimulate interest in keeping the environment from harm as leaders. As a consequence of those campaigns, others probably follow and learn more about numerous methods to apply for their own countries. Furthermore, co-operation among many countries around the world may trigger to internationally environmental workshops. Those seminars focusing on young generations have been giving them more chance to enhance their abilities and be aware of global concerns thus gradually creating a strong network of handling environmental problems. \n In conclusion, based on what I have analyzed, I believe that countries all over the world should have a hand in preventing as well as protecting the environment.","this is a 5 paragraph essay based on the 2 points of view plus personal opinion discussion requirement.

Point of view 1 - make this the side you don't support, but base the presentation on the required public opinion \n 2. Point of view 2 - This should be the side you support, but the discussion should still be referred to from the public point of view. \n 3. Personal opinion - tie in your reason with a supporting statement for the previous paragraph \n Why should the two points of view have a reference to the public statement in its ownership of the discussion? That is because the essay clearly indicates ""Some people think..."" which refers to the public opinion or general impression regarding a given topic. As such you should use more specific terms like ""The parties that say the environmental problems..."" and ""While the other public sectors say..."" so that you can lead into "" that is why my opinion is that..."" Making for a clear, concise, and coherent discussion per paragraph presentation. \n The personal opinion is never included in the concluding statement. That is because it is a specific prompt discussion requirement. As such, it is to be given its own 3-5 sentence paragraph presentation just before the concluding summary. Your concluding summary should only restate the original discussion topic, summarize the reasons for the 2 points of view, offer your personal opinion in a new manner, then close the discussion. The format for the concluding summary is similar to: \n 1. Topic sentence \n 2. Opinion 1 \n 3. Opinion 2 \n 4. Personal opinion \n 5.

I was not confused nor frustrated while reading it. \n As final note, since this is not a direct question essay, you cannot offer your personal opinion at the end of the paraphrase. That is because of the aforementioned full paragraph explanation requirement of the essay. You should have merely stated the discussion instructions instead as part of the discussion outline presentation and thesis statement in the final sentence of the paragraph.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing the importance of both national and global approaches to solving environmental issues. However, there are areas for improvement to better meet the essay prompt's requirements and enhance overall clarity and coherence.

Firstly, the structure of the essay could be more aligned with the expectation of a 5-paragraph format, focusing on two different viewpoints and a personal opinion. It's important to clearly distinguish between the two public opinions and your own perspective. Each opinion should be presented in separate paragraphs, beginning with the viewpoint you are less in favor of. Use specific references to “some people think…” or “others believe…” to clearly identify these as public opinions, not your own, before introducing your personal stance.

Secondly, your essay would benefit from a clearer separation between the summary of public opinions and your own thoughts. Your personal opinion deserves its own paragraph, where you can tie it back to the arguments presented earlier, supporting it with strong reasons. Following this, the conclusion should succinctly summarize the discussion without introducing new information. A well-structured conclusion would restate the main topic, briefly recap the presented opinions, reiterate your perspective, and end with a closing sentence. Remember, the purpose of the conclusion is to wrap up the discussion, not to introduce new points.

Regarding grammar and style, your essay is mostly clear, but there are minor issues that could be polished for better readability. Pay attention to repetitive sentence structures and try to vary your language to make your arguments more compelling. Additionally, proofread for minor spelling and grammatical errors that, while not greatly hindering understanding, can distract from the strength of your argument.

Despite these points of feedback, it's evident that you have a good understanding of the topic and can successfully communicate your ideas. Your discussion shows awareness of the complexities surrounding environmental issues and highlights the potential benefits of both localized and global efforts. By focusing on refining the structure of your essay and sharpening your arguments, you have the potential to create a more powerful and persuasive piece.

However, there are several areas where improvements are crucial for aligning your essay more closely with English proficiency test standards.

1. **Understanding and Responding to the Essay Prompt:**
It's important to precisely respond to the essay's prompt. Your expression of being ""totally against"" the idea slightly diverts from the expected response to either agree or disagree with the given statement. Focusing on directly stating whether you agree or disagree can improve clarity and task accuracy, which is a critical aspect of the evaluation.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure:**
There are significant issues with grammar and sentence construction that hinder comprehension. Sentences like ""First, I believe the characters such and being gentle, honesty, living by honour and from the begging the life on the earth..."" could be rephrased for clarity and grammatical accuracy. For instance, ""First, I believe that qualities such as gentleness, honesty, and living honorably have been valued since the beginning of time..."" Practicing simple and complex sentence structures while adhering to grammatical rules will enhance the readability of your essay.

3. **Vocabulary and Lexical Resource:**
The essay sometimes uses terms or phrases ambiguously, which could confuse readers. Focusing on precise word choice and understanding the nuances of vocabulary you employ will contribute to a clearer and more effective communication of your ideas. Expanding your lexical resource through reading and practice will enable you to express complex ideas more succinctly.

4. **Cohesion and Coherence:**
While your essay presents several arguments against the valuation of individuals by materialistic measures, enhancing the organization and flow of your ideas would improve its coherence. Making use of transition words and phrases to connect your thoughts more effectively can guide the reader through your argumentation more smoothly.

5. **Developing Arguments:**
Your essay would benefit from clearer and more detailed arguments supporting your viewpoint. When presenting an idea, try to follow it with specific examples or evidence that reinforces your stance. This not only bolsters your argument but also demonstrates your ability to analyze and synthesize information.

Going forward, take time to plan your essay by outlining your main arguments before you start writing. This can help ensure that your essay remains on topic and that each paragraph contributes effectively to your overall thesis. Additionally, reviewing grammar rules and expanding your vocabulary through reading can significantly improve your writing skills.

A large amount of public budget being allocated for old buildings' refurbishments has raised much opposition since it is believed to be more worthy to spend such funding on building more houses and roads. From my perspective, I believe that the government funding should not be utterly focused on any development, but should be evenly divided for both such purposes. \n To commence with, constructing modern buildings and roads is claimed to be a superior mission for a range of factors. The first underlying reason behind this proposal is the proliferating demands of accommodations in metropolises nowadays. Owing to the urbanization occurring significantly in cities, dramatic escalations have been recorded in the numbers of urban populations and as a result, more houses are needed in order to accommodate citizens. Besides, establishing new streets may deliver social advantages, as well as the improvement in road safety. As new roads are introduced in municipalities, city-dwellers are presented with a plethora of options to travel during rush hours, which results in a significant reduction in the rate of traffic jams. Moreover, the figures of road accidents can be mitigated once overcrowding in particular roads is eradicated. \n On the other hand, renovating antique buildings in cities should also be placed emphasis on for several reasons. Firstly, such old institutions can become promising sources of income for cities. According to a survey, foreign travelers are inclined to visit and take pictures of local ancient and historical places; therefore, old buildings can be seen as cities' potential tourist sites. As a result, huge revenues can be made regularly by commercializing such constructions. Secondly, historical institutions can heavily stimulate artists' inner creativity with their antique beauty and underlying stories. For instance, a rich variety of pieces of fine arts were inspired by the image and structure, as well as the history of the famous One Pillar Pagoda in Hanoi and undoubtedly, they are highly appreciated and acclaimed by both the public and the critics. \n In conclusion, weighing both sides of the argument, I wholeheartedly believe that constructing new houses and roads as well as restoring old institutions are equally crucial in the development of cities and therefore, even amounts of money should be spent on both purposes.","The essay is well- written and addresses the prompt considerations quite well. The writer has a good grasp of the English language and has minimal grammar errors. The reasoning is sound based on believable reasons. It is obvious that he put great thought into the analysis of valid discussion points. The essay is well-developed. In as much as the writer did an admirable job in writing this essay, these are not all plus points that will result in an ideal score. The essay has a major flaw in the presentation, the word count. \n The main consideration for scoring well in this essay is the writing time. The essay needs to be concise and precise in writing style within 300 words or 40 minutes, whichever comes first. Ideally, the writer should be able to analyze the prompt, outline the discussion, and draft the essay within 30 minutes. The final 10 minutes should be spent proofreading and editing the essay. It is this writing procedure that helps meet the all important C + C requirements. 3-5 sentences, direct to the point, will produce the needed results. \n Do not overdiscuss as done in this presentation. Over-analysis does not help in a task 2 essay because the presentation tends to focus on unnecessary fillers and LR presentations as well. Balance the presentation across all requirements. The format I am suggesting can help achieve that.","Your essay effectively addresses the topic, showcasing a clear understanding of the issues surrounding city infrastructure development. Your ability to present balanced views on allocating funds for new construction and the refurbishment of old buildings demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the subject. The arguments provided are compelling and well-supported, highlighting both the need for accommodating growing urban populations and preserving historical buildings for cultural and economic benefits.

However, there are areas for improvement that would make your essay even stronger. While your command of the English language is commendable, aiming for conciseness and clarity would enhance your writing. Essays for proficiency tests often have word count and time limits, so it's crucial to express your ideas as clearly and directly as possible. Try to refine your writing by sticking to a limit of 3-5 sentences per paragraph, directly addressing the point. This practice will help ensure that your essay is focused and to the point, eliminating unnecessary details.

Another aspect to consider is the structure and presentation of your essay. Ensure that your essay is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a single point, and a concise conclusion that summarizes your position. This structure will help you meet the ""C + C requirements"" (clarity and conciseness) and make your essay more effective.

Lastly, while your essay has minimal grammatical errors, it's always beneficial to allocate time for proofreading. Spending the last few minutes reviewing your work can help you catch and correct any mistakes, ensuring your essay is polished and error-free.

In summary, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and careful organization will strengthen your essay. Your ability to analyze and discuss the topic is evident; refining your presentation will make your arguments even more powerful.",4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","The debate relating to transportation has been in the spotlight for an extended period of time. Recently, there is a belief that automated vehicles like cars, buses and trucks will be dominated in the future. From a personal perspective, such trend, though detrimental to a certain extent, could be considered as a major step forward. \n On the one hand, driverless system of transportation has proven itself to be adverse. To begin with, personal driver's security may be deteriorated. In fact, many criminals now are gradually having more sophisticated and cunning plans in stealing the important information of other people. Thus, just by successfully accessing the storage systems, hacker can take the necessary data and control over a whole engine, easily triggering accidents on the road. Moreover, this trend may cause the unemployment of people. To illustrate, thousands of individuals are likely to lose their job as a taxi driver or bus controller since all the vehicles are substituted by automated ones, which may affect negatively their quality of life. \n On the other hand, this trend seems to be advantageous from two aspects, as follows. First, human's safety will be guaranteed. There is no denying that, the majority number of accidents nowadays are attributed to drivers' inferior awareness like using stimulants or crossing the traffic light. Therefore, driverless vehicles are promised to decrease the unwanted cases as they can automatically control the speed themselves and utilize computer based system to avoid collisions. Second, this trend may bring about a civilized traffic system. The fact is that, there will no longer have traffic congestion and need police on the road since no more human could break the rules and the distance between two cars might be rigorously calculated in order to minimize collisions. \n In conclusion, in spite of several demerits mentioned above, this essay still believe that putting more driverless vehicles on the road is revolutionary to the contemporary society.","The first sentence of the prompt restatement is an unnecessary presentation. It does not relate to the original topic and actually prompted a discussion topic change. The next discussion sentence saved the day though and brought the topic back on track. But the opinion response does not meet the response guidelines. Consider the following: \n O Q: DO YOU THINK ADVANTAGES OF DRIVERLESS VEHICLES OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES? \n Response: ... such trend, though detrimental to a certain extent, could be considered as a major step forward. \n There is a discussion alteration in the response. It does not clearly indicate an answer in the required format. Does this mean the total response is incorrect? No. The second reasoning paragraph was related to the prompt. \n The writer offered 2 reasons in that statement that deals with the advantages of driverless cars. Had this discussion been spread out over 2 paragraphs, the essay may have had a better scoring potential. In the current format, the essay is at the low end of the scoring scale.","This essay provides an engaging look at the debate over automated vehicles, exploring both the potential benefits and drawbacks. However, there are several areas where improvements could make your arguments clearer and more persuasive.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay begins by broadly addressing the debate on transportation, which isn't directly focused on the essay question. It's crucial to directly respond to the question asked. For instance, if the question is about whether the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages, your thesis statement should clearly reflect your stance on this specific issue. Instead of starting with a general discussion, immediately state your opinion on the pros and cons of automated vehicles to make your position clear from the beginning.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling and grammar issues throughout your essay that can detract from its overall clarity and professionalism. For example, phrases like ""majority number"" should be ""majority of accidents,"" and ""thus, just by successfully accessing"" could be simplified to ""thus, by accessing."" Remember to review your verb tenses for consistency and ensure that your sentences are complete. Breaking complex ideas into shorter sentences can also enhance readability and comprehension.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay presents a balanced view but leans towards supporting driverless vehicles. To strengthen your argument, it's important to more clearly state your overall point of view early in the essay. This will help guide your readers through your arguments and make your conclusion more persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You've provided arguments for both sides of the debate but combining them into one paragraph for positives and one for negatives causes some loss of focus. Consider separating your key points into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences that announce the specific argument being made. This structure will make your essay easier to follow and your arguments more impactful.

Additionally, while you've discussed important issues like safety and unemployment, incorporating evidence, like studies or statistics, could further strengthen your arguments. For example, mentioning research on the safety of driverless cars or data on projected job losses could make your points more compelling.

To improve your essay:
- Directly answer the essay question in your introduction, clearly stating whether you believe the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages.
- Review and correct minor spelling and grammar issues.
- Use distinct paragraphs for each argument, ensuring each has a clear topic sentence.
- Enhance your arguments with specific evidence where possible.

4166,https://essayforum.com/writing/tax-private-car-owners-improve-public-93862/,test,Tax private car owners to improve public transportation - ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE?,"In order to deal with the current dense volume of traffic, the Vietnamese government suggests a policy in which private car owners should be charged a high fee to improve public transportation. This policy would lead to certain benefits such as reducing traffic density and improving air quality but there are also drawbacks such as causing inconveniences due to the unavailability of public transportation. \n On the one hand, the policy would help reduce traffic density and improve air quality. This is because when people are charged a high fee every time they use their cars, they only use them when it is necessary or when they are in emergencies, which would cut down on the number of cars at one time, particularly during rush hours, and ease the traffic density. Additionally, some would choose public transportation for remote purposes instead to avoid paying the tax. This, thus, ends up lower the amount of CO2 emitted into the environment and boosts the overall air quality of the country. \n On the other hand, the policy may cause several certain inconveniences due to the unavailability of public transportation. Many areas in Vietnam do not have access to public transportation. Therefore, some can be placed in a situation where they do not have any choice but to use their private cars. For example, one lives in a small town that doesn't have any bus stop or train stations. He/she has to use his/her private car to go to work and pay a heavy tax for using car. However, he/she doesn't have a chance to use public transportation and save money spent on the tax like others, which is quite unfair for him/her. \n In conclusion, the policy of taxing private car owners to improve public transportation can help alleviate the volume of traffic and air pollution in Vietnam. Nonetheless, this also leads to some inconveniences because of the unavailability of public transportation. To enhance the efficiency of the policy, the government should widen the public transportation system first to make sure everyone can access them.","The writer will do well to remember that a task 2 essay scores the accuracy of the information provided when compared to the original topic presentation. The first discussion version uses a general government reference. Therefore, the writer should not have represented this as a Vietnamese government proposal in the interpretation. This creates a prompt inaccuracy since the topic basis has been altered from the original reference. This is an error that will cause deductions in the TA section in relation to prompt restatement considerations. However, the appropriateness of the comparative response will somewhat offset that deduction. It is a very strong writer's general opinion with thesis statement declaration. \n When writing in the English language, there is no need to use both genders in the presentation. The default gender for English writing is always in the male form. Therefore simply stating ""he"" and its variations thereof will be sufficient enough to get a good GRA score. The current format being used is confusing as it tries to refer to both genders, creating a confusion in the reference presentation. \n The reasons presented are sound but lacking in convincing power due to the lack of proper example in reference to the discussion. An example needs to be clearly referenced as a final result of the suggested discussion. Without it, the solid foundation of the explanation does not really exist. \n As for the concluding summary, it will also receive lower TA points due to the same reasons previously stated. The focus of the discussion is a general government, not Vietnam. It should always be reflected as such. \n While there are a few problems in the presentation, I believe that the other scoring considerations could help this essay achieve a passing TA score but not higher than a low passing mark due to the observed problems with the presentation. This is a good start. The writer shows that he at least has sufficient English comprehension skills and at least an intermediate grasp of the word usage.","Your essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the impacts of charging private car owners a high fee to improve public transportation. The points you raise about reducing traffic density and improving air quality, along with addressing potential inconveniences, are well-considered. However, there are several areas where improvements could be made to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and persuasiveness of your essay.

1. **Topic Response Accuracy**: The essay represents the idea as being specific to the Vietnamese government, which deviates from the original topic's general perspective. When discussing policies or proposals, it's important to accurately reflect the premise provided in the prompt. To improve, ensure your essay aligns closely with the topic as presented.

2. **Gender Reference in English Writing**: In English, it's common to use a singular gender pronoun (""he"") when the gender is unknown or not specified. Your attempt to include both genders (""he/she"") in your essay, while inclusive, might not be necessary and can make your writing appear more complex than required. Simplifying this aspect could make your essay clearer and easier to follow.

3. **Conviction and Examples**: Your arguments, while logical, would benefit greatly from stronger examples and more detailed explanations. Including specific, real-world examples can enhance the persuasiveness of your argument by showing the practical outcomes of the policy you're discussing. Try to incorporate at least one detailed example to reinforce your main points.

4. **Focus on the Prompt's Scope**: It's essential that your conclusion and the entire discussion reflect the general scope of the original prompt, rather than focusing on a specific government, unless the prompt specifies it. This ensures your essay maintains a broad perspective that's in line with the task's requirements.

5. **Language and Style Improvements**: Watch out for minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For instance, paying attention to article use and making sure your sentences flow well can improve the readability of your essay.

6. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay does a good job of presenting a clear point of view. Continuing to clearly state your opinion and back it up with logical reasoning and evidence will strengthen your argumentation.

In summary, you've laid a good foundation with your essay by presenting a clear opinion and supporting it with logical arguments. To enhance your essay, focus on accurately addressing the prompt, simplifying your language, offering stronger and more specific examples, and ensuring your discussion remains within the scope of the general topic.

Discuss the effect of this trend,"The past few years have witnessed a dramatic increase in proportion of subjects. In many countries ,Some people think that students should extend their understanding beyond the boundaries of sports and exercise classes which are replaced with academic subjects .Based on my experiences and observation, as far as I concerned that this thought is not completely justifiable. \n Firstly, sports and exercise classes are the good method to train character and life skills. Needless to say, sports have taught us how important cooperation is. For example, when ones play football, not only are ones talent, but also ones need how to combine with anyone else, because the more competitive ones are, the more lower score ones get. Ones need cooperation to build plans and formation. If someone on the team does not associate with each other, that team will lose. Not only do sports need it, but also one's life, one'swork and community even need it to exist. Moreover, sports and exercise classes built good health and flexibility. Nowadays, when advanced technology which are encouraging a lot of benefits have been invented , so ones are too lazy to do exercise .Consequently , Ones have to suffer from so many diseases such as diaries , cancers , obesity , ... we need to do exercise to prevent those things from our health. \n Although, sports and exercise classes are really beneficial and healthy, we should not spend all our time devoting for them. Ones have to learn academics subjects such as science to solve unresolved problems. For example, if ones want to know where diseases come from or how to find the solutions to whatever drawbacks, ones need to have knowledge from academic subjects ones have learnt. By using those knowledge, ones find out what we ones have to do. \n To conclude, we have to separate our time for muscular class and academic subjects logically. Instead of spending all time studying, and one should spend a little time to exercise and the opposite","the essay needs to have a better presentation on your part. You have 2 possible topics for discussion squished into a single paragraph when the expectation of the reader, would have been for you to separate the topics in order to create a clearer and more cohesive / coherent discussion of the essay. There should have been one paragraph for the lesson about sportsmanship and cooperation and then another for the health issue, specifically obesity. \n By the way, do not use special characters such as ellipses in your writing. This is a formal, academic essay so the sentences need to be free of clutter and filler punctuation marks. You also need to double check your capitalization, you have the word ""Consequently"" in capital, then a comma, then another capital letter. However, the capital letter does not represent a noun therefore, it should have been written totally in lower case letters. \n I would score this essay no higher than a 4 or 5 overall.","The essay addresses the topic by discussing the balance between physical and academic education. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make the essay more effective.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay correctly addresses the debate over the importance of both academic subjects and physical education but lacks a clear structure to effectively separate and develop each argument. Consider dividing the essay into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a different aspect of the discussion. For example, one paragraph could focus on the benefits of sports and exercise for character and life skills, and another could explore the importance of academic subjects in solving problems.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay contains several spelling and grammar errors, and the use of style could be improved. Avoid using non-standard forms like ""ones"" as a subject and be cautious with the use of plural and singular forms. Also, avoid using special characters such as ellipses (...) in formal writing, as they can make the essay appear cluttered.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The point of view is somewhat clear but could be made more explicit by stating your position directly and using more precise language. Make sure each sentence contributes to your argument and avoid ambiguous statements. 

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The arguments presented need to be clearer and more descriptive. For example, when discussing the value of sports and exercise, provide specific examples and explain how these activities teach important life skills. Similarly, when arguing for the importance of academic subjects, detail how these subjects contribute to solving societal problems.

Additional Recommendations:
- Pay attention to punctuation and capitalization. For instance, avoid capitalizing words unnecessarily (e.g., ""Consequently, ones have to suffer...""). Each sentence should start with a capital letter, and proper nouns should be capitalized.
- Aim for a more formal tone suitable for an academic essay. Simplify the language but ensure it remains formal and precise.
- Consider concluding the essay with a stronger statement that summarizes the main points and reaffirms your position on the balance between physical and academic education.

Therefore, valuating precisely the two aspects of this tendency is an essential part of making decision that whether or not individuals should study abroad. \n Experience and qualifications can be anticipated as major reasons because people tend to chase good things. The first reason is that studying in totally new environment allows individuals to have access to modern educational background. Therefore, learners can acquire intensive knowledge. For example, Germany can be deemed as country having the greatest education all over the world. Bringing this advantage to learners turns Germany into one of the greatest destinations for studying. Another reason is that the importance of qualification in the world full of competition. As the matter of fact, getting a valuable qualification, especially in developed countries, will give rise to improve career prospects and the opportunities for a higher salary.

The most transparent effect is that reduce in rate of learned workforce. It is obvious that almost students studying abroad is very intelligent people. As the case in point, champions in Olympia contest certainly win scholarship for studying in Australia and none of them has intention to work in Vietnam after their studies. Brain drain is conducive to reducing in high quality workforce in Vietnam.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay contains minor spelling and grammatical errors. Pay close attention to sentence structure to avoid run-on sentences and ensure clarity. Using simpler language can help make the arguments more accessible. For instance, ""valuating precisely"" could be simplified to ""accurately evaluating."" Furthermore, the essay would benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve readability and engagement.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay presents a view that recognizes both the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad.

For example, directly stating if the author believes the benefits outweigh the negative implications could solidify the argument.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay introduces valid points, such as the acquisition of intensive knowledge and better career prospects due to qualifications from developed countries.

Furthermore, each point should be clearly stated and elaborated upon in its paragraph, adhering to a structured format—ideally, a five-paragraph essay format.

**Additional Observations**:
- **Structure**: In keeping with typical essay formats, especially for assessments like IELTS Task 2, aim for a five-paragraph structure: an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. This structure allows for a clearer presentation of ideas.

Personally, I believe that this is a forward to a negative growth of humans today. This article will tackle the different drawbacks of overspending money for material items. \n One negative effect of this situation is the transformation of people to becoming materialistic. In other words, their character changes towards prioritizing happiness through material things. Furthermore, these people put too much value on money because it gives them the immediate happiness they are longing for. As a result, there is an unending desire of having more than what is already owned. For instance, mobile companies have been upgrading phones every year and a lot of people feel the need of being in the trend of the latest gadgets. \n Another drawback is that humans set aside saving money for their future needs. People put too much of their money on other things and does not prioritize their future by saving money. This could effect when they would need emergency funds if future incidents happens. For example, when someone in their family gets sick they cannot help them because they have no savings on their account. This could mean another problem adding to the current endeavor that they are facing. \n To conclude, the usage of money on products gives more negative effect than the benefit that one could get.

- Your opening statement is a bit confusing. Instead of saying ""a forward to a negative growth of humans today,"" a clearer way to express your idea could be ""a negative development in our modern society."" This makes your stance clearer to the reader right from the beginning.
- Ensure your conclusion directly restates your position without introducing new ideas.

Remember, the concluding paragraph is for summarizing your points, not introducing new comparisons.

2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:
- There are minor grammatical errors throughout your essay. For example, ""effect"" should be ""affect"" in the sentence discussing future emergencies. Paying attention to such details can significantly improve the readability of your essay.
- Avoid overly complex or intellectual sounding phrases if they make your sentences hard to understand. Simple, clear language often communicates your ideas more effectively.

3. Clear Point of View:

One reason is that social media gives wings to the spread of the fame of celebrities.

For cohesive considerations, the same information presentation format as the first should have been followed as I suggested. These would have resulted in a maximized C+C scoring consideration. \n Overall, the essay is not going to fail since it meets all of the passing score requirements. However, it could have gotten a higher than expected score if certain aspects were presented in a particular manner.","This essay presents an interesting perspective on why young people today might prioritize celebrities over historical figures, along with suggestions for how to address this issue. However, to enhance the effectiveness and clarity of the essay, there are several areas that can be improved.

Firstly, the essay successfully introduces the topic at hand but doesn't provide a clear roadmap of the discussion that will follow. A more detailed thesis statement could help guide the reader by explicitly stating the main reasons for this trend and the proposed solutions. This not only clarifies the purpose of the essay but also sets expectations for the reader.

Regarding coherence and cohesion, which refer to how well the essay flows and how ideas connect, there is room for improvement. To strengthen this aspect, begin each supporting paragraph with a clear topic sentence that states the main idea. For instance, when discussing reasons, start with the challenges related to presenting historical figures, followed by the influence of celebrities through social media. This structure helps the reader follow the analysis more naturally, providing a balance between problem and analysis before moving to solutions.

In terms of solutions, using a similar structured approach benefits the essay's coherence. Start with how historical movies can engage young people, then move on to interactive learning methods like museum visits. This order shows a logical progression from identifying issues to proposing well-thought-out solutions, enhancing the overall argumentative effectiveness of the essay.

On the language front, the essay is generally well-written, but there are occasional spelling and grammatical errors that could be refined. For instance, ""interested"" was misspelled as ""intersted."" Careful proofreading would ensure these small yet impactful mistakes are corrected, contributing to a polished final product.

The point of view is clear throughout the essay; however, explicit connections between the ideas would strengthen it further. Making sure each paragraph flows smoothly into the next, with connective words and phrases, can help reinforce the author's position and make the argument more persuasive.

Finally, specific examples or more descriptive details about how these strategies (like making historical movies or interactive learning) would work can enrich the essay, making the arguments more vivid and convincing to the reader.

In conclusion, by addressing these areas—clearly outlining the essay's structure, improving cohesion and coherence, correcting language mistakes, and providing more detailed examples—the essay could not only meet but surpass the basic requirements, achieving a higher level of proficiency and engagement with the reader.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4171,https://essayforum.com/writing/summary-news-articles-obesity-93633/,test,Writing a summary on 2 news articles about obesity. The summary should be 100-300 words.,"The article ""Obesity Can Trim 10 years Off Life"" (2009) by Nanci Hellmich warns that obesity shortens life, and its effects rival those of smoking. Obesity causes heart disease and stroke which can reduce lifespan depending on whether an individual is overweight, obese or very obese; it ranges from a year for adults who are overweight to as much as 10 years for those who are very obese. The article presents a study reporting that a third of American adults are obese, and these same individuals are continually gaining weight. Finally, the article alerts that obesity is becoming a serious health concern and advises that we take actions now. \n Existing beliefs suggest that the obesity epidemic is caused by a combination of inactivity and excess calorie intake, but how much is each contributing to the problem? New research in the article ""Too Many Calories Are to Blame For Obesity Surge, Not Lack of Exercise, Claim Scientists"" (2009) by a Daily Mail reporter confidently suggests that excess calorie intake is more likely to be the cause of the rise in obesity than a lack of exercise. The study, conducted by Australian scientists at Deakin University, reveals that Americans may have been in fact increasing their amount of exercise over the past 30 years, yet the problem persists and expands. This implies that increasing physical activity as a solution is ineffective. The article concludes that existing and potential health policies should focus on reducing daily calorie intake.","The first article does not fully summarize the article effectively as it fails to present a clear idea of the basis of the information presented. What was the study that was used to create the basis of this presentation? Why should that source be believed? Why is it authoritative? The writer should not only focus on the content of the article, for both articles, he must represent the sources that make these information believable. \n In the second article, he fails to present the name of the writer, making the full article summary questionable. Both articles do not include the method by which the researches were completed and what pool of participants were involved. So the summary is incomplete and lacking in definitive information. \n Such summary writing can be expected of ESL students and those who were not educated in the UK or USA. This is not the type of summarized academic writing that will acceptable at any of the educational institutions of the aforementioned countries.","Your essay is a thoughtful exploration of the topic regarding the causes and consequences of obesity, referencing two different articles to support your argument. You've done a good job in presenting a clear point of view that obesity is a critical health issue, which is exacerbated more by excess calorie intake than by lack of exercise. This shows you understand the importance of addressing the topic and have engaged with it by presenting relevant information. Here are some points to help you improve your essay further:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay responds to the topic by discussing the impact of obesity and exploring its causes. However, to strengthen your essay, consider including information on why the sources you've cited (the articles) are authoritative. For example, mention the study or research method used in each article to add credibility to the information you're presenting.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: Your essay is generally well-written, but remember to keep an eye out for minor grammar mistakes and ensure consistent use of tenses throughout your essay. Also, try to vary your sentence structures to make your writing more engaging.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Your point of view is clear but could be made stronger by providing more depth to your argument. Consider discussing the implications of the studies you mention, and how they specifically support your view that reducing daily calorie intake should be a priority in health policies.

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Support**: While you've mentioned important findings from two articles, your essay would benefit from a more detailed explanation of these studies. For example, who conducted the research? Who participated in the studies? How were the studies carried out? This information will add depth to your argument and make your essay more persuasive.

Additionally, you might want to introduce the writers of the articles when possible, as it adds credibility and context. For the second article you referenced, try to include the name of the writer or the scientists involved in the study.

Lastly, remember that summarizing and analyzing articles requires careful attention to detail, ensuring that you accurately represent the authors' findings and arguments. Your essay is a solid starting point, but by addressing these points, you can make your argument stronger and more convincing.

Keep working hard and focusing on these improvements, and you will see progress in the clarity and persuasiveness of your essays.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Analytical

While it is thought that living in rural areas is advantageous for people to enhance their healthy lifestyle, I still hold the view that there are plenty of existing merits for humans' health when they reside in big cities. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that the quality of the environment is a crucial aspect that primarily contributes to a healthy life of citizens living in the countryside. The industrialization, which exacerbates polluted problems, does not exist in rural areas, so people residing in those areas can breathe the fresh air, and drink purified water. It is transparent that countrysides' dwellers rarely suffer from health problems such as air hunger and allergies, and it is easier to maintain their healthy lifestyle. \n On the other hand, cities' inhabitants have vast chances to approach modern facilities and equipment in order to improve their mental and physical health. By the means of technological advances, urban areas can provide their citizens with plenty of medical facilities so that these people can check and cure their ailments earlier, which is totally beneficial for health. Furthermore, because of a developed economy, authorities of big cities can spend a wide range of money on building and restoring infrastructures, particularly hospitals and health centres. Besides, exercise instruments are also equipped sufficiently in public parks, so people can work out whenever they want without payment. \n To recapitulate, although there may be a positive scenario for inhabitants' health when they settle in bucolic provinces, I can not ignore the multitude of health benefits that cutting-edge technologies and modern amenities in urban areas bring for dwellers.","<quotation>I still hold the view</quotation> \n It is not only your opinion on the discussion topic that is needed to complete your opinion statement. The need to answer via ""To what extent do you agree or disagree ?"" must be represented before anything else. A combined response would work in this case. A combined response would be presented like: \n Due to a personal preference, I still <b>STRONGLY</b> hold the view that... \n The highlighted word is the "" extent"" response needed by the prompt question. Such a combined thought statement creates a highly responsive presentation and recieves a better accuracy consideration. The reason for the opinion is clear, it is the expected response that was not \n provided creating an incomplete response in the process. \n <quotation>On the one han</quotation> \n <quotation>On the other hand</quotation> \n Please remember that an extent essay is a single opinion defense writing test. it is not the task of the writer to convince the reader that lboth sides have a good reason to be believed. Rather, the paper must convince the reader, using at least 2 valid reasons, that your opinion is the correct one and must be believed. Only the opinion defense paragraph will be considered for scoring.

It's clear the essay aims to argue that urban living provides significant health advantages due to access to modern facilities and equipment. However, there are several areas for improvement to make the argument more persuasive and the essay better structured and written. 

Firstly, it's essential to directly answer the prompt in your thesis statement. Instead of saying ""I still hold the view,"" consider specifying to what extent you agree or disagree with the statement provided. For example, ""Due to personal experience and observed outcomes, I strongly believe that..."" This approach will make your position clearer and more forceful.

Regarding your handling of both sides of the argument, it is important to remember that this type of essay typically focuses on defending your point of view with clear and solid reasons. While contrasting views can be acknowledged, ensure that the essay primarily strengthens your side. Therefore, dedicating the same amount of essay space to both perspectives may not be the most effective strategy. Focusing on developing stronger support for your argument about the benefits of urban living for health would make your essay more potent.

In terms of language and style, make sure to join words correctly for precise meaning—""cannot"" instead of ""can not,"" for example. Attention to such details enhances the readability and professionalism of your essay.

There are also some spelling and grammar issues that need attention. Be vigilant about avoiding spelling mistakes and maintaining grammatical accuracy to ensure your ideas are communicated clearly. Furthermore, simplifying your language can make your argument more accessible and easier to understand, which is crucial in an essay intended for a broad audience.

To improve your essay:
- Clearly state the extent of your agreement or disagreement at the beginning.
- Focus more on supporting your viewpoint with at least two strong reasons rather than equally discussing both perspectives.
- Pay close attention to spelling and grammar, ensuring words are correctly combined and sentences are well-constructed.
- Consider simplifying your language to ensure your arguments are clear and easily understood.

By addressing these points, you can create a more compelling, clear, and polished essay that effectively communicates your stance on the health benefits of urban versus rural living.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative
4173,https://essayforum.com/writing/education-young-people-important-countries-80275/,test,Education for young people is important in many countries. What about illiterate adults?,"Many believed that more money should be invested by authorities to educate adults who are illiterate. While I believe that the young should get education no matter what situations are, I argue that the government should give an equal spending on both adult illiteracy and young people. \n To begin with, financial resources of a nation should be spent on education for young people. Firstly, due to the lack of infrastructure and the shortage of teachers in rural areas, many children in these places are unlikely to receive schooling. Therefore, this leads to the fact that they may become illiterate at the later stage of their age. Secondly, because many poor families cannot pay tuition fees for their children, the government should make it possible to offer them to go to school by allocating money for building public schools or funding scholarships. Consequently, young people will have schooling, helping society to eradicate the illiteracy rate in the long run. \n However, adult people who cannot read and write should also need attention from authorities. The first problem is that it may be inconvenient or even serious for adults in some situations since they do not have basic literacy skills. For example, it will be dangerous for them if they travel on roads without an ability in reading traffic signals. This may lead to fatal consequences not only for them but also for other commuters and pedestrians. The second problem is that as they are not literate, they will find it difficult to know what happens around them when they are unable to read newspapers or books. Therefore, they will become much more dependent on others and gradually lose their confidence in their life. \n In conclusion, although youngsters have to receive education at any cost, authorities should spend equally money on giving young people education and removing the literacy in adults.","for starters, you are not giving the correct response in your thesis statement. Your response is not aligned with the prompt requirements because the: \n Prompt Question is: To what extent do you agree or disagree? \n Your Response: I argue that the government should give an equal spending on both adult illiteracy and young people. \n Your response does not respond to the question being asked. You have shown that your English comprehension abilities do not extend to understanding the basic instructional concepts used in English essay writing. This misconception on your part regarding the discussion requirements led you to create your own discussion prompt, question, and response development. This is better known as a prompt deviation is always spells a disastrous score for the test takers in the end. \n You got only a partially correct response to the prompt in the discussion paragraphs. This is not equivalent to a passing TA score because your prompt response in the paragraph was still incorrect as it did not deliver the correct extent response. Once the TA section does not get a passing score, it will be next to impossible for you get a score of 5 in the final scoring because you have other errors in the presentation that will further pull your overall scores down. Since this is an extent essay, you could have responded by saying that you partially agree with the statement and then offered a comparison discussion of the two sides of the issues. That would have been acceptable enough over the prompt deviation you created in your response. \n This is precisely the reason why you should not write more than 275 words for a Task 2 essay. You need time to review your content and make sure that you understood the instructions and that you provided the correct answer to the question. Once you make a mistake in your response and you do not correct it, you cannot expect to pass the test. You need to deliver an appropriate response with a polished presentation in your essay response as much as possible.","Upon reviewing the essay, it's crucial to ensure that the response directly addresses the prompt's question, which is to discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the given statement. The essay presents a balanced view by advocating for equal funding for adult illiteracy and education for the young. However, it does not explicitly state whether the author agrees or disagrees with increasing investment in adult education. An explicit stance, aligned with the prompt's requirement to address the extent of agreement or disagreement, will strengthen the thesis and meet the essay's requirements more accurately.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is relatively clear and free from major errors. However, attention to sentence structure and verb tense consistency can improve clarity and cohesiveness. For example, consider revising constructions like ""Many believed that more money should be invested"" to active voice for stronger impact and clarity: ""Many believe authorities should invest more money.""

The point of view is generally clear - advocating for equal spending on education for both adults and the young. However, this viewpoint could be expressed more decisively in direct response to the prompt, ensuring the essay directly answers the question asked.

While the essay provides arguments for both adults' and young people's education needs, these arguments would benefit from more specific examples and clearer connections to the essay's main thesis. Highlighting concrete benefits of educating both groups and drawing a direct comparison can make the argument more persuasive and relevant to the initial prompt.

Lastly, a focused revision aimed at meeting the essay's prompt directly, refining the clarity of argumentation, and ensuring grammatical precision can greatly enhance the overall effectiveness and coherence of the essay.

However, I would outline several practical solutions which could be applied. \n The most important reason why I believe the increase of petrol price would be the best solution for traffic and pollution problems is that it decreases the demand of fuel usage. Due to petrol price increased, many people consider if they should use public transport instead of self-driving, for saving the travel cost. For instance, car owners and motorists could turn to travel by bus or car sharing service such as Uber, so fewer private vehicles would make the traffic less heavy and reduce air pollution. Besides, the manufacturing factories would spend less gasoline causing carbon dioxide emission that may contribute to air pollution. Increasing the petrol price could reduce oil consumption of those mills and may result in less polluted atmostphere. \n Meanwhile, some other possible solutions can address this issue. Firstly, governments should concentrate on the implication of a policy to encourage the use of alternative and renewable fuel sources such as wind, solar energy and water power. This means that petrol would be no longer used and the air pollution from this factor would be cut down. Secondly, a modern and convenient system of public transportation could appeal to the majority of people to commute instead of using their own vehicles. Last but not least, authorities are making efforts to build car-free cities shown good results in coping with mounting matters of traffic and pollution. \n In conclusion, a broad spectrum of solutions is accessible to tackle escalating traffic and environmental pollution problems, also proposing a more expensive price of petrol can be a contributing factors to support. \n (Total: 270 words)","Please try to write a minimum of three sentences for your opening paraphrase and summary conclusion paragraphs. The 3 sentence ruling is used because a complete paragraph, as per IELTS instructions, must be composed of at least 3 sentences before it can appear to meet the C&C standards of the test. While your discussion paragraphs are within the maximum 5 sentence requirement, you do not really fully develop the discussion ideas and instead, only offer a listing of possible solutions and reasons why alternative solutions might work. To get a better C&C score, which leads to a better LR and GRA score, you need to fully develop the discussion by offering explanations and examples. \n That is why it would be best for you to discuss no more than 2 related topics per paragraph so you can use a transition sentence mid-paragraph which would help to increase the clarity and strength of your explanations. By the way, the essay is written in real time, that means the timeline is in the present, not in the past. Yet there were sections where you used past tense in the essay. Be conscious of the time frame you are writing about, it could affect your GRA scores. \n This is not a bad attempt at Task 2 writing. However, the problems with your presentation style are very obvious. Hopefully we can help you address those issues and polish your writing style to help you pass the test.","Your essay begins with a clear stance that rising petrol prices can significantly tackle traffic congestion and pollution issues. This clear position sets a good foundation for the discussion. However, the essay would benefit from expanding your introduction to at least three sentences. This expansion could include a brief mention of the solutions that will be discussed, thereby immediately setting the stage for the reader.

One major area for improvement lies in the development of your ideas. Although the essay lists several potential solutions, these suggestions are not extensively explained or supported with examples. Enhancing your discussions by not only listing these solutions but also delving into how and why they might be effective would significantly strengthen your argument. It's advisable to limit the discussion to two related ideas per paragraph, which allows for a more thorough exploration of each point. Additionally, incorporating transition sentences within these paragraphs can greatly improve the flow and coherence of your writing. 

Regarding your writing style, remember to maintain consistency in your verb tense. Since your essay discusses current solutions and perspectives, it's important to use the present tense throughout your discussion. There were instances of past tense usage, which could potentially confuse readers and detract from the clarity and professionalism of your work.

Your conclusion, much like your introduction, should consist of at least three sentences. It's beneficial to summarize the key points discussed and reiterate the significance of finding effective solutions to traffic and pollution problems. Emphasizing the practicality and potential impacts of these solutions in your conclusion would provide a strong closing to your essay.

Remember, the key to an engaging and impactful essay lies in robustly developing your ideas, using clear and consistent language, and structuring your essay to guide the reader smoothly from introduction to conclusion.

(Task 2),"It is said that taking risks brings us many benefits in both professional life and personal life will. However, it also has plenty of limitations. \n First of all, it will cause huge losses if we make a failure, whereas, in personal life, the loss would not be much harmful. More specifically, just for a little error, people have to take responsibility not only for themselves but also for others such as colleagues, friends, family, and so on. And the consequence we have to bare is the loss of money, fame, the waste of time, and energy. Besides, from an economic point, failures from failing to overcome risks also harm society. While in personal life, failure due to risky decisions or situations, which gives an adverse effect on us, is even less hazardous. \n On the other hand, we could receive some benefits thanks to taking risks. The very first example of this is that we can learn how to prepare for every situation. Under all circumstances, people will try to make every effort by thinking and even try to find more effective ways to deal with each failure. Secondly, accepting unsuccessful things in life helps us to be more responsible to ourselves, and to society, as well as to support the improvement of personal skills for later achievements. Fail does not mean the end, and if we overcome, we may get everyones' recognition and admiration. \n In brief, there are both advantages and disadvantages to taking the risk. Everyone will have their own opinion but in my view, even though the benefits outweighed the drawbacks the sweet fruits that we can obtain after adventurous trips are worth the risk we try.","The prompt restatement is fully inapplicable to the original topic. It does not refer to the original discussion in any way. It actually presents a different topic focus because the original talks of the importance of taking risks, while the interpretation discusses benefits that risks bring to a person. It is discussing limitations when that is not the reference point of the discussion instruction. Therefore, the essay has not appropriately interpreted the first version of the presentation. It will not receive a passing accuracy score. \n As for the discussion paragraph, the writer presents a confusing discussion that is difficult to follow. It should have 2 paragraphs that represent the 2 discussion topics previously indicated. There should be a complete discussion covering one paragraph for the personal consideration and a second one considering the professional aspect. The writer does not clearly represent these considerations in his idea development. \n In the end, he indicates that there are both advantages and disadvantages, which runs counter to the single opinion discussion format for this type of question. It must not indicate that both sides are correct. It will be score based upon how well the writer explains the benefits or lack of benefits of one point of view. There are no passing merits for this essay presentation.","The essay presented makes a commendable attempt to discuss the topic of taking risks. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, relevance, and adherence to the prompt's requirements. Let's explore these areas:

1. **Response to Topic**: It appears there is a misunderstanding of the original prompt. The essay should focus on the importance of taking risks rather than simply listing benefits and limitations. A clear stance on the importance of taking risks in one's personal and professional life, in alignment with the prompt's request, would be more appropriate. Ensuring that the essay directly responds to what the prompt is asking is crucial for a coherent argument.

2. **Structure and Clarity**: The essay's structure could be improved by dividing the discussion into two clear paragraphs, one focusing on personal aspects and the other on professional aspects of taking risks. This will help in delivering a more organized and easily understandable argument. Each paragraph should thoroughly explore one aspect, providing specific examples and explanations to support the discussion. 

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""bare"" which should be ""bear"", and the use of ""will"" in the opening sentence which disrupts the flow. Additionally, try to avoid run-on sentences and enhance sentence variety for better readability. Proofreading and revising for these issues will significantly improve the essay's quality.

4. **Point of View Clarity**: Although the essay attempts to present a personal view in the conclusion, the instruction requires a singular discussion focus instead of presenting both advantages and disadvantages. Choose one stance on the importance of taking risks and develop your argument around it. Offering both sides without a clear preference can confuse readers and detract from the essay's persuasiveness.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: While there are attempts to provide arguments for both sides, the essay would benefit from more detailed and descriptive examples that clearly support the chosen stance. Explaining how taking risks leads to specific benefits (or detriments, depending on the chosen stance) with real-life examples or hypothetical situations would make the argument more convincing.

To enhance your essay, focus on directly addressing the prompt with a clear stance, organizing your thoughts coherently, correcting grammatical and spelling errors, and providing detailed supporting arguments. By doing so, you will significantly improve the effectiveness and relevance of your essay.",4,4,4,2,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

In my opinion, I disagree with those people as both of them are should be integrated equally in modern society. \n First off, it is noteworthy that working in a well-decorated space is able to cultivate the creativity and problem solving skills of employees. The eye-catching visual shows an effect on both logical and emotional cortexes of brain and boosts its efficiency. This is evidenced by commercial advertisements, which requires the large amount of ideas every minute and that leads to a huge pressure on staffs. According to the survey carried out by Columbia University in 201, seventy percents of teams working in artistic building get along better with collaborators compare to others working in boring one. Therefore, these people absolutely gain more achievements in their businesses and lives. \n On second thoughts, it is compulsory for a useful building to supply the ordinary functions as space, safety, durability, access to facilities and economy. It can easily attained by considering a well-known structure symbolized for a city or an apartment which is associated to our daily lives. To illustrate, Hyatt walkway with unsustainable design collapsed onto the coffee store directly below and caused the deadliest structural diaster in USA history. Furthermore, overpopulation continues to be a serious problem in cities, there are not enough houses for everyone. In this situation, a building to accommodate as many people as possible is much more important than simply please the eye. \n In conclusion, I strongly suppose that the architects should balance between practical features and artistic visual in a modern structure.","Dear student, please post the complete prompt requirement for this writing task so that I can have a better idea as to what the actual prompt requirements are pertaining to your discussion.

This is a valuable discussion that is indeed relevant in today's architectural design discourse. However, there are areas in the essay that could be improved for clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. Here’s some feedback to help enhance your essay:

1. **Clarity in Responding to the Topic:**
   Make sure your essay is directly addressing the specific prompt you are given. Without knowing the exact requirements of your prompt, the essay should clearly state the topic at the beginning and ensure that all arguments made are relevant to that topic. Your stance is clear, but ensure that every point you make ties back to the central argument of balancing practicality and aesthetics in architecture.

2. **Accuracy of Information:**
   All factual information provided must be accurate. For example, there's mention of a study carried out by Columbia University in ""201,"" which is obviously a typo. This could confuse readers and weaken your argument. Always proofread your work to ensure all dates, facts, and figures are correct and presented in full. Small mistakes can significantly impact the credibility of your essay.

3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style:**
   There are a few grammatical issues and awkward phrases that can be refined for better readability. For instance, ""both of them are should be integrated equally"" could be simplified to ""both should be equally integrated."" Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and the correct use of articles. Additionally, phrases like ""teams working in artistic building get along better with collaborators compare to others working in boring one"" could be corrected to ""teams working in artistic buildings get along better with collaborators compared to those in more mundane ones.""

4. **Strength and Clarity of Arguments:**
   Your arguments for integrating aesthetics and functionality are compelling, especially with references to how the environment can affect creativity and problem-solving. However, make sure to present your evidence more clearly and develop your arguments further. For instance, provide a more detailed explanation of how artistic environments specifically enhance employee performance and cite your sources clearly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Strengthen your conclusion by summarizing the key points of your discussion and reiterating your stance. Emphasize the balance between practical features and artistic visuals you advocate for, ensuring that your conclusion ties all your arguments together cohesively. It should leave the reader with a clear understanding of your position on the issue.

While there was a problem with your opening paragraph, which I will explain below, the overall essay stuck to the discussion, used common and easily understandable examples, and allowed for a logical discussion to progress within the essay. However, the lack of a properly developed personal opinion held the essay back. That is another discussion that I will focus on in this review. \n With regards to the opening statement, the outline, or manner of paraphrase representation is suggested in the original prompt. In the original, the topic was first given, the first point of view, second point of view, then the instruction for the discussion which included your personal opinion. So the paragraph should have looked more like this: \n <em>There are some people who manage to stay in one job or career all their life. Then there are others who seem to keep switching career and jobs for some reason. This essay will discuss the reasons why people would stay at one job while others seem to prefer to work at various jobs in their career. Additionally, I will offer my personal opinion regarding this topic for the information of the readers.</em> \n The way that you wrote the paraphrasing is a bit confusing for the reader. Clarity in your writing will always result in a better TA and GRA score for you. Keep the discussion simple and do not try to create complex discussions if you are not able to do so yet. \n In terms of your discussion, it isn't using complex sentences in a good way yet. However, the discussion body that you present is understandable enough and does not cause undue stress on the reader. Therefore, you did a good enough job in terms of your LR and GRA. The cohesiveness and coherence still needs a little work. That will improve as your paragraph presentation and use of sentences improve. \n The personal paragraph you presented is not accurately developed because you presented it as a closing statement. A personal statement is never provided at the close of an essay because it carries new information for the reader. The concluding statement is only a summary of the discussion that you presented so that is what should be seen in it. Not the personal opinion.","The essay addresses the topic of career choices, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of sticking to one job versus changing careers frequently. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the essay's clarity, coherence, and argumentative strength.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay somewhat responds to the prompt but needs a clearer introduction. An effective opening should lay out the essay's structure more transparently, stating the different viewpoints and indicating the personal stance more distinctly. For example, after introducing the debate, directly state, ""This essay will discuss the reasons individuals might choose one path over the other, and will also reflect my view on the matter.""

2. **Clarity and Structure:** The essay's structure could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical progression of ideas. Aim to start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that signals the main idea or argument you will discuss. When moving from one idea to another, use transitional phrases to help the reader follow the argument.

3. **Personal Opinion Development:** The essay concludes with a personal opinion, which is essential. However, integrating this opinion throughout the essay would strengthen the argument. Instead of saving it for the conclusion, weave your view into the discussion, comparing it with the other perspectives as you go. This approach helps to develop a more coherent and persuasive essay.

4. **Sentence Complexity and Grammar:** While the essay is generally understandable, there's room for improvement in sentence structure and grammar. Practice using a variety of sentence types and check for grammatical accuracy. Simplifying complex ideas into more straightforward sentences can improve clarity without losing the depth of your argument.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** There are minor spelling and stylistic issues present. Watch out for agreement between subjects and verbs, and be careful with word choice to ensure precision and clarity. Additionally, avoid overly complex sentences that can confuse the reader, aiming instead for a balance between simple and complex structures.

6. **Supporting Arguments:** The essay mentions several reasons people might choose to change jobs or stick to one career but could dive deeper into these arguments with more specifics and examples. Providing more detailed explanations and concrete examples can make your arguments more convincing and descriptive.

Remember, clarity and coherence are crucial. Focus on structuring your essay logically, developing your personal stance alongside the discussion, and practicing sentence variety and grammatical accuracy. By addressing these areas, you can enhance the effectiveness of your writing and more compellingly present your viewpoint on the topic.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

I agree that those traits are gifts from nature, but could be strayed without continuous practice. \n Talented people have inherent abilities that enable them to be special in a particular area. Even some , never had any teaching or any special teaching when they were young. They have grown up with innate capabilities and doing outstanding performance in their own field like music or sports. For example, there are a lot of sports teams which had best training sessions, but they are losing consistently.

Without it, I cannot properly determine whether or not you have properly understood the discussion topic and the discussion method that must be referred to in the essay. This is an integral part of determining your TA score which means that without it, the first score of your essay, which will be the basis of the remaining 3 criteria, cannot be assigned. What I can tell you though is this, your opening statement is so incoherent and lacking in cohesiveness that there is absolutely no way it can be considered as a proper representation of the original prompt discussion and its requirements. Since your opening statement is incomprehensible, it is safe to assume that the essay will fail the TA section in an actual setting. You presented a series of phrases and sentences that do not have an appropriate subject for the sentence to the reader. These faults are serious and will definitely bring your score down to a non-passing level. You must always do your best to fully and accurately represent the original prompt discussion in the opening statement. When you fail to do that, then the rest of your essay score will be in danger of failing as well.","The essay does touch upon the debate between innate talent and the importance of practice, which seems to be the central theme as inferred by the arguments presented. However, the effectiveness of the essay in addressing this topic is limited by several issues related to clarity, coherence, grammar, and argumentative depth.

Firstly, it is essential for an essay to have a clear introduction that directly responds to the topic it intends to discuss. The opening statement should smoothly introduce the subject and present the thesis in a clear, comprehensible manner. In this case, the introduction lacks cohesiveness and fails to provide a clear thesis statement, making it challenging for readers to grasp the essay's central argument immediately.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several areas needing attention:
- There are notable grammatical errors, such as ""By born"" which should be corrected to ""By birth"" or ""From birth,"" and ""Even some, never had any teaching"" which could be more coherently phrased as ""Even some who have never received any formal training.""
- The use of phrases like ""For instant"" should be corrected to ""For instance.""
- Consistency in prepositions is needed, for example, ""Despite of being talented"" should be corrected to ""Despite being talented.""
- It's also important to ensure subject-verb agreement and proper sentence structure for clarity and fluency.

The point of view is discernible but could be made clearer with a well-defined thesis statement at the beginning. This would guide the reader through the essay with a better understanding of the author's stance.

In supporting the argument, the essay does provide examples and contrasts between talent and practice. However, these arguments could be strengthened by:
- Providing clearer, more detailed examples to support the assertions.
- Deepening the analysis of why and how practice complements talent, rather than merely stating that it does.
- Addressing counterarguments more thoroughly to provide a balanced view.

To conclude, the essay's premise is a compelling and relevant debate. To improve, focus on crafting a coherent and clear introduction, rectifying grammatical and stylistic errors, and developing well-supported and balanced arguments. This will not only clarify the author's position but also enhance the persuasive power of the essay.

However, the argument could be strengthened by maintaining a consistent focus on supporting the chosen stance rather than presenting both sides of the argument equally. This focus is crucial for demonstrating a clear point of view. 

There are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention:
- The word ""convenient"" is used as a noun in several places but should be an adjective, e.g., ""the convenience it offers.""
- In the phrase ""whereas with the widespread of digital media,"" ""widespread"" should be used as an adjective with a noun, such as ""the widespread use of digital media.""
- The article usage before plural and singular nouns needs to be corrected, for example, ""newspaper"" should be ""newspapers.""
- Some sentences are quite long and complex, making them difficult to follow. Consider breaking them into shorter, more digestible sentences.

The essay's point of view becomes clear towards the conclusion - siding with the importance of physical sources over digital ones, particularly for those without internet access. However, the essay initially seems to give equal weight to both sides of the argument, which could confuse readers about the author's stance until the concluding paragraphs. It's important to assert the chosen position strongly throughout the essay.

While there are arguments provided to support the author's position, the essay would benefit from a stronger, more direct connection between the drawbacks of digital media and the superiority of physical sources. For instance, elaborating on specific scenarios or statistics related to areas without internet access could bolster the argument. Removing or minimizing the counter-argument that praises digital media would also prevent contradiction and maintain a clear focus on supporting the chosen viewpoint.

What measures?,"In recent years, the need for sustenance is increasing worldwide. There are some factors contributing to this problem. In this essay, the elements causing the problem will be shown and some practical measures will be proposed. \n To begin with, the reasons for the growth of food demand are the rising of world population and enhanced living standards. First and foremost, the primary factor that contributes to this phenomenon is the increasing world population. This means that there is a higher number of people consuming food to sustain their live and health. Moreover, the improvement of living standards is also a factor. Indeed, people nowadays want to try new kinds of food such as organic food, or meat from exotic animals. Hence, this led to the expansion of consuming food demand. \n Moving to the solutions which are suitable for this situation. Firstly, the government should apply some population control regulations. For example, in Chinese, the government has a policy that allows each family have maximum of two children. This can ease the overpopulation problem and reduce the burden on food allocation. In addition, the authorities should support the expenditure for income and technology for agriculture sectors to respond the food consumption. For instance, with modern equipment, food factories can improve productivity as well as the quality of food. \n In conclusion, currently, there is an increasing of food consumption phenomenon and the reasons contributing to this phenomenon is the rising population as well as the improvement of living standards.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to strengthen the essay and ensure it fully meets the requirements.

1. **Topic Response and Structure**: The introduction attempts to set the context for the discussion on food demand increase, but it could be more effective. Consider revisiting the introduction to directly state your main points and thesis in response to the essay question right from the start. This helps in establishing a clear position and ensures that your essay is directly aligned with the topic from the beginning. Specifically, make sure to clearly present your view on why food demand is increasing in your introductory paragraph, as this is crucial for task accuracy.

2. **Development of Arguments**: In discussing the reasons behind the increase in food demand, the essay mentions two main factors: rising world population and enhanced living standards. While these points are valid, the essay would benefit from focusing more deeply on one fully developed reason in this section. This allows for a more thorough exploration and avoids spreading the argument too thin. Further, providing specific examples and elaborating on how exactly these factors contribute to higher food demand can make your argument more convincing and robust.

3. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written but has minor spelling and grammar issues that need attention. For example, ""live"" should be ""life"" in the sentence discussing food consumption for sustaining “live and health.” Additionally, be consistent with the article use, like ""the food consumption"" instead of ""consuming food demand,"" for clarity. Careful proofreading can help in identifying and correcting these mistakes. 

4. **Clarity and Descriptiveness**: The point of view is generally clear, asserting that government intervention and agricultural support are necessary solutions. However, enhancing the descriptiveness of your arguments and solutions can provide more insight into your stance. For instance, when proposing solutions, explain how these measures directly address the increase in food demand. Mentioning specific benefits of modern agricultural tools or detailing how population control impacts food resources can add depth to your argument.

In conclusion, focus on directly addressing the essay prompt from the beginning, deepening the development of your arguments with specific, fully explained reasons and examples, rectifying minor spelling and grammar issues, and enhancing the clarity and descriptiveness of your solutions.

In this essay, merits and demerits of this change will be thoroughly delineated before reaching the conclusion. \n On the one hand, humans possessing a longevity confers manifold profits. First and foremost, it affords elderly more opportunities to get involve in a great variety of hobbies and recreational activities which could not have been done before retirement due to their preoccupation with work. As a result, they can relish a fulfilling old age. Further, the younger generation can accumulate more handy life experience from the old people with seniority. Accordingly, some dreadful vicissitudes in many aspects such as daily life or business can be deterred thanks to that knowledge. \n On the other hand, life extension, albeit offering particular positives, might entail certain ramifications. Firstly, old individuals run the elevated risk of contracting old age diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular. As a consequence, there will be an overdue monetary burden on these people and their family. Besides, a long human lifespan obviously results in an overpopulation, which is a contributory factor to the natural resources depletion. Consequently, environmental problems such as pollution or global warming will be exacerbated. Another issue is that retirement age is likely to be increased thereby an increasing number of cut-throat competitions in the labour market especially for the youth. \n All things considered, the upsides of longevity are eclipsed by its downsides.

He will fail in the TA and C + C sections.","The essay presents a thoughtful discussion on the extended lifespan of modern individuals due to advancements in medical science, exploring both the advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon. However, there are several areas where the essay could be significantly improved to meet the requirements of a proficiency test and to make the argument stronger and clearer.

Firstly, the essay does not clearly state the writer's own opinion on the topic. It's essential at the beginning of the essay to directly answer the question with a thesis statement that reflects your own stance. This gives the reader an immediate understanding of your position and the reasons behind it. For instance, after introducing the topic, directly stating whether you believe the merits outweigh the demerits or vice versa would have made your thesis stronger and your argument more compelling.

Regarding the structure of the argument, the essay currently lists advantages and disadvantages separately without directly comparing them or discussing how one might influence the other. A more effective approach would be to examine each advantage alongside a corresponding disadvantage, highlighting the complexities and trade-offs involved. This method of direct comparison would not only demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic but also fulfill the requirement of presenting a balanced discussion with clear reasons for your opinion.

On the stylistic front, the essay is generally well-written, but it falls into the trap of using overly complex language and convoluted expressions. Simplicity and clarity are key in effective communication, particularly in an English proficiency context. Simplifying your language while maintaining accuracy will make your argument more accessible and easier to follow. Moreover, reviewing your essay for grammar and spelling errors would further enhance its readability and professionalism.

The point of view in the essay feels impersonal and detached due to the lack of a clear stance, and this makes it hard for the reader to grasp your full perspective on the issue. Consider using more direct and personal language to express your views and make your arguments more persuasive.

In conclusion, your essay contains valuable insights into the implications of increased lifespan, but it needs a clearer statement of your position, a more structured comparison of pros and cons, simpler language, and a more direct expression of your personal viewpoint.

1. The essay prompt requires a restatement without repetition of the exact words or phrases. Avoiding repetition shows a diverse vocabulary and a strong grasp of the English language. In your introduction, aim to paraphrase the essay topic more effectively without using the same language as the prompt.

2. Your position on the topic isn't clearly stated. An essay discussing pros and cons should still indicate your viewpoint early on. It's essential to clearly establish your stance in the introduction and conclude with it, providing a full circle to your argument.

3. The essay doesn't always follow instructions correctly, particularly regarding the conclusion. The task asks for a comparative discussion rather than a conclusion that suggests making a decision. Be careful to follow the specific requirements of the essay prompt to avoid penalization.

4. The essay has several grammar, spelling, and stylistic issues that make understanding your points challenging at times. For example:
   - ""These days, there are more human deforestation activities caused serious results"" could be rewritten for clarity as ""Currently, human activities causing deforestation have had serious environmental consequences.""
   - ""advantaged"" should be ""advantages,"" and ensure that your sentences are complete and correctly structured for clarity.
   
   Improving your English proficiency with further practice and study will help in expressing your ideas more clearly. Focus on constructing full sentences that effectively convey your thoughts.

5. The development of your argument could be improved with more detailed examples and clearer explanations. Each advantage or disadvantage discussed would benefit from specific evidence or a more thorough explanation to strengthen your argumentation and help the reader understand your point of view.

Choosing a job (with little to no knowledge or experience) based on rumors of high-return will only turn out to be detrimental for one's career. Secondly, one should also think about the work environment in the organization.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay attempts to balance the importance of monetary compensation with other job satisfaction factors. However, for this type of essay prompt, known as an extent essay, it's crucial to adopt a more definitive stance.

He is the first general of Vietnamese army and the outstanding student of president Ho Chi Minh. As a history teacher at the original time, general Giap was assessed as genial military leader of the 20th century and for all Vietnamese people, ""Anh Van"" is the Vietnamese national hero forever. The appearance of a significant event in 1927 which generated the turning point of his life was the first time general Giap heard the name of president Ho Chi Minh. He read an essay of Nguyen Ai Quoc thrillingly and exclaimed: ""The essay of Nguyen Ai Quoc cause us a wrath as the shockwave"". The event was the first link of General Giap and Ho Chi Minh, created the platform of the Vietnamese revolution. \n In the entire his career, general Giap has mighty victories which the world known as impossibles missions and the best known is Dien Bien Phu strategy. In 1954, French with the financial and human backing of American had built a military conglomerate which had been supposed unbeatable at Dien Bien Phu. General Giap circumspectly assessed the practical situation, propounded the right strategic direction attack. The conglomerate was equipped most modern weapons at that time and assembled more than 16.200 soldiers. However, the defeat of French was inevitable, they faced a united force under the excellent conductor of general Vo Nguyen Giap. In a desperate effort to counteract Vietnamese troops, the French accepted a pathetic failure. That victory of Viet Nam opened the revolutionary path of downtrodden nations. \n Although known as an inbred leader of the century, he had a homely life. Vietnamese people admired him because of his beautiful lifestyle. General Giap has the dearness with children and he wished Vietnamese children could be merry. He taught the next generation must be modest. With all due respect and love, Vietnamese people remembered general Vo Nguyen Giap as a respected father.","this essay indicates information that covers only the reason why this person became famous. It does not give an autobiographical representation of his life from early childhood. It also does not inform the reader as to why you admire the person. You gave general information about why he is admired, but no personal reason for your having chosen him for this essay as a personal inspiration. The personal inspiration aspect should be depicted in the essay via a comparison with your own life, values, and goals. It should reflect how he lived his life in a manner that inspired others to live in the same way. This does not accomplish the task of the essay in a very good manner. Like I said, you only responded to one aspect of the guide prompts so this is not an essay that be entered into the contest. The grammar is a bit confusing to read at times, but the reader can still figure out what you are trying to say. It is just too bad that it really doesn't allow the reader to get to know the general, in terms of why he inspired your choice. By the way, be careful of your capitalization. The term ""general"", when used in accordance with a name is always capitalized.","Your essay provides an interesting overview of General Vo Nguyen Giap's life, focusing on his military achievements and personal virtues. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make your essay more compelling and aligned with the prompt. Here are some specific suggestions for enhancement:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay primarily highlights General Giap's accomplishments and qualities that make him admirable. Yet, it appears to miss a deeper, personal connection explaining why he is your source of inspiration. To strengthen your essay, consider adding your personal reflections on how General Giap's life, values, or actions have inspired you directly. Compare aspects of his life to your own ambitions or values, or share how his story has influenced your goals.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are some grammatical issues and stylistic choices that make the text challenging to read at times. Pay attention to sentence structure and try to vary your sentence lengths to keep the reader engaged. Additionally, be mindful of capitalization, especially with proper nouns and titles like ""General"" when used with a name. Consider using tools or seeking assistance to proofread your essay for these errors.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** While your admiration for General Giap is evident, the essay would benefit from a clearer exposition of your personal viewpoint. Why did you choose General Giap as the subject of your essay? Sharing more about your personal reasons for admiring him will help clarify your point of view to the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your essay does a good job of listing General Giap's military achievements. However, it could be improved by adding more descriptive arguments that illustrate not just what he did, but how and why his actions are inspirational. Adding specific examples of his leadership style, personal sacrifices, or how he overcame challenges could provide stronger support for your admiration.

Incorporating these suggestions will not only address the prompt more fully but also bring depth to your essay, making it more engaging and informative for the reader. Reflecting on how General Giap's legacy resonates with your own life will add a personal touch that is currently missing. Remember, a compelling essay is not just about the achievements of the person you admire but also about the connection you feel with them and how it has shaped you.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Narrative

There are many factors affecting the environment such as natural disasters, .. human activity is one of the factors that have the greatest impact. Some believe that the impact of these activities can be improved, while others find it really difficult to change. Both points of view above, I believe, have convincing justifications with the preference to the latter over the former. \n From a perspective, there are some people who think is very difficult to find ways that can be altered influence from human activities on the environment. That means the change depends on the perceptions of each individual because people are the most important factor and have the ability to decide everything. For example, governments around the world have issued regulations banning indiscriminate littering and require everyone to comply. In fact, the percentage of people who complied is less than the percentage who broke the law that is impossible to improve the environment. In addition, it also depended on the current state of government organization, the economy, education, etc... of each country. You can see when a country has a developed economy, companies can use a modern machine to waste treatment are not suitable for an undeveloped country. \n On the other hand, some people believe that we can together create activities alternative and reduced influence on the environment. Because when we do it together, that helps to change the minds of many others, making them conscious in protecting the environment it's almost like the meaning of the proverb ""Together we can change the world"". Each individual can start protecting the environment from simple activities in daily life.

These activities seem very simple but they are highly effective and pervasive, especially suitable for everyone to easily perform. Furthermore, it meets the needs of undeveloped countries for environmental protection.

You cannot use an ellipse and a comma at the same time. You can only use one punctuation mark as a time. You risk losing percentage points for such an early error in your presentation. Your paraphrase also deviates from the original topic as you refer to the factors that have the greatest impact on plants and animals. By the way, you changed the discussion topic from the negative impact of human activity on plants and animals around the world to environmental pollution and its solution. As such, your total essay will be deemed irrelevant to the original task. It will receive a failing score because you did not understand what the topic was, how it should have been discussed, and you did not present it in the proper discussion format.","Your essay on environmental pollution and its solutions presents an essential topic with arguments that stretch across two perspectives: one that sees change as difficult and another that believes in collective action for improvement. However, to enhance your essay and make it more effective, it would be beneficial to focus on several areas for improvement.

1. **Response to the Topic**: It appears there was a deviation from what might have been the original topic of discussing the impact of human activity on plants and animals to a broader discussion on environmental pollution and solutions. It's crucial that the essay directly addresses the given topic. Staying on topic ensures that your work is relevant and meets the expectations set by the essay prompt.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Pay careful attention to punctuation usage. For instance, using an ellipse (...) and a comma together is not correct. In written English, only one mark of punctuation is appropriate at a time. Such errors, especially if they occur early in the essay, can detract from your overall score. Additionally, strive for sentence variety and coherence in your paragraphs to keep the reader engaged.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your essay does present a clear position, leaning towards the viewpoint that environmental change is challenging but possible with collective effort. To strengthen this, make sure every argument or example you give directly supports your stance. This will make your viewpoint stronger and more persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While you do provide examples supporting both perspectives, clarity and specificity can be improved. For instance, when mentioning the impact of government regulations and individual actions, try to provide clear and tangible evidence or more specific examples. This will make your arguments more convincing.

In your conclusion, you rightfully emphasize the need for effort and perseverance. Including a call to action or a suggestion on how individuals can start making a change can make your closing even stronger.

It undoubtedly exists a great deal of problems having an inextricably interwoven connection with these and proper policies should be given to remedy the issues. \n On the one hand, it is unequivocal that there are enormous subsequent consequences exerted from global warming and the rise in sea levels. To commence with, they will act as a catalyst to numerous natural disasters proactively taking a toll on wild animals. For instance, in early 2020, Australia experienced record-breaking temperatures and engendered calamitous bushfires. These push species at Australian forests into an unprecedented emergency, compromising thousands of wild animals. Plus, global warming also leads to the melt of ice, diminishing the food sources of many species and driving them into extinction. Secondly, the rise in sea levels begets the lost in the world's land. A detrimental consequence of this is that a large number of people will become homeless in the near future while the world population still burgeons sharply. \n In order to alleviate the problems, effective solutions ought to be made to ameliorate the situation. Initially, central officials should take actions to launch legislations and campaigns to raise citizens' awareness about conserving the environment. Since global warming mostly comes from the overload of exhaust fumes, national authorities can apply heavy taxes on factories and the production of some conventional vehicles while tax exemptions can be implemented to other vehicles consuming electricity or alternative sources. By this way, residents are incentivized to use eco-friendly means of transport resulting in effort to improve the circumstances. Besides, the worldwide corporations between nations is of utmost importance to investigate ultimate policy to reduce the world temperatures. The more people cooperate, the more efforts will be made. \n To sum up,as not only wildlife but humans are also affected by global warming and the rise of sea levels, solutions had better be made as soon as possible to tackle the issues.","Your discussion is really wrong and not properly focused. You have not managed to keep a focus on the required discussion points in the original prompt. The original discussion focuses on the following: \n Topic: Global Warming \n Effect 1: biggest threat to humans \n Effect 2: sea levels continue to rise. \n So your proposed problems should be related to the given effect topics. Your discussion paragraphs should be properly divided between cause, effect, and solution. So at least 3 sentences in total. The format could be: \n Topic: Deforestation \n Result: Extreme flooding \n Supporting facts: \n Solution \n Topic: Rising Sea levels \n Effect: Loss of sea animal habitat \n Supporting facts: \n Solution: \n You need to create connected discussion points using the expected discussion elements. These are: Topic sentence, effect, supporting discussion, proposed solution. By discussing the interrelated topics in a single paragraph, you will manage to create a cohesive and coherent paragraph discussion. As of now, your essay doesn't really connect the problems with the solutions. They do not relate properly because your discussion format is incorrect.","The essay addresses the critical issues of global warming and the rise in sea levels, which is commendable. However, to improve clarity and effectiveness, it's important to refine the structure and content based on several key aspects:

1. **Adherence to the Topic**: The essay should stay more focused on the specific effects of Global Warming and the rise in sea levels as requested in the given topic. It is suggested to explicitly mention how these issues constitute the biggest threat to humans and directly affect sea levels.

2. **Organization and Clarity**: It would be beneficial to organize the essay into clear sections that discuss each effect and its solution separately. For each issue (e.g., Global Warming, Rising Sea Levels), the discussion should follow a clear structure:
    - **Introduction of the Topic**: Briefly introduce the issue.
    - **Effect**: Clearly state one major effect of the issue.
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Provide specific examples or facts that support the discussion of this effect.
    - **Proposed Solution**: End with a suggested solution to mitigate the effect.

By consistently using this structure for each discussed issue, the essay will gain coherence and facilitate a better understanding for the reader.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Ensure all spelling and grammar are correct to maintain the essay's professionalism. Reduce complex or overly long sentences to make the essay easier to read for a broad audience. Correctly spell ""consider"" in places where ""concider"" is used.

5. **Clear Point of View**: The essay's viewpoint is generally clear but can be strengthened by directly linking each discussed effect to why it's a significant threat to humans or animal life and how the proposed solutions effectively address these threats.

6. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: The essay contains several descriptive arguments and examples to support its points. Yet, it could benefit from more detailed descriptions and a tighter focus on how these arguments relate directly back to the effects and solutions concerning global warming and sea levels.

7. **Connections Between Problems and Solutions**: It's crucial to ensure that each discussed problem is directly followed by a relevant solution. This direct pairing will help create a logical flow and make it evident how proposed solutions address the specific issues raised.

From my point of view, I believe practical aid and consultancy play a more important role than financial assistance. \n To begin with, donating money to developing countries may be ineffective for the following reasons. Firstly, in case of corruption, the money could end up not being able to reach the people in need. Secondly, there is a high chance that governments or non-governmental organizations receiving financial help make wrong decisions in dispensing the money. This is mainly because some developing nations still lack a number of well-qualified and efficient staffs in fields like finance or infrastructure. \n Comparing to financial assistance, practical helps appear to be more superior when it comes to bettering third world countries. It is obvious that essentials like food or water stand a lower chance of being misappropriated. In addition, people in flooded or far-flung regions would appreciate practical help more as in those places there are few shops to spend money on. Another point deserves considering is that giving advice to developing countries and let them figure out the solutions to their problems on their own helps those countries to flourish in the long run. Since it is impossible for poor countries to receive foreign aid all the time, it is advisable that international organizations help them to be self-sufficient. \n In conclusion, I insist that practical help and advice is more crucial to poor nations than financial assistance.","I do not know what else to tell this writer.

The student is partial to this discussion type for his practices, even though he fails to correct his presentation in any way. Repeated mistakes means the student is incapable of learning from his errors. I am slowly being convinced that this student will not be able to pass the IELTS test because he is incapable of learning how to respond to the essays.","This essay effectively responds to the topic by presenting a clear stance that practical help and advice are more beneficial to developing nations than financial assistance. The argument is consistent throughout the essay, and the point of view is clear and maintained, which is a positive aspect. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make this essay more effective and enhance the chances of achieving a higher score in English proficiency tests.

1. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:
   - Be attentive to singular and plural forms; ""staffs"" should be ""staff.""
   - The phrase ""Comparing to financial assistance, practical helps appear"" should be corrected to ""Compared to financial assistance, practical help appears.""
   - Watch out for the correct use of articles and prepositions. For instance, it's more appropriate to say ""in far-flung regions"" instead of ""in far-flung regions.""
   - Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the flow and readability of your essay. This can make your arguments more compelling.

2. **Clarity and Description in Arguments**:
   - While your arguments support your viewpoint, they could be strengthened by providing more specific examples and evidence. For instance, mention a particular instance where practical help proved more beneficial than financial aid.
   - Highlighting counterarguments could also enrich your essay. Briefly acknowledge why some might favor financial support and then explain why practical help is still superior. This approach shows a deeper understanding of the subject.
   
3. **Repeating Mistakes**:
   - It seems there is a pattern of recurring errors in your essays, particularly concerning grammar and stylistic choices. It is crucial to review feedback carefully and apply it to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Consider focusing on one or two key areas of feedback at a time to gradually improve your writing.
   - Engage with resources or exercises specifically targeted at your areas of weakness. For instance, if plural forms challenge you, look for grammar exercises online to practice this skill.

4. **General Recommendations**:
   - Practice rewriting sentences or paragraphs that contain errors or could be improved. This exercise can help you see alternative ways to express your ideas more clearly and accurately.
   - Engage with more English content, such as reading articles or watching videos on debating and essay writing. This can provide you with new vocabulary and expressions to use in your essays.
   - Seek feedback from multiple sources if possible. Different perspectives can provide new insights into your writing strengths and areas for improvement.

Remember, improvement in writing takes time and consistent effort. Each essay is a step towards refining your skills. Keep a positive attitude towards feedback, and gradually, you will see progress in your ability to communicate effectively in English.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

To make a great holiday, there are three following methods. \n Firstly, taking control of the planning progress by a detailed destination. Many people don't enjoy planning, but you're more likely to look forward to your trip if you're picking and choosing things that appeal to you. It's probably better to visit a place you've never been if you're looking for the best holiday ever. You're more likely to have memorable experiences if you aren't comparing your trip with other trips you've been on. It's best to start planning at least a month. This will give you enough time to research rates, sights, and book tickets. \n Secondly, do not skimp out on a possible great once in a lifetime experience for financial reasons. Money makes the world go round, and running out of it at an inappropriate moment could mess up your trip. Keeping a track of your money may be setting yourself a daily or weekly amount you are happy to spend, could help you avoid issues \n Last but not least, your holiday will be more interesting with companions.

If you want some philosophical conversation on the trip, take that friend working on their doctorate.","Regardless of the type of essay you are writing, the standard paragraph format is 3 sentences minimum. This is the number count that allows you to write a clearer representation of your thoughts. In the first paragraph, you should have summarized the 3 methods for making a great holiday. That way you would have clear discussion topics for the reader to refer to in case he forgets what he is reading about. \n Make sure that your paragraphs are of a similar length to assure the reader of comprehensive and coherent information. Look out for missing punctuation marks such as the period at the end of the second paragraph. Try to explain how the person can create a budget for his trip. Don't just say he has to save money otherwise he will have spending issues.

Accordingly, many worry that it can stimulate practical violence among young adults. I would argue that parental negligence and ignorance in censorship are the main catalysts of youth violence. Perhaps this phenomenon would be limited if parents pay adequate attention to their children in conjunction with carefully censoring from the government. \n The lack of parental responsibility and carefully censoring movie content can cause overexposure to violent media. Most movies today have some form of physical violence like brutal murder, communal riots, and rape to satisfy the need of experiencing the thrills of audiences. Meanwhile, parents subjectively suppose that children are still immature, so they will not pay much attention and imitate those scenes of violence. And even if they are curious, there are parents around to prevent them from extreme acts. Besides, the government always considers that teenagers are always under the supervision of their parents, as follows, it is not essential to limit aggressive scenes that boost movie-grossing. Without any prohibition, these adolescents are likely to be exposed to crime and brutality at a very young age and start believing that it is alright to resort to violence. \n Strict censorship and family education are two measures to reduce this issue. The government must vigorously brush off violent scenes. The young should be educated about the reality of violent behavior, and how it can impact themselves and others. Parents should also encourage their children to form healthier relationships with their peers instead of spending time watching movies. \n In recapitulation, carelessly monitoring by parents and government is the prominent result of violent media. However, with the involvement of both authority and parents, the situation can be reduced.","The first sentence is not a reflection of the original prompt. It is an observation of violent portrayals in the media, which is the writer's personal opinion. It should not be contained in the prompt restatement portion. Next time, place such observations in your personal opinion presentation or thesis sentence. Know where to place a personal opinion so that it can help increase, rather than decrease your score. In this case, it works to decrease the score. \n You do not need to argue with anyone in this statement. There is no opposing opinion for you to contradict. Where no contradicting reason exists, the writer should merely state his opinion, without any exaggerations that will result in score downs due to improper response formatting. This is a discussion since an idea is presented without any opposing views. Do not argue where it is not necessary, required, nor implied. \n The above observations are the main problem points of the presentation. The discussion paragraphs themselves are well developed and presented. The concluding summary is a proper summary that uses the correct paragraph format.","The essay starts with a broad observation about violence in media, rather than directly addressing the topic. This introduction should instead clearly state the topic and present the writer's viewpoint on it. In future essays, ensure that the opening statement directly responds to the given topic. Personal observations or opinions should be clearly identified as your thesis or main argument, not mixed with the topic statement.

It's important to remember that if there is no direct opposition or counterargument presented in the prompt, the essay doesn't need to be structured as an argument against another viewpoint. Instead, simply presenting and supporting your own viewpoint is enough. Avoid creating a sense of arguing against an unstated opposition, as it might make the essay less focused and clear.

On the positive side, the body paragraphs of the essay are well-developed. They provide clear reasons and examples that support the viewpoint presented in the introduction. However, to improve clarity and effectiveness, it might be beneficial to more explicitly signpost how each idea contributes to the overall argument. This can help ensure that the essay remains focused and that each point is clearly related to your main argument.

The conclusion of the essay effectively summarizes the main points and restates the central argument. The use of proper paragraph format in the conclusion is commendable. However, to strengthen the conclusion, consider emphasizing the implications of your argument or suggesting specific actions or solutions related to the issue discussed. 

Moreover, pay attention to minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could distract readers. For example, using ""carelessly monitoring by parents and government"" could be more accurately phrased as ""careless monitoring by parents and the government"". Clarifying and correcting such instances will improve the overall readability and professionalism of the essay.

In summary, ensure that the introduction clearly addresses the topic and presents your viewpoint without unnecessary argumentation against non-presented oppositions. Develop body paragraphs that clearly support your viewpoint with well-signposted arguments and examples. Finally, conclude with a strong summary that emphasizes the significance of your argument and suggests forward-looking insights.

Regarding the structure, the current format can be optimized by adopting the conventional five-paragraph model, which includes an introduction, three body paragraphs each dedicated to a distinct supporting reason or argument, and a conclusion. Each body paragraph should ideally focus on one main idea, supported by examples or further explanation, to strengthen your argument. This structured approach helps in organizing thoughts more logically and makes your essay easier to follow.

Stylistically, the essay contains some grammatical and spelling mistakes that can detract from the overall readability and professionalism. For example, paying attention to subject-verb agreement, proper article usage (""an"" versus ""a""), and consistent tense can greatly improve the flow of the essay. Moreover, using more varied sentence structures and a wider range of vocabulary can enhance the expressiveness and sophistication of your writing.

In terms of content, while the essay does mention examples, they could be more detailed and directly linked to your arguments to be effective. When providing examples, ensure they clearly illustrate the point you're trying to make and consider elaborating on them to demonstrate their relevance fully.

The conclusion, as currently written, reiterates points previously mentioned but could be more impactful by succinctly summarizing the arguments presented and reinforcing your standpoint. The conclusion is your last chance to leave an impression on the reader, so make it count by clearly restating your position and the reasons behind it.

Improving in these areas could make the essay more structured, persuasive, and engaging. Remember, practice and careful review of essay requirements can significantly enhance your writing skills over time.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4191,https://essayforum.com/writing/famous-athletes-entertainers-earn-millions-76556/,test,[TOEFL] Some famous athletes and entertainers earn millions of dollars every year.,"People now a day live in a complicated society, people from different social status and doing different kinds of works. Some people will get high paid jobs because the companies receive good profit, some people get normal salaries because the works are simple. Therefore, various jobs provide various wages, personally speaking, I definitely agree the statement that those famous athletes and singers deserve to get such a high pay. \n Although some people might think that the concert should not charge customers such a high admission fee because they think it is unreasonable to cost so high. Moreover, some people may even maintain how come the products which are signed by those people's name could be rather expensive. However, there are several following reasons to support my opinion why the renowned people deserve to get these privilege. \n First of all, being illustrious singers and athletes are definitely difficult because those are in fierce competition. I could definitely reason that the probability to be a famed people is so low; thus, it is undoubted that they have to work in high pressure, which is much higher than the original people. Moreover, they have to invest a lot of money in marketing and relevant business, so this is why they need to get the feedback to balance wax and wane. \n Moreover, undoubtedly, those well-known people put lots of effort on their works. They spend a lot of time and money to make themselves outstanding under the stage. Each of them is sweating blood to attract the viewers' eyes. Take NBA basketball players, for example, LeBron James is the king in NBA no one can beat him solely, even three people are also difficult to defend his attack. His success comes from not only his talent but also his hard work. He makes a training schedule every day, discussing with his coach about every game and learns from mistakes. Furthermore, he has to follow the nutritionist's advice to control the calories. Virtually, his life is tight and busy, that he can not stop his steps because someone else may catch his steps or transcend him. \n In conclusion, the reasons which I mentioned above explain why I think that the famous singers and athletes deserve such a high wages. They invest a high price to acquire success so it is reasonable for them to earn lots of fortune.","Dear student, in my opinion, you cannot score higher than a 3 with this essay because of inconsistencies in your writing. Your opening statement did not properly paraphrase the topic requirements in the original instructions so it would seem like you are discussing a totally different topic from the original. Then, rather than focusing on the general discussion regarding the salaries of the entertainers and celebrities, you focused on concerts, merchandise, and other similar topics. You also mentioned athletes specifically and how they train in order to earn their money. However,these people are all still in the same business, entertainment. Does that make them better skilled than a construction worker who risks his life to create office buildings? Or is their job more important than the bus driver who takes people to and from their destinations safely? In order to have better discussed this essay, you should have considered the more popular opinion regarding the salaries of these high earners. Since you are presenting your opinion in the essay, then you should first present the opinion that you will be contradicting in order to give credence to your claims.","Your essay focuses on whether famous athletes and singers deserve high salaries, which is a relevant and engaging topic for discussion. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, coherence, and the overall argument.

1. **Response to Topic:** The introduction of your essay slightly diverges from a clear connection to the original prompt. To improve, it's important to ensure that your thesis statement directly addresses whether you believe that the high salaries of entertainers and athletes are justified. Providing a brief overview of the opposing perspective at the beginning could also strengthen your argument by setting the stage for a more balanced discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay. For instance, consider revising ""People now a day live in a complicated society"" to ""People nowadays live in a complex society."" Paying attention to subject-verb agreement, article usage, and sentence structure would greatly enhance the readability of your essay. Simplifying complex sentences and using clearer, more direct language would also be beneficial. 

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view is evident but could be made clearer with more structured arguments. Stating explicitly at the beginning that you believe famous athletes and singers deserve their high salaries due to their efforts, competition, and investment in their careers would articulate your stance more directly.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You provide arguments to support your viewpoint, which is good. However, they could be more compelling with the inclusion of comparative examples. Include a broader perspective by questioning and then defending the value of entertainers and athletes compared to other professions, such as construction workers or bus drivers, as this could highlight why you believe entertainers' contributions are particularly valuable. This approach adds depth to your argument and shows critical thinking.

To further improve your essay:
- Introduce counterarguments more clearly to outline the common criticisms regarding high salaries in the entertainment and sports industry. Touching upon why others might see these salaries as excessive can lend credibility to your rebuttal.
- Incorporate specific examples to substantiate your points. While mentioning LeBron James is a good start, expanding on the sacrifices and unique contributions of entertainers and athletes could strengthen your argument.
- Conclude your essay by summarizing the key points succinctly and reaffirming your stance decisively.

Remember, a well-crafted essay not only presents a clear and strong personal viewpoint but also considers and respectably addresses opposing perspectives. This not only showcases your understanding of the topic but also your ability to engage in thoughtful analysis and discussion.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

It is argued that fortune plays a leading role in the success of anyone. While I accept that luck is an important element, I disagree with this argument and will elaborate in detail. \n On the one hand, I believe that people who do not believe much in hazard can also gain their goals. For example, Mark Zuckerburg is a great illustration. He dropped his study in Harvard University to set up his own company. It means that achievement is not only as a result of being fortunate, it almost comes from his characteristics, such as decisiveness and optimism. In my case, when I took a 15-minute exam and my head was blank. Provided I had always been blessed, I couldn't have done anything in that case. It also means that attainment is largely due to personality, sometimes just a bit of luckiness. \n On the other hand, I suppose that chances do not make a major contribution to the triumph of anyone. For instance, when I was 15, I had to pass the entrance exam to learn in the gifted high school. But I failed and then I took some days to make clear why I couldn't overcome it. After a few days, I realized that I didn't learn by heart a crucial mathematical formula. Therefore, we could not reach our targets as a consequence of our having not tried, not because of our having not being lucky. \n For the reasons mentioned above, I assume that whether or not someone attains their purposes is not because of their destinies.","Dear student, one of the most common mistakes that students make when writing this essay is that they try to justify both sides of the discussion when only one side is required for the presentation. Note that the prompt instruction asks you ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?"" When you are given an ""extent"" option, that means you are being given the opportunity to discuss the essay from the point of view that you can best support. That has to be the point of view that you believe in the most. ""Or"" means you have to pick only one line of reasoning that applies to your personal belief or understanding of the prompt. With that consideration in mind, I would have to say that you did not do a very good job on this essay. Due to the mistaken prompt discussion, you cannot score higher than a 2 using this essay. That is because you misunderstood the prompt requirement in relation to the type of discussion you are to present to the examiner. I apologize for giving you such a low score but when you take the TOEFL test, your English comprehension skills are at the forefront of the exam considerations. When you do not not discuss the essay based upon the instructions given, you will not score well overall. Most specially since your final sentence in the essay talks about a person's ""destiny"", which is totally different from the discussion about ""luck"" that the prompt instructed.","Your essay on the role of luck in personal success presents some interesting points and illustrations, such as the example of Mark Zuckerberg and your own experiences. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to enhance clarity, relevance to the topic, and adherence to the essay prompt's instructions. 

Firstly, the essay prompt asked to what extent you agree or disagree with the statement that luck plays a leading role in someone's success. It seems there was an attempt to discuss both sides of the argument, when the instruction was aiming for a more focused approach on your personal viewpoint. Choosing a clear stance and thoroughly exploring that perspective would make your position more compelling and relevant to the task.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, it's essential to pay attention to the consistency and accuracy of language use. For example, the word ""hazard"" is improperly used when you likely mean ""luck"" or ""chance"". Additionally, phrases like ""luckiness"" could be better expressed as ""luck"". It would benefit the essay to revise such instances for clarity and correctness.

Your point of view appears to be that hard work and personal qualities outshine luck in achieving success. While this stance is apparent, expanding on this perspective with more detailed and varied examples or arguments would strengthen your essay. The anecdotes provided are a good start, but further elaboration and inclusion of additional evidence or reasoning would enhance your argument.

It's also crucial to directly address the essay's prompt without deviating into unrelated concepts, such as destiny, which can confuse the reader about your main argument. Stay focused on discussing luck and its impact (or lack thereof) on success as per the prompt.

In summary, refining your focus according to the prompt's instructions, addressing spelling and grammatical mistakes, and providing clear, detailed arguments would greatly improve the essay. Providing a more direct response to the prompt, choosing precise wording, and deeply exploring your chosen viewpoint will make for a more persuasive and coherent essay.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4193,https://essayforum.com/writing/adapting-climate-crisis-trying-86431/,test,IELTS Writing 2 - adapting to the climate crisis rather than trying to prevent it from happening,"Climate crisis is one of the most serious global issues today. For many people the preferred course of action is to adapt to it rather than to try to prevent it from happening. I completely disagree with this idea as it is will be harder to find a suitable place to live for humans and adaptation is unattainable for other species. \n To begin with, without actions the climate change will gradually worsen and people will not be able to live with it. As the global temperature rises, some places will become too hostile for people and they will be forced to move somewhere else. People's ability to adapt and survive has its limits. For instance, the expansion of deserts has already sped up and many tropical islands are sinking under the ocean level. Global crisis leads to the disappearance of lands suitable for human settlements. \n Even if the humankind survives, animals and plants will not. Our planet's ecosystem is extremely fragile and many species of flora and fauna, in contrast to humans, cannot find a way to adapt to rapid changes in temperatures and will go extinct. Photos of starving polar bears have already shown the dire consecuences of elevated temperatures. In some regions of Arctic, these animals are unable to find food as their prey have migrated to cooler northern regions, leaving the bears behind. \n There is a thought that a suitable way to deal with global warming is to find a way to tolerate it, instead of taking actions to stop it. However, this approach will not only result in disappearance of areas suitable for humans, but also will aloow animal and plant life to go extinct. Therefore, I strongly disagree with accepting this approach.","This is one of your better written essays. You have learned to appropriately restate the prompt and offer your topics for discussion in a manner that will have the examiner interested to read what else you have to say. Your first reasoning paragraph was well developed until the last sentence. What global crisis were you speaking of? Climate change does not necessarily equate into a lack of suitable human or animal settlements. Clarify your explanation. I believe you meant to indicate that ""Urban development will eventually lead to unsuitable human settlements"" , or something like that. I am not really sure what you meant to say in that sentence. \n You do not need to use the connecting word ""the"" in reference to humankind. Are you sure that animals and plants will not survive? Do not make exaggerated statements. Offer a sense of uncertainty if required by the discussion. Your evidence does not prove that the polar bears have been eradicated by global warming. That is not to say that the discussion in that paragraph isn't effective because it was. It was just a wee bit on the exaggerated side which should not happen in an academic presentation. \n Good work on the concluding paraphrase. It was well suited to the purpose. It had a clear topic restatement, your reasons and were properly represented, and helped to close the essay on a strong note. Good job!","This essay effectively addresses the topic of climate crisis and its consequences on both human and non-human life. The introduction sets a clear stance against adapting to climate change without efforts to prevent it, which directly responds to the essay prompt. This clarity is a strength that draws readers in and establishes a focused argument.

However, there are areas that could be improved for clarity and accuracy. When discussing the impacts of climate change on suitable living environments, it's important to be specific about the nature of these changes. For example, mentioning ""global crisis"" without specifying that it's the climate crisis can lead to confusion. Detailing the connection between climate change and the loss of habitable land more explicitly would strengthen your argument.

The essay sometimes makes broad claims, such as the assertion that animals and plants will not survive climate change. While it's important to highlight the severe risks of climate change, presenting these outcomes as certainties can be misleading. Introducing a degree of uncertainty or focusing on the risk without asserting absolute outcomes can make the argument more nuanced and balanced. This approach also prevents the essay from sounding exaggerated, which is crucial for maintaining an academic tone.

Regarding style, the use of ""the"" before ""humankind” is not necessary. ""Humankind"" by itself already refers to humans in general, making the additional article redundant.

Your discussion on the polar bears serves as a good piece of evidence to illustrate the immediate effects of climate change on wildlife. However, be careful with how the evidence is presented so it supports your argument without overstating the case. It's vital to distinguish between illustrating a problem and claiming an absolute outcome, as the latter requires extensive evidence.

The conclusion of your essay is one of its strongest points. It effectively summarizes your position and the arguments you've laid out, reinforcing the central message of your work. This strong closing ensures that your essay leaves a lasting impression.

Incorporating more specific examples and avoiding absolute claims will enhance the persuasiveness of your argument. Clarifying unclear points and ensuring every claim is supported with evidence will also make your essay stronger. Keep focusing on developing your ideas as clearly and accurately as possible, and your writing will continue to improve.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

This essay will examine both sides of the argument and provide an overall opinion. Generally speaking, there are is a wide range of reasons why people believe that big salary is much more important than job satisfaction. Perhaps the main reason why people are favour of this ideas is because money in very crucial and necessary for survival and make people lead a happy life. This is because everybody needs money to pay for cost of living and money also helps quality of people life is better and happier. In addition, when people have a job with a high salary, it makes them feel satisfied and they do not care anymore what kind of job they do. As a result, people can enjoy their life. \n Despite these arguments, there is also a case for the idea that job satisfaction is more vital than the work which is a big salary. Perhaps the main reason why people think that it keeps people motivated and people can promote at work. As a result, people have a chance to lead a career growth and going to set up own company. Moreover, money does not matter as people do the work they love. For example, a lot of famous people around the world say they choose their job because of passion such as Henry Miller, a famous writer. \n In conclusion, this is a topic which is very relevant to modern society.

However, there are several areas that could benefit from improvement to align better with the requirements of English proficiency tests and to strengthen the overall argument.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It’s crucial for essays to adhere closely to the given prompt. In this case, the assignment likely asked for a clear stance – either agreeing or disagreeing with a statement. The essay attempted to explore both sides without committing to a definitive position until the conclusion. For future essays, carefully read the prompt and ensure your response directly addresses what’s being asked. If the task is to agree or disagree, make your position clear from the beginning and consistently support that view throughout.

2. **Organization:** The essay structure could be more effective. Usually, English proficiency tests look for a specific format, such as a five-paragraph essay with an introduction, three supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should ideally not exceed five sentences. To improve, consider restructuring the essay to fit this model more closely, which helps in organizing thoughts clearly and makes the essay easier to follow.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are several errors in grammar and spelling that need attention. For instance, ""there are is"" should be corrected to ""there is,"" and ""favour of this ideas"" to ""favour of these ideas."" Also, using more varied sentence structures can enhance the readability and sophistication of your writing. It’s essential to proofread your work for these mistakes to ensure your ideas are communicated clearly.

4. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The essay eventually expresses a preference for job satisfaction over salary. However, this viewpoint needs to be more apparent and consistent throughout the essay. Whenever you write, especially for persuasive or argumentative essays, your viewpoint should guide the reader from the introduction to the conclusion.

5. **Arguments and Support:** The essay mentions valid points but often lacks detailed examples and reasoning to fully support the assertions. For stronger arguments, include specific examples, data, or anecdotes that clearly illustrate why job satisfaction should be valued over salary. This will make your position more convincing and your essay more compelling.

By focusing on these areas, your future essays can be more closely aligned with the expectations of English proficiency tests and present your arguments more persuasively.

Such as some of them often encounter a plenty of difficulties and sometime become really frustrated. \n As mentioned above, not everyone can has a chance to make their dream come true with ease.

However, to provide more targeted feedback, knowing the specific prompt you are responding to would be essential. Without this context, it's challenging to fully assess the relevance and effectiveness of your arguments. 

Firstly, the structure of the essay indicates an attempt to create a coherent argument, which is a positive aspect. However, there are several key areas for improvement to enhance the clarity and quality of your essay:

1. **Grammar and Spelling:** The essay contains grammatical errors and misuses of phrases (""lucky dog"" is used incorrectly and could be considered offensive in an academic context). Careful proofreading and revision are required to correct these issues. Using simpler, clearer expressions can help avoid miscommunications.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:** At times, the essay's argument is difficult to follow due to a lack of clarity in expressing ideas. Consider structuring your essay more clearly, with each paragraph dedicated to a specific aspect of your argument. This will help readers understand your points more easily.

3. **Support and Examples:** While you do provide examples (like Isaiah Thomas), ensuring these examples directly support your thesis is crucial. Every example should clearly tie back to your main argument about the role of hard work and luck in achieving success. Additionally, try to articulate why these examples are relevant and what they demonstrate about your thesis.

4. **Avoidance of Idioms or Casual Phrases:** Avoid using idiomatic expressions or casual phrases that might not translate well in academic writing or could be misunderstood. Instead, opt for clear and precise language that accurately conveys your intended meaning.

5. **Clear Thesis Statement:** While you mention hard work and luck as factors of success, making your thesis statement—your main argument—more explicit at the start can guide the reader through your essay. Your conclusion revisits your thesis, but ensuring it's clearly stated at the beginning will strengthen your essay's overall impact.

6. **Perspective and Point of View:** Your personal perspective on the importance of hard work over luck comes through. Clarifying this viewpoint at the outset and consistently supporting it throughout the essay will make your argument more persuasive and engaging.

In summary, focusing on clarity, coherence, and careful language use can significantly improve your essay. Ensure each paragraph contributes to your overall argument, and provide clear, well-explained examples to support your points.

As such, your essay has a fluid flow of thought. The only clear problem with your essay is that you sometimes use the wrong word when describing something you want to share. For example, in the following sentence, "" Inundation is the effect of global warming"", while inundation is the aftermath of a flood, the proper term to have used would have been ""Flooding"". I understand that you want to impress the reviewer by using more complex vocabulary. However, you have to study or have the ability to realize when to use certain terms and if the term is applicable to a certain meaning that you want to relay. This is not a bad effort.

However, there are areas that require improvement to make your essay even stronger. Firstly, attention to word choice is crucial. For instance, using ""inundation"" in the context you've chosen may not fully convey the intended meaning— ""flooding"" is more appropriate. This is a common challenge when trying to use complex vocabulary. While it's great to use advanced words, it's more important to ensure they fit the context accurately. So, focus on using words that exactly match the meaning you wish to convey.

There are also several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. Some verbs are mistakenly used in the past tense, such as ""had been"" and ""is inundated,"" where present perfect or simple present tense might be more appropriate, depending on the context. Be mindful of verb tenses, as they greatly affect the clarity and accuracy of your writing. Additionally, consider revising phrases like ""glossaries and ice caps"" to ""glaciers and ice caps,"" as ""glossaries"" refers to a list of terms and definitions, which is not suitable in this context.

The essay would benefit from further elaboration on your arguments. While you mention that constructing flood barriers is a workable solution, adding examples of successful implementations, besides the Netherlands, or discussing potential drawbacks or considerations would provide a more rounded argument for your position.

However, I totally disagree with the opinion that there should be equal entries to every course offered by a university to the two genders. \n On the one hand, I believe that a university accepting the same number of boys and girls to every subject is an ideal place for students to study. This is an effective way of minimizing the gender gaps and showing overwhelming dominance in neither of the genders in the academic fields. Apparently, it is absurd to reject a female student with the highest placement to a course and replace her with a boy with a lower entrance score or less qualifications. By taking part in any courses that they are interested in, students will surely have more chances to pursue their dreams, even in specialist fields that the society has long believed that only men or women could do. \n On the other hand, I also believe that it is impractical for schools to accept the same number of male and female students to some specific courses. For example, it is wildly unreasonable to expect the nursing course, which attract girls more than boys, to have half of its students male, and vice versa in the astronomy and engineering courses. In addition, if an university happened to be forced to lower its entrance score to hire enough students for a course, it reputation might be badly damaged and its teaching programs would be dramatically changed, which directly affect the way our whole teaching system has been working for centuries. \n In conclusion, although the opinion of allowing the same number of boys and girls to take part in every subject seems to be ideal, it is so unrealistic and unlikely to be taken into consideration by universities in the near future. \n I know that my writing is too long (311 words) but I have no ideas which part to cut.","when you are writing an extent essay, it becomes easier to write your response when you only have to defend one side of the given discussion. When you try to write about supporting both sides, you end up not really knowing what to write and even worse, you end up writing more than the number of words suitable for editing within the given time limitations. \n It is precisely because of this reason that I always advise my students to really just choose one side to defend using a ""total"" agreement / disagreement scenario. As a writer, it becomes easier for you to brainstorm and draft your response when you need to focus on only one discussion and its supporting reasons. That way your 3 body paragraph becomes clearer and more cohesive in content. The 3 body paragraph can be set up as : \n 1. Reason 1 public opinion in support of your stance \n 2. Reason 2 personal explanation in support of your opinion \n 3. Example that portrays a strong supporting reason for your agreement / disagreement \n Do not try to provide examples in every paragraph. One solid example as a stand alone paragraph will not only help you meet the word count, but also allow you to better develop your explanations in the first 2 paragraphs.","Your essay offers an interesting perspective on the topic of gender equality in university admissions. You've provided arguments for both sides, which shows an understanding of the issue's complexity. However, focusing on a single viewpoint could strengthen your essay and make your arguments clearer and more compelling.

1. **Response to Topic:**

3. **Author's Point of View:**
Your point of view appears mixed due to presenting arguments for both sides. Deciding on a single stance will clarify your position. For example, if you believe that it's unrealistic to expect equal numbers of males and females in every university course due to interest and practicality, state this as your main argument and focus on supporting it.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
You have provided examples to support both viewpoints. To strengthen your essay, decide on one side of the argument. Use the structure suggested:

   - **First paragraph:** Introduce a public opinion or a common reason supporting your stance.
   - **Second paragraph:** Offer your personal explanation or belief supporting your viewpoint.
   - **Third paragraph:** Present a concrete example illustrating your argument. This structure allows for a more in-depth exploration of each point.

You mentioned concerns about your essay's length. By focusing on a single perspective and following the above structure, you can make your essay more concise. Reducing redundancy and focusing on specific, strong arguments can also help manage the word count effectively.

4198,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-think-books-death-paper-94818/,test,Some people think that e-books are the death of paper books. Write at least 250 words.,"In the 4.0 era, with the advent of cutting-edge technology and social change, people can easily get access to many sources of e-books on the Internet. Some people give the opinion that printed books will disappear one day. While others argue that physical books will never be replaced. This essay will discuss both views. \n On the one hand, it cannot be denied that ebooks have several benefits. Firstly, people can easily download any files of a book on the Internet without going to the bookstore and paying money. For example, even though a man has a trip, he can still read with a smartphone or laptop that connects to the network. By contrast, spending too much time on screen may harm people's eyes because of the blue light. Additionally, depending too much on technology may cause many effects. For instance, reading on these devices can be distracted because of the social media notifications. The information on the Internet may also be unreliable. \n On the other hand, there are some reasons why paper books will never disappear. To begin with, buying physical books means showing respect to the writer. Besides, readers can touch the writer's emotions and get the story's meanings exactly with that sort of book (Thêm ví dụ). Furthermore, hard books are essential for blind people. They read books by physical touch, which e-books do not have. Traditional books can also present for family and friends, which bring them a sense of belonging and keep memories that can build healthy relationships. That special gift can remind the receivers of their beloved people, who send them these lovely things. \n To sum up, while some people think that e-books will be the end of traditional books, I believe it depends on the reader's choice based on their preference. Although there are both positive and negative effects, both will continue to exist in the near future.","The opening summary is choppy and confusing to read. There needs to be a better restatement for the original topic. You have to properly integrate the printed books into the discussion alongside the ebooks presentation. There is no way that the reader will be clear about the actual topic being provided here because of the confusing restatement presentation. The writer's opinion is also not presented at the end of the paragraph. The writing instruction is also wrong. This is a compare and contrast the public opinion with your personal point of view. It is not a public opinion discussion alone. These errors, at the very start of the essay is not a good indicator of your final score. Such mistakes could end up resulting in a failing score for the essay due to the non passability of the preliminary task accuracy score.","This essay attempts to discuss the ongoing debate between the use of e-books and printed books in the context of the modern technological era, providing arguments for both perspectives. However, there are several areas where improvements can make this essay stronger and more effective in presenting its point of view.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your introduction should be clearer in presenting the essay's main topic. The way you mention both e-books and printed books should be more balanced. Instead of simply stating that the essay will discuss both views, try to rephrase the topic in your own words to make your introduction smoother and more engaging. Also, clearly stating your personal stance at the end of the introduction will help guide the reader through your discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written but could benefit from a closer look at sentence structure to avoid choppy or confusing sentences. For example, consider making your sentences flow more naturally into each other to improve readability. Paying attention to punctuation, such as commas and periods, will also enhance the clarity of your writing. Additionally, the phrase ""buying physical books means showing respect to the writer"" could be misinterpreted. Clarification or rephrasing could help maintain the focus on the inherent value of printed books, not the act of purchase as a sign of respect.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your personal opinion appears at the end, suggesting that the future of books depends on personal preference. However, this stance could be highlighted more strongly throughout the essay. Integrating your point of view with the discussion of public opinions will make your position clearer to the reader and align with the essay's requirements of comparing and contrasting public opinion with your personal viewpoint.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The arguments provided do a commendable job of outlining the benefits and drawbacks of both e-books and printed books. To further enhance your essay, specific examples could be more impactful. For instance, when discussing the emotional connection with physical books, including a personal anecdote or a widely recognized example could strengthen your argument. The essay mentions the importance of physical books for blind people, an excellent point, but expanding on how technology offers alternatives, like audiobooks or screen readers, could provide a more balanced view.

To sum up, refining the introduction for clarity, enhancing the flow and punctuation of the essay, directly stating your personal view alongside the discussion, and strengthening arguments with specific examples will significantly improve the essay. These adjustments will make your essay more compelling and clear to your readers.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

I was excited to see how the film will explore the challenges and emotions that come with such relationships.however,The execution turned out to be disappointing. The characters lacked depth and chemistry,making it difficult to invest in their love story. Morover, I feel interested in movies with unique or surprising plots.

Those who have not seen the movie, will be even more confused by this presentation since it does not inform them about the important aspects of the movie presentation.","The essay starts with an engaging personal hobby, which is watching movies, and clearly presents dissatisfaction with a particular film. However, the essay could greatly improve by adhering more closely to the requested structure of a movie review and by refining its language and structure. Here are specific areas to focus on for improvement:

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay attempts to critique a specific film, it misses several crucial aspects typically expected in a movie review. Including the movie's title, character names, a brief outline of the plot, any significant twists, and how (or if) issues were resolved would provide a clearer context for your disappointment. As it stands, readers unfamiliar with the film are left without a clear understanding of which film is being discussed and why it was unsatisfying.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several spelling and grammar mistakes that detract from the essay's overall clarity and impact. For example, ""i"" should always be capitalized when referring to oneself as ""I"", and there’s a typo in ""collaspe"" which should be ""collapse"". Also, ensure consistent spacing after commas and full stops for better readability. Remember to use past tense correctly when referring to events in the movie, and consider varied sentence structure to enhance the flow and interest of your writing.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view as someone disappointed by the film comes across, but it can be made clearer by specifying particular aspects of the movie that led to this sentiment. Expressing your expectations before watching the film and how the film failed to meet these can help articulate your perspective more vividly.

4. **Clear, Descriptive Arguments**: Your critique hints at reasons for disappointment, such as lack of depth in characters and slow pacing, but these points can be expanded. Offer examples or descriptions of how the characters lacked depth or how the plot's pacing detracted from the story's engagement. This specificity helps readers understand your viewpoint and might also offer constructive criticism to those involved in film-making.

Further enhancing your review by addressing these aspects will not only make your essay clearer and more compelling but will also show an understanding of how to structure and present a critical review. Remember, a review is not only about expressing dislike or like for a movie but guiding others on what to expect and offering insight into the film’s content and execution.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,Narrative

I will give you an account of the reasons and I think this phenomenon has negative effects. \n First and foremost, the biggest reason is the development of urbanization and industrialization. Computer games play a crucial role in our lives to help people to ease their stress and let their hair down. However, young adults waste their time to glue their eyes on it without spending time doing exercises. Secondly, because parents are up to their ears with their work, they do not have enough time to remind their child to attend outdoor activities. For example, if parents take a yoga course for their offspring, child will be more motivated to take part in \n It has two main negative developments for young adults if we do not have the solutions. First, one of the major issues related to this is that children will suffer from some diseases like heart attack and eyestrain. For example, they could not do strenuous and backbreaking types of labor when they grew up. In addition, the burning and itchy sensations will be great trouble. Second, another serious problem is that children with a sedentary lifestyle tend to be anti-social because they prefer to stay in their rooms to play games rather than hang out with their friends, leading to an isolated society. \n In conclusion, computer games are played more time by youths than sports for two reasons mentioned above and it seems evident that this development will do harm to them","It would appear that the writer tried to develop his own writing prompt based on a popular task 2 practice topic.

Had this been an actual test, the writer would have failed based on an incomplete discussion presentation. \n There are always 2 reasoning paragraph presentations. The writer cannot provide only one aspect of the discussion as that would make the essay fail in the TA (prompt adherence) and C + C discussion presentation sections.","This essay endeavors to explore the impact of increased video game playing among young teenagers, arguing that it leads to reduced physical activity, with potential negative effects. Here's how it could be improved:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The effort to address a relevant issue is noticeable. However, the essay should strictly adhere to the given prompt, if any, especially in structured tests. It seems the essay attempts to discuss causes and effects but does not fully align with a typical cause-and-effect essay structure. It's crucial to clearly identify the prompt's requirements and structure your essay accordingly to ensure complete coverage of the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
   The essay is generally readable, but there are areas where grammar and style could be refined. For instance, phrases like ""young adults waste their time to glue their eyes on it"" could be more concisely written as ""young adults waste their time glued to screens."" Consider reviewing subject-verb agreement, consistent tense usage, and the clarity of your expressions. Simplifying complex ideas and sentences may also help in making your arguments more accessible.

3. **Point of View Clarity:**
   Your point of view regarding the negative effects of excessive video gaming on physical activity and social behaviors is clear. However, reinforcing this viewpoint with more structured arguments and transitioning smoothly between ideas would strengthen your position. Begin paragraphs with topic sentences that introduce the main idea, then elaborate with examples and explanations to guide the reader through your reasoning.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   The arguments provided touch on significant concerns, yet they could benefit from more depth and detail. For instance, when discussing health issues, incorporating statistics or studies could lend credibility. Similarly, suggesting solutions or preventive measures would make your argument more comprehensive. Remember to always link your examples and evidence directly back to your main argument to maintain focus and coherence.

5. **Other Considerations:**
   - Ensure your essay follows a logical structure: introduction, body paragraphs (each dedicated to a specific point with evidence), and a conclusion that summarizes your main points and restates your position.
   - Reflect on the cause and effect writing format, which typically includes exploring both reasons (causes) and outcomes (effects). This can provide a balanced and thorough discussion.

To enhance your essay further, focusing on creating a clear outline before writing can help in organizing your thoughts and maintaining a logical flow of ideas. Additionally, reading your essay out loud or seeking peer reviews could help identify areas for improvement that may not be initially evident.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Cause-Effect

I know, you found a big word in the dictionary and could not wait to use it. Guess what? Using complicated words that do not really fit in the overall sentence representation will not help your score. Mostly because the word was used out of context. That means, instead of increasing your score, you actually deducted from the LR score. The examiner will look for proper word usage in the paragraphs. He will also be on the lookout for the smoothness of the word in the sentence. That means, the sentence has to feel natural when read. In this case, that did not happen.

This clear viewpoint aligns well with the prompt, focusing on the debate over the most vital innovation of recent decades. However, to enhance the essay, there are several key areas that need attention.

1. **Topic Engagement and Clarity**: The essay directly addresses the topic, which is a strength. To further improve, ensure that each paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence that summarizes the main idea. This will help in making the essay's argument more structured and easy to follow. For instance, rather than starting with a complex phrase, consider a straightforward sentence that introduces the main idea directly.

2. **Word Choice and Simplicity**: It's commendable to expand your vocabulary, but it's crucial to use words correctly and in context. For example, the use of ""athenaeum"" could be replaced with ""library"" for clarity and simplicity. This ensures the content is accessible and understandable, enhancing the coherence of your sentences. Aim for clear and concise language that accurately conveys your ideas.

3. **Sentence Structure and Grammar**: There are instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow of reading. For example, improving sentence structure and avoiding complicated sentence constructions can make your arguments more persuasive and easier to understand. It's also important to maintain consistency, such as using ""computers"" in the plural form correctly throughout the essay.

4. **Developing Arguments**: While you present supportive arguments for the importance of computers, developing these arguments with more detail and separating distinct ideas into different paragraphs could strengthen your essay. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea, providing clear and detailed support for your position. This approach will enhance the coherence and depth of your analysis.

5. **Avoiding Overgeneralization**: Be cautious of making broad statements without sufficient support. For example, when discussing the applications of computers in education and communication, providing specific examples and explaining their impact can make your argument more compelling and grounded in real-world applications.

In conclusion, your essay has a strong foundation in addressing the significance of computers in today's society.

While this practice could present issues relating to adverse risks to health, I contend that the fostering of closer collaboration among colleagues outweigh the such disadvantages. \n On the one hand, working in an open-space environment may leave staff susceptible to contagious disease. As they are situated closer together, a great deal of contact on a daily basis is inevitable. This, in the process, turns out to be a genuine cataclysm to the spread of various pathogens. A case in this point is Corona epidemic disease since companies applying open-space design witnessed a substantial increase in their employees' positive cases which could be alleviated in case of separate rooms. Consequently, their productivity was detrimentally affected, even leaving the companies bankrupted. As it shows, open offices have to confront the health problem. \n On the other hand, I believe that its social consolidation may stand a testimony to this innovation. Obviously, congregating in the same room could create ample opportunities for staff to converse with each other. This, therefore, could foster great inclusion in that employees could confide their troubles to their colleague as well as solve their problems relating to workload. A plethora of large companies nowadays divide their human resource into such major brand as Marketing or Administrative where specialized staff could work together in a large space. By that way the firms could not only engender better social relations but also contend with problems systematically. \n In conclusion, while applying open-space design to offices instead of separate rooms could face with several downsides, these are outweighed by the stimulation of collaboration and inclusion between employees.

The response to the topic is clear, and the essay provides arguments for both sides. However, there are several areas for improvement to make the essay stronger.

1. **Vocabulary Use**: The essay could benefit from a wider variety of vocabulary. Try to use different words to express your ideas. This not only demonstrates your language skills but also ensures your essay is engaging and precise. Avoid repeating words from the essay prompt or using overly common phrases. Expanding your vocabulary will help you convey your thoughts more effectively and avoid repetition.

2. **Argument Structure**: The approach to discussing the advantages and disadvantages of open-space offices is not fully effective. When presenting an argument, especially in a compare and contrast format (advantages vs. disadvantages), it is important to clearly establish your stance. After presenting a disadvantage, aim to refute it by explaining why and how it can be overcome or why it’s less significant, given the advantages. This makes your argument more convincing and shows deeper analytical thinking.

3. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues**: There are slight grammatical errors and stylistic choices that need attention. For example, ""outweigh the such disadvantages"" should be ""outweigh such disadvantages,"" and ""bankrupted"" should be ""bankrupt."" Pay attention to article use (a, an, the), verb tense consistency, and word choice to ensure clarity and precision. 

4. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay does present a clear point of view, arguing in favor of the benefits of open-space offices. However, strengthening this stance involves more than stating preferences; it requires the critical examination of opposing views and offering detailed reasons for why the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Incorporating examples or evidence strengthens your position and makes your viewpoint more persuasive.

5. **Supporting Arguments with Examples**: The arguments could be enhanced by providing more specific examples or evidence. For instance, when discussing the potential for increased collaboration in open-space offices, mention studies, real-world examples, or theoretical frameworks that support this claim. This adds credibility to your arguments and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic.

Making sure to clearly argue for one side or the other could strengthen your essay. However, it seems you lean towards saving money for a stable future, which is good but needs to be made clearer.

2. **Grammar and Style**:
   - There are some spelling and grammar errors in your essay. For example, ""belive"" should be ""believe"", and phrases like ""they does not think arough people need be help in your life"" are confusing. When writing in English, it's important to use the correct verb forms. ""They do not"" is correct, instead of ""they does not"".
   - Consider the sentence structure and try to use full sentences. For example, the sentence ""When they are sick they does not enough money pay to hospitalfree"" could be corrected to ""When they are sick, they do not have enough money to pay for hospital fees.""

3. **Point of View**:
   - Your opinion is somewhat clear but needs to be stated more strongly. Instead of saying ""I think I agree,"" confidently present your viewpoint right from the beginning. For example: ""I strongly believe that it's essential to save money for a stable future.""

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Language**:
   - Your first argument about why saving money is important is too brief. To meet the requirements of a well-developed essay, aim for at least 3-5 sentences per paragraph. This helps in elaborating your point and meeting the word count.
   - Try to expand on your ideas by providing specific reasons or examples. For instance, explain why having sufficient savings is important for family needs or in case of emergencies.

- Try to use more descriptive language to make your arguments clearer. 
- Revisit basic English grammar and sentence structure rules to help improve your writing significantly.

Although this might be achieved finally, it will take as long as a hundred years or even more. \n It is wholly true that the new language will become their priority to have higher education and better jobs that enhance the human life's standard. However, we all know that variety is the spice of life and language is related to culture. So, if we have one language spoken in the whole world, then it would be a dreary and dismal place to live in. \n In conclusion, although there would be benefits such as easy trade and travel, inventing a new language for international communication is not a good idea because of the various reasons given above. In my opinion, it is totally a waste of time and financial budget to make a new language due to the fact that its advantages cannot outweigh its disadvantages.","Do not alter the original theme of the discussion. The first paragraph of the task 2 essay always portrays your understanding and rendition of the original presentation. That paragraph should highlight your English comprehension skills only, it is not the part of the presentation where your reasoning discussion starts. As such, it should not contain any reference to a proven opinion, as you did in the first sentence. Such information is seen as altering the original presentation content and discussion intention. In the 1st paragraph you failed to directly respond to the question posed as well. That direct response would have set the tone for your discuss prior to the reasoning sentence topic presents. While the paraphrase was not off to a great start, it did show your comprehensive skills in relation to the discuss required. Next time avoid over statements and try to respond to the direct question before giving your thesis statement. \n You also have a tendency to not fully develop your explanations in relation to one another. This occured in the 2nd paragraph where you stated 2 topic sentences, without fully providing reasons and related examples. This paragraph would have also lowered your c&c score because of the missing discussion development. By the way, this is only a 4 paragraphs essay, not 5 paragraphs. The original prompt clearly stated a 2 paragraph reasoning presentation. You would have garnered a higher score if you focused on the explanation development of 2 separate reasons when compared to several discussion paragraphs that fail to meet scoring requirements.","Your essay provides an interesting viewpoint on the concept of introducing a new international language. Here are some suggestions to improve its structure, content, and alignment with the task requirements.

1. **Addressing the Topic Directly:**
Ensure your introduction directly addresses the prompt. Your essay should begin by clearly understanding the presented topic, without immediately revealing your viewpoint or conclusions. This initial section is crucial for showcasing your comprehension skills in English. To improve, start by paraphrasing the prompt or question to show you understand it, then introduce your thesis or main argument. Avoid starting with a proven opinion.

2. **Clarity and Development of Arguments:**
Your main arguments, while valid, require further development for clarity and impact. Each paragraph should focus on a single main idea. For example, when discussing the challenges of creating a new language, include specific reasons and examples to support your point. This approach will make your arguments more compelling and easier to follow. To enhance this aspect, aim to elaborate on why a new international language might not be eagerly adopted and the specific challenges in its promotion and learning.

3. **Structural Coherence:**
Your essay structure deviates from the expected format, comprising four paragraphs instead of the recommended two with well-developed reasoning. This might have affected the coherence and cohesion score. Next time, try to condense your arguments into two robust paragraphs focusing on distinct reasons supported by clear examples. This will not only adhere to the task requirement but also provide a more focused and effective argumentation.

4. **Language and Style Issues:**
There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout your essay. Pay attention to these areas by proofreading your work. For instance, keeping sentences clear and concise can help avoid confusion and improve the overall readability of your essay. Additionally, varying your sentence structure and vocabulary can make your writing more engaging.

5. **Perspective and Cultural Considerations:**
You've made an interesting point about the cultural implications of a universal language. This perspective is a strength of your essay. However, to enhance its effectiveness, consider exploring more about how diversity in language enriches cultures and individual experiences. Providing tangible examples can solidify your argument against a single global language.

In conclusion, your essay intriguingly tackles the topic but could benefit significantly from clearer argument structure, direct response to the essay prompt, and improved coherence and grammar. By focusing on developing each idea thoroughly and adhering to the structural requirements, your writing will become more persuasive and impactful.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

The proper representation for the opening statement would have that of a paraphrasing of the topic plus instructions for the discussion and then the presentation of your line of reasoning in the second paragraph. It is because of this mistake that your concluding essay came up short and, along with the missing paraphrase and discussion outline at the beginning, that you would most likely not get a passing grade for this essay in the actual test. Remember the proper discussion format for an IELTS task 2 essay and always follow it. That is how you can increase your test scores.","Your essay presents a thoughtful discussion on the timing of foreign language learning in children, specifically weighing the benefits of starting in primary school against potential drawbacks. However, for improvement, it's essential to refine the structure and address certain elements of your writing to enhance clarity and effectiveness.

First, regarding whether the essay responds to the topic, you introduce the debate on when children should begin learning a foreign language. Nonetheless, the essay could benefit from a clearer paraphrasing of the prompt at the beginning. This means restating the essay question in your own words, which helps set a focused direction for your argument. This approach not only clarifies the relevance of your discussion to the topic but also organizes your thoughts and the essay's structure from the outset.

On spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, your essay has room for improvement. Paying attention to grammatical accuracy, such as subject-verb agreement (""sometimes they are founded dazed"" should be ""sometimes they are found to be dazed""), and proper phrase construction, can significantly enhance readability. Also, remember to use more precise language (""optimal working"" could be more clearly expressed as ""optimal functioning"").

Regarding the clarity of your point of view, while you successfully express a personal stance by concluding that the merits of learning languages in primary school outweigh the demerits, this perspective could be stated more prominently earlier in the essay. Clearly outlining your viewpoint in the introduction after paraphrasing the prompt can guide the reader through your argument more effectively.

In terms of arguments supporting your point of view, you offer both sides of the debate, which is commendable for a balanced discussion. However, providing more detailed examples and evidence can strengthen your position. For instance, further elaboration on Rose Mini's findings or including statistical evidence or studies on language acquisition in children would make your argument more persuasive and concrete.

To conclude, reiterating your stance in the conclusion while summarizing the main points discussed adds coherence to your essay. Remember, an effective essay engages the topic from the introduction through to a strong conclusion, guided by clear, grammatically correct language and supported by well-evidenced arguments.

I absolutely disagree with this idea. \n In my view, it is extremely senseless to say that we no longer need libraries. I do not believe that we can go online anytime . What if we lived in uplands or in the countryside where there is no internet connection? In this case, if we don't have libraries and books, we will never be able to catch up with the latest news, and it is like we will live under the rock forever. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should not go to the libraries to read books. It costs us nothing to read the books we love. By borrowing books from libraries, we can save ourselves a fortune. \n I also disagree with the idea that we can easily access all information on the Internet. Nowadays, a range of people are using Internet to benefit themselves, even if they know what they are doing can harm others. For example, usually when you surf the Internet , you will see a lot of annoying advertisements, and they may disturb you and your search would be interrupted you. More seriously, they also can make your device viral if you accidentally click them. That's why the Internet can be convenient on one hand, but is not safe on the other hand. \n In conclusion, we would make a huge mistake if we eliminate libraries out of our life. I think we should spend more time in the libraries because it is not only the place to borrow books, but you also can find information you need safely.","this is a mere single opinion essay. It is not an emotional response essay. So your response should simply have been ""I disagree with the statement made."" You do not disagree with the idea because what was given in the prompt is a statement not an insinuation of an ""idea"". That is a simple mistake that is often made by new reviewers. You will need to brush up on the various discussion types for the IELTS essays so that you can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. \n Avoid using English terms and idioms like ""live under a rock"". This is first and foremost, an academic essay. Therefore, there must be an emphasis on the proper academic development of your sentences and statements. \n Limit your paragraphs to one discussion point at a time. Fully develop the topic sentence around the remaining 4 sentences by offering supporting reasons, information, and examples.

You maintain a clear stance throughout the essay, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the essay's overall effectiveness and adherence to academic standards.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay effectively responds to the prompt by asserting the continued importance of libraries. However, it's crucial to frame your response to this type of prompt more as a disagreement with a statement rather than opposition to an idea. This will ensure your essay aligns better with typical academic discussion formats.

2. **Language and Style**: While your passion for the subject is evident, it's important to remember the academic context of your essay. Phrases like ""live under the rock"" are colloquial and might detract from the academic tone expected in such essays. Strive for more formal expressions and avoid idiomatic language to maintain the appropriate register for academic writing.

3. **Structure and Development**: Your essay attempts to cover multiple points within individual paragraphs, which can make your arguments seem underdeveloped. Aim for a more structured approach by focusing on one main idea per paragraph and expanding upon it with supporting reasons, evidence, or examples. This will not only improve the clarity of your arguments but also the coherence and cohesion of your essay as a whole.

4. **Sentence Variety**: The essay currently features several long sentences that could hinder readability and comprehension. Working on crafting shorter, yet more complex sentences can improve the grammatical range and accuracy (GRA) score of your essay. Incorporating both simple and complex sentence structures will make your writing more dynamic and engaging.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion of your essay should more succinctly summarize the main points discussed, reinforcing why libraries are indispensable even in the digital age. A more effective conclusion might highlight the key benefits of libraries, such as access to information without the pitfalls of online advertising and their universal accessibility, compared to the internet. This not only ties your essay together but also strengthens your overall argument by succinctly recapping the discussed points.

Remember, the aim is to communicate your ideas as clearly and effectively as possible within an academic framework. By focusing on these areas for improvement, you'll be better equipped to develop a compelling and coherent argument in your essays.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

This essay will present some underlying reasons of this modern choice. \n To begin with, later age is widely perceived as perfect timing for upbringing a kid in terms of stable financial status. When young people have not settled down their career and life-long plans, they are not able to cope with a relatively burdening economic requirement of upbringing another individual. Consequently, the kids whose parents failed to provide adequate needs are in the sphere of lack of education, illnesses and social maladies. Moreover, the close relationships between family member are at risk due to the significant lack of time spent together since parents are involved in the nowadays incessant race to better salaries. \n In addition, parenting demands several integral skills whereas younger individuals are not fully up to scratch. Taking care of a child entails patience, sensibility and numerous other dignities. If one cannot adopt these characteristics, bringing up the kid will turn out to be extremely tiring and stressful. More seriously, these uncomfortable feelings can transform into aggressive reactions or even domestic violence cases which stem from the hatred of incapability. \n Opponents of this viewpoint may claim the negative effects of old-age pregnancy on the mother. However, this proposition is not completely convincing as modern convenience has offered much safer and affordable services which allow people to define their own perfect timing for parenthood. \n In conclusion, this trend is proven to have positive impact on the modern social world. Despite a few indiscernible flaws, it will assure a brighter and more civilised future for our next generations.","due to the fact that you did not understand the discussion prompt and you changed the discussion format for the essay, you will automatically receive a failing TA score. The TA score requires you to show a clear understanding of the discussion requirements by showing that you properly responded to the prompt question or represented the prompt discussion requirements. You failed to accomplish this task because the original discussion question was: \n <em>Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages? Why?</em> \n and your response was: \n <em>This essay will present some underlying reasons of this modern choice.</em> \n While your discussion topic representation is correct, the discussion response was so off the mark, I had no choice to give this essay a failing score for the TA section.

Learn from those presentations. Discover the right and wrong way to respond to specific prompt instructions. That is the only way you can pass the test. Familiarize yourself before you write any more practice tests.","The essay explored the trend of millennials choosing to have children at an older age, detailing reasons and implications. Here's how it can be improved:

1. **Addressing the Topic**: The prompt asks to discuss if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of the trend. However, the essay primarily focuses on explaining the reasons for the trend rather than comparing advantages and disadvantages directly. To align better with the prompt, restructure the essay to include clear sections that discuss both the positive and negative aspects equally and conclude which side outweighs the other. For instance, after explaining a reason for the trend, immediately contrast it with a potential disadvantage.

2. **Clarity and Style**: The essay sometimes uses complex sentences and terminology that can confuse the reader. Aim for simplicity and clarity in your writing. Shorter sentences and simpler words could make your arguments more accessible. For instance, instead of ""upbringing another individual,"" consider ""raising a child."" This ensures your message is easily understood, especially important for English language learner students.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor issues with tenses, agreement, and preposition use. For example, ""later age is widely perceived as perfect timing for upbringing a kid"" might be improved to ""a later age is widely perceived as the perfect time to raise a child."" Additionally, watch out for run-on sentences and consider breaking them into shorter, more digestible parts. 

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: While the essay provides reasons millennials may choose to have children later, it lacks detailed examination of disadvantages and how they compare to the benefits. To strengthen your arguments, include specific examples, statistics, or studies that support your points. Furthermore, make your viewpoint clearer by stating it early in the essay and reiterating it in your conclusion, ensuring the reader is aware of your stance on whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

5. **Point of View**: Your essay leans towards supporting the trend without thoroughly examining the opposing view. To present a balanced perspective, integrate a section that clearly outlines the disadvantages. Then, assess whether the advantages you've discussed outweigh these disadvantages, ensuring your point of view is explicit and backed by a comprehensive analysis of both sides.

By focusing on these areas, your essay will not only meet the prompt's requirements more closely but also be more coherent, persuasive, and easier to understand.

Some people insist citizens should pay for their own health costs respectively like private health insurance. The others prefer the free comprehensive health care system for public. As far as I am concerned, I would say the latter is better. \n Establishing free comprehensive health care system is the significant duty of governments. Citizen is the treasure of a country. Governments should take care of their people, undoubtedly the health care comes first. It is well known; most governments tax huge money every year. The money is from people, and should be used for people with on doubt. How serious will it be if a person always lives in a low quality of health condition, much less how terrible a country will be if most of the population in unhealthy condition generally. People are too weak to do their job, and have to see the doctor frequently. If so, not only they can't achieve their happiness, but also the county can't develop well. \n All the people will benefit much more from the free comprehensive health care system, rather than personal efforts. Governments are able to give more resources in addition to basic health care and treatment. Such as build all kinds of public gyms or stadiums nearby communities, provide free facilities for outdoor sports just within communities. Besides the above measures which are mainly for adults, the educational management department could increase sports courses at a school timetable, even get rid of the junk food from children's menus. By this kind of method, regardless of adults or children, their health care problems are all covered. More than that, no matter you're poor or wealthy, your health care problems are all covered as well. For example, even if you are very rich, you're probably not likely to build your own football pitch or basketball court, but the comprehensive health care system will help it. \n Having said that, the vast system has a few of disadvantages. The increasing cost will make it more difficult for governments to balance the budget. Consequently, the tax burden will become heavier for citizens. In addition, costly price of treatments may drive people do more exercise, whereas free health care might turn people more lazy. They would rather be couch potatoes than exercise regularly, in spite of the high risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and so on. These men waste public health care resources indeed. However, in any case citizens should have access to free health care. It's their basic human rights in my view. \n In conclusion, regarding less the inner shortage of the free comprehensive health care system, we should choose it and insist it, just as we cannot throw baby out with bath water.","Dear student, is this your first time writing an essay for task 2?

However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your argument stronger and your writing clearer to the reader. Here are specific points to focus on:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay addresses the given topic, presenting arguments in favor of a comprehensive health care system. To strengthen your response further, consider discussing contrasting viewpoints in more depth before refuting them with your own arguments. This will provide a more balanced perspective and make your position more compelling.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Your essay has numerous grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure and punctuation. These mistakes can make your essay difficult to understand. For example, phrases like ""Citizen is the treasure of a country"" could be rewritten for clarity and grammatical correctness to ""Citizens are a country's greatest treasure."" Also, pay attention to the use of conjunctions and prepositions to ensure sentences flow smoothly. I recommend using tools for grammar checking or consulting grammar guides to improve these areas.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view is clear, but it could be expressed more effectively with improved sentence structure and vocabulary. Avoid overly complex or convoluted sentences, as they can confuse the reader. Instead, aim for simplicity and clarity in expressing your ideas.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details:** While you've provided several arguments supporting your viewpoint, some points lack detailed evidence or examples. Strengthen your essay by including more specific evidence, such as statistics or real-world examples, to support your claims. Avoid making broad or unsupported generalizations. Additionally, consider addressing potential counterarguments more thoroughly to show a well-rounded understanding of the topic.

5. **Coherence and Cohesion:** Your essay sometimes lacks coherence due to abrupt transitions between ideas. Improve the flow of your essay by using transition words and phrases to link sentences and paragraphs. This will help guide the reader through your argument more smoothly.

6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion ties back to your argument, which is good. However, try to sum up your key points more succinctly and reinforce your stance without introducing new information.

While, I think this policy exerts many positive effects, I hold the opinion that that they should dedicated a part of their incoming to the governments' budget. \n On the one hand, there are some advantages of keeping money for their own. Firstly, most inhabitants live in large cities with high cost of living even though their income can be extremely low. Specifically, there would be likely be a variety of high quality goods and services accompanied by high prices, which means that to afford them, citizens need to work hard and save as much as possible. White collar workers in Vietnam, for instance, have spent over half of their monthly salary just on hiring small rooms in urban sprawls, which makes it convenient for them to commute to their working places. Without a saving plan for such payment, there is no way for them to inhibit in urban areas. Secondly, many city dwellers need to pay for entertainment services including mixing with their peers at the end of weeks or watching movies or travelling, which is extremely essential for getting motivated and refreshing themselves for next working weeks. Obviously, the more money, they can keep, the more things they can do to enjoy life better. \n On the other hand, I strongly believe that despites pressing issues of saving for every day expenses, as a citizen, allocating a small amount of money to the authority's budget not only benefit their nation but also for tax payers themselves. The first reason is that public money is likely to go to investments in building or upgrading infrastructures including roads, housing, bridges and specially tourist attraction. These new or updated facilities makes it possible for in habitants to travel quicker place to place within cities and have more things to relaxation. Another reason is that the government often gives priority to improve healthcare. Well-trained doctors, nurses and advanced medical technology eventually, for instance, can help those paying tax have longer life expectancy, thereby living a more happy life. \n In conclusion, despites the necessaries of keeping money for every day expenses, I believe that citizens should spend more or less money they earn on paying tax to receive better healthcare systems and infrastructures.","Dear student, you totally changed the discussion prompt for this essay. It appears to me that you misunderstood the prompt question, which is why you ended up giving the wrong response as an opinion for discussion. Let's compare the original prompt topic, reason, and instruction with what you wrote in the opening paraphrase: \n Original topic: people should keep all the money they earn \n Reason: sould not pay taxes to the state \n Opinion Question: Do you agree or disagree? \n Your topic: citizens should save all the money they earn (CORRECT) \n Reason: should not give tax for their authority (Wrong) \n Discussion Opinion: While, I think this policy exerts many positive effects, I hold the opinion that that they should dedicated a part of their incoming to the governments' budget. (Wrong) \n Let me explain the 2 mistakes in your opening statement. \n 1. The opinion is that people should not give taxes to the government. When you say ""give tax for their authority"", you mean to say that they have to pay taxes in order to have some sort of power over something like say, the government. That is wrong. What you should have said was ""pay taxes to authorities."" That is the phrase that best paraphrases the original prompt. \n 2. The instruction is for you to pick one opinion, either you agree or disagree, you can never say your opinion covers both sides as this is a single opinion essay, and then discuss the singular opinion that you support with justifications and reasonings. Your reasoning is nowhere near the required response. This is not a comparison essay, which is the manner you discussed it in. So you would get a failing score in terms of task accuracy, which could lead to an overall failing score for the essay as well. \n Sample paraphrase for this essay: \n <em>There has been an ongoing discussion as to whether or not people should pay taxes for money they earn. People tend to analyze if it is proper to ask people to compensate the government for their earnings through taxes. I don't agree with this statement due to a few reasons.</em> \n Try to use replacement words that would help you restate the original prompt in a manner closer in meaning to the original. Be careful of your word choices because if you use a word that sounds correct but has a different meaning, you end up changing the prompt for the discussion. I believe that is what happened in this instance and it can be easily avoided if you can manage to better understand the requirements of the original prompt and you have the opportunity to carefully choose the words you will use in the opening paraphrase.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the topic of whether citizens should save all the money they earn versus contributing part of their income in taxes to the government. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, accuracy, and adherence to the essay prompt.

1. **Adherence to the Essay Topic:** It seems there was a misinterpretation of the original essay prompt. The task was to express an opinion on whether people should pay taxes from the money they earn, but the essay attempted to cover both perspectives, which deviated from the requirement of stating a clear, singular viewpoint. It is crucial to closely match the essay's argument to the prompt by choosing either an agreement or disagreement and then elaborately justifying that stance. A more appropriate approach would be to state explicitly whether you agree or disagree with the notion of paying taxes and then defend this opinion throughout the essay.

2. **Clarity and Accuracy of Language:** The essay suffers from several spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues that can confuse readers. Phrases such as ""give tax for their authority"" and ""should dedicated a part of their incoming"" are incorrect and misleading. Instead, using clearer and more accurate language such as ""pay taxes to the government"" would greatly improve understanding. Paying close attention to word choice is essential, as well as ensuring that verbs match their subjects in number and tense.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The essay's perspective becomes blurred due to the attempt to discuss both sides of the argument. For a stronger piece, it's important to present a clear stance early on and maintain that perspective throughout, backed by coherent arguments and examples. Streamlining the essay to focus on either the advantages or disadvantages, depending on the chosen stance, would enhance its effectiveness.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** There are attempts to support the essay's points with examples and reasoning, such as the high cost of living in cities or the benefits of tax contributions to public services. However, these arguments need to be more clearly connected to the main thesis to reinforce the chosen stance. Additionally, providing more detailed examples and ensuring they directly support the essay's main argument will make the reasoning more persuasive and impactful.

In conclusion, focusing on a precise interpretation of the essay prompt, employing correct and clear language, presenting a consistent point of view, and offering well-supported arguments are key areas for improvement.

They really do not care much about the colors surroundings that are impossible to suit everyone's expectation. So, the presence of colors sometimes is unnecessary. \n In terms of hospitals, it is effortless to realize that the colors do not attract patients and doctors a lot because of their different concerns. In fact, doctors are so busy in treatment that there is no time to pay attention to colors. While resting and relaxing is more important for patients to recover their health, visitors just pop up to check the state of their relatives. In most hospitals in my country, white is one of the favorite colors used to paint in treatment rooms. The reason is to save money at maximum to boost the quality of treatment while obviously, it does not matter what colors the surroundings are. \n In conclusion, the idea of psychologists for a long time has been that colors can affect people's feelings and need to be paid attention in using in offices and hospitals. However, I believe that office workers are quite busy with their own goals while hospitals' staffs and patients have a lot of others to consider.","There are 2 questions that need a response representation in your thesis section. You responded to the first one, regarding the truth of the statement, but failed to represent a topic response regarding the degree of influence that color has on people's worth ethic and health. For a clear representation of your opinion, you should present 2 sentences that are composed of the topics you plan to discuss in the reasoning paragraphs. Doing so will increase your TA score as you create a complete thesis presentation for that section. \n The first reasoning paragraph does not relate to the colors in its presentation. Therefore, the response is incorrect. The second reason, in relation to hospitals makes sense and is acceptable as a supporting discussion based on your reason. However, you do not give a true measure as to how little the color scheme affects the said subjects. If it does not influence the workplace, then explain why, the same way that you did for the hospital discussion.","Your essay presents a unique perspective on the influence of colors in environments like offices and hospitals. Here's some feedback to help improve your work:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay addresses an interesting aspect of psychology concerning how colors can impact people's feelings. Nonetheless, it seems you have only considered part of the topic.  The essay could be enhanced by directly addressing the influence that color has on people's work ethic and health in addition to their overall feelings. Clarifying your stance on these points within the introduction would make your thesis stronger.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: Your writing is generally clear, but there are some areas where sentences could be more concise or structured differently for clarity. For instance, consider breaking up longer sentences into shorter ones to make your arguments easier to follow. Be mindful of maintaining consistent tense throughout your essay and double-check the pluralization of words (e.g., ""staffs"" should be ""staff"").

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View**: While your viewpoint against the significant impact of colors is noted, it would be beneficial to express it more definitively in the introduction. This will guide your readers through your argumentation more smoothly. 

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your argument regarding the limited impact of colors in offices and hospitals is interesting. However, the reasoning in the office environment segment lacks a direct connection to the central thesis about colors. It would be more convincing if you explained why colors in offices don’t greatly affect people, similar to how you discussed hospitals. Providing specific examples or evidence can strengthen your argument. 

To specifically improve the first reasoning paragraph, directly relate your discussion back to how colors (or the lack thereof) influence office workers' focus, mood, or productivity. This direct connection is missing, making your argument less compelling. In contrast, your discussion about hospitals is on a better track but could be enhanced by quantifying or detailing how little color schemes affect those within the hospital to strengthen your argument.

In conclusion, refining your thesis to cover all aspects of the topic, ensuring clarity and consistency in your writing, and strengthening your argumentation with direct evidence or clearer logic will greatly improve your essay. These adjustments will also help in making your point of view more persuasive and engaging to the reader.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Therefore, efforts to conserve animals can be a meaningless and squander of resources; nevertheless, I firmly believe that the existence of wild life plays an indispensable role in human life. This essay will point out reasons for my statement. \n To begin with, animals provide mankind with a great amount of scientific resources. Many elements contained in body of wild species are really valuable in the process of researching science, especially in biology and chemistry. To illustrate, genetic code of monkey and gorilla, which has lots of similarities to human's one, is used ubiquitously in process of developing medicine as well as curing methods for man. Besides, white mouse has been considered as one of the most ideal samples for most of medical experiments since the laboratory was established. \n Furthermore, the survival of wild animals have always related directly to the existence of all species. If there are too many animals die out, the diversity of eco-system will be destroy, consequently, the loss of biodiversity will not only put human but also all kinds of living creatures at risks of extinction. For instance, pollination of many plants cannot be happened without participation of insects such as butterflies or bees, this will lead to the disappearance of worldwide flora. Moreover, without animals, people will have no milk to drink, no pets to raise and no meat to eat. \n In conclusion, due to the need of wild animals in biodiversity and scientific research. It is obvious that appearances of these species in this era put a blessing than a burden to mankind, therefore, people need to protect them even if it consume lots resources.","<quotation>resources; nevertheless, I firmly believe</quotation> \n Since you are now expressing your response opinion, this thought needs to stand out.

However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity and effectiveness.

First, it is essential to ensure your essay directly responds to the topic. You have done this well by stating your position clearly at the beginning. However, instead of combining your response with other thoughts, consider presenting it as a stand-alone statement for greater impact. For example, after expressing your opinion, start a new sentence for the subsequent idea. This will help your main points stand out more clearly to the reader.

When expressing the importance of wild animals for scientific research and biodiversity, try to avoid informal language such as ""lots."" Instead, use more formal synonyms like ""numerous"" or ""marked"" to maintain an academic tone throughout your essay. This small change can significantly enhance the professionalism of your writing.

Your essay's structure could be improved by addressing issues with sentence structure and grammar. For instance, when you mention the destruction of the ecosystem, remember to use the passive voice correctly (""will be destroyed"") and ensure each idea is clearly separated into its own sentence. This will help avoid confusion and make your arguments more persuasive.

Additionally, it's important to pay attention to verb tense consistency. Avoid mixing past and present tenses inappropriately, as it can disrupt the flow of your essay. For example, rather than saying ""pollination of many plants cannot be happened,"" you should use the present tense, ""pollination of many plants cannot happen,"" to maintain consistency and clarity.

To conclude, your essay highlights crucial points about the necessity of protecting wild animals for the sake of biodiversity and scientific research. Focusing on enhancing the academic tone of your writing, refining your sentence structure, and correcting grammatical errors will significantly improve the quality of your essay. By addressing these areas, you can develop a more coherent and compelling argument that effectively communicates the importance of wildlife conservation.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

This might derive from several factors, which will be elaborated in detail by this essay, including the possible solutions to overcome those significantly. \n Looking to the underlying factors of this problem, at least there are two main reasons. Firstly, this is probably influenced by economic pressure, which it is mostly related to jobless condition. In this case, the youngsters, because they do not have a job, might be difficult to meet their daily needs which are increasingly complex today. Therefore, this situation tends to stimulate them to get something through an illegal way, such as larceny and robbery. Moreover, another reason is potentially influenced by lack of family closeness. This is sometimes noticeable on dual-income or wealthy family, in which the parents are really busy with their job or business, and likely to neglect their children. As the result, the young people might possibly abuse their wealth on what could entertain them, such as gambling or drug consumption. \n Considering the possible solutions, there are several strategic ways which could be taken to handle directly the root of causes. The first is through providing a number of skill trainings, especially for youngsters, as a preventive way to prepare themselves for finding a job. Besides, these programmes could be also being rehabilitative method, when the young people have further involved within a gengster. Secondly, the most helpful strategy for reducing youth crime is potentially by building supportive parenting behaviour, inside of family life itself. This solution would greatly strengthen the family closeness by affection, warmth, hearing and understanding children's view and experience outside home. As the result, the youth's activities would be controlled more persuasively and openly. \n To conclude, youth crime rate having increased today is influenced by two main reasons, such as economic pressure and lack of family closeness.

That said, I did notice a number of problem points in your body paragraphs. \n the major problem with your body paragraph discussion is that you have too many topics going on in one paragraph. This has led to a weak development of your reasoning and justification skills for each point that you presented. The paragraphs turn out to be half baked or under-developed because there is no real point to your line of reasoning. That is why there is a single topic per paragraph requirement.

However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance its effectiveness and clarity.

1. **Response to Topic:** Without the original prompt, it's challenging to evaluate how well the essay addresses the requested topic. In the future, include the original prompt for a more accurate assessment. Ensuring your essay directly responds to the prompt is crucial for meeting test requirements.

2. **Organization and Development:** The essay attempts to cover multiple issues within single paragraphs, leading to underdeveloped arguments. To strengthen your essay, focus on one main idea per paragraph. Start with a clear topic sentence, followed by at least four sentences that expand on that idea, using examples or further explanation. This structure not only makes your writing easier to follow but also allows you to develop your arguments more thoroughly, which is important for both your reasoning and the overall coherence of your essay.

3. **Clarity and Coherence:** The introduction and conclusion contain sentences that are too complex and long, making them difficult to follow. Aim for clear and concise sentences, especially in these essential sections of your essay. A well-structured paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences. This approach not only meets the requirement but also improves the readability of your essay. By breaking down complex ideas into simpler sentences, you make your essay more accessible to the reader.

4. **Grammar and Style:** There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay. Paying closer attention to these aspects can significantly improve the professional appearance and readability of your work. Consider using tools or seeking help to identify and correct these errors.

5. **Perspective and Argumentation:** While the essay presents a clear viewpoint and identifies critical issues contributing to youth crime, the arguments are somewhat broad and lack specific examples or evidence that could strengthen them. Enhancing your essay with more precise details or statistics about the issues discussed would make your arguments more compelling and persuasive.

6. **Solution-Focused:** The essay does well to propose solutions to the problems identified. However, expanding on how these solutions could be implemented, or offering examples of where similar approaches have been successful, could make this section more impactful.

Constructive improvement in these areas will significantly enhance the effectiveness, clarity, and persuasiveness of your essay.

However, this idea is not entirely straightforward. Some people argue the opposite side because of several reasons. This essay will discuss the debate and give a concluding view. \n On the one hand, those who support study in boarding schools believe some educational benefits children can have. This includes an extra focus on study and more participation in extracurricular activities. Another argument is children will develop some good characteristics while studying in boarding schools. For instance, care and responsibility. These qualities might be induced in children because they have to take care of their daily routine tasks on their own. Finally, it might be said that children will learn to be independent. As a result of this, they will learn a lot of life skills as they try to take care of their needs. \n On the other hand, opponents of this view, point out that children will have a lack of parent's care and love if they choose to study in boarding schools. Another reason is some children may feel homesickness sometimes as they are residing away from family. This may result in stress or some mental health problems for children.

1. The introduction should be clearer. For instance, rephrase the first sentence to specify that boarding schools are considered the best places for children to study, not the best for study in general. This minor adjustment can significantly improve the precision of your statements.

2. It’s important to properly align the essay with the comparative discussion format typical of English proficiency tests. Instead of simply concluding, the essay should include a personal opinion paragraph that presents your own viewpoint before the concluding paragraph. This adds depth to your analysis and meets the test requirements more accurately.

3. The concluding paragraph should summarize the discussed points more effectively. It’s crucial to clarify that this paragraph is not for introducing new ideas or conclusions but for summarizing the previously mentioned arguments and your personal stance if required by the essay prompt.

4. Attention to detail in spelling, coherence, and cohesiveness will improve the overall quality of the essay. Errors in these areas can distract readers and impact the essay's effectiveness. Proofreading more carefully can help identify and correct these issues.

Here's a detailed review focusing on the requested aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   The essay successfully addresses a relevant discussion—whether sports should be mandatory in schools, highlighting the benefits of physical education for students. However, the essay would benefit greatly from a clearer introduction that outlines the debate more distinctly and presents a thesis statement. This would provide a stronger foundation for your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
   There are several areas where the essay could improve in terms of language and style. For instance:
   - Be mindful of verb agreements and spelling. Phrases like ""flitter time"" likely intended ""fritter away time,"" and ""opportune metal health"" seems to be ""opportune mental health.""
   - Use of specific terms needs clarity. For example, replacing ""aggrandize"" with a more appropriate term like ""improve"" or ""enhance"" could make your argument clearer.
   - Simplify language to maintain clarity and ensure your argument is easily understood. For example, instead of saying ""Sport is not only improved physical health but also promote mental clarity,"" consider ""Sport improves not only physical health but also mental clarity.""
   
3. **Point of View Clarity:**
   Your stance on the importance of sports in education is clear; however, your arguments could be strengthened by directly addressing counterarguments. Acknowledging opposing views and providing reasoned responses would deepen the essay's persuasive power.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:**
   Your essay outlines general benefits of sports in schools, mentioning physical health and mental well-being. To enhance this, avoid referring to vague studies or generalized statements from doctors without specific citations, as these may weaken your argument's credibility. Instead, focus on well-known benefits and, if possible, personal experiences or observations to support your claims. Refrain from making specific health-related claims (like reducing diabetes risks) unless they're widely recognized and easily verifiable.

**Additional Advice:**
- The essay could benefit from a more structured layout, with clear paragraphs for each main point. Consider introducing your key arguments in the introduction, elaborating on them in separate paragraphs, and summarizing your viewpoint conclusively in the conclusion.
- Balancing the presentation of ideas with simple language and clear, concrete examples will enhance the effectiveness of your essay.

There's a missed opportunity in the introductory paragraph to outline the ""why"" behind the given viewpoint, which is crucial for setting up the essay's arguments.

In terms of vocabulary and clarity, the essay encounters some challenges. Phrases such as ""male playground"" or references to ""man sports"" can confuse readers due to unclear meaning or incorrect terminology.

Although many governmental efforts have been made to tackle this problem, financial investments in promoting a healthy lifestyle can be viewed as an ultimate approach. \n Governments can achieve many unexpected advantages in the long run by helping their citizens have a healthy lifestyle. First, it will eventually reduce substantially the average medical expenditure the governments spend on an annual basis. For example, Mexico was able to save up to one billion dollars on medical bills last year to deal with their citizens' chronic diseases by building more public gyms. Second, given the immense medical pressure local hospitals have to take, raising awareness of a good lifestyle would be an ideal solution. In fact, if people pay more attention to get rid of bad habits to the health, the need for medical attention will decrease considerably. \n Another compelling reason why public spending should be used to guide people to healthy habits is how easy it is to implement with a great rate of success. First, just by offering some small financial rewards, citizens will be motivated to do physical activities that are beneficial to their body. For instance, Japanese people are required to do ten squats in order to use subway services for free, which contributes to build a greater well-being. In addition, if the governments can build more free gyms with the state of the art facilities, it will incentivize more people to embark on carb-burning activities. In fact, it has been proved successful in Malaysia with a 55% more office workers doing exercise when the governments eliminated fees in city gyms. \n In conclusion, given the high efficiency and great likelihood of success, the governments should take steps to ensure their citizens having a healthy lifestyle.","Dear student, the score for this essay is a 3. The main reason why this essay failed overall is because you did not discuss the required topic in the body of the essay. You created your own prompt question and decided to answer that.

Rather than discussing an extent essay, you chose to discuss methods by which a healthy lifestyle can be promoted instead. Nothing about your opening paraphrase falls under the expected discussion requirements. The topic you chose to discuss is not even part of the original prompt. Therefore, the essay cannot pass the test. It will be useless for me to point out the errors in the other sections of your essay because it makes no difference in the final outcome of your score. This essay is a failure and will not pass the main scoring considerations.","The essay makes a strong case for government investments in promoting a healthy lifestyle as a strategy to combat lifestyle-induced diseases. However, to improve and ensure the essay aligns more closely with typical English proficiency test expectations, focus on the essay's alignment with the prompt, clarity of argument, and language use.

1. **Responding to the Prompt:**
   The essay veers off from directly addressing a common type of prompt found in English proficiency tests, which often ask you to discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with a statement. Instead, the essay focuses on advocating for a specific solution: governmental investment in promoting healthy lifestyles. For future essays, ensure that your response closely aligns with the task given. If the prompt asks for your agreement or disagreement, structure your essay to explicitly state and explore your position in relation to the statement provided in the prompt.

2. **Clarity and Organization:**
   The essay is well-organized into paragraphs, each beginning with a clear topic sentence that introduces the argument to be discussed. To enhance clarity, consider adding more explicit transitions that guide the reader from one idea to the next, making the progression of your arguments smoother.

3. **Language and Style Issues:**
   The essay is generally well-written but watch out for minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as ""if people pay more attention to get rid of bad habits to the health."" It might be clearer to say, ""if people pay more attention to eliminating unhealthy habits."" Aim for simplicity and clarity in your language to effectively convey your arguments.

4. **Supporting Arguments:**
   The essay provides several persuasive examples and reasons why government investment in healthy lifestyles is beneficial. However, to strengthen your essay, ensure that each argument is clearly supported by specific evidence and that your examples directly tie back to your central thesis. Additionally, adding a counter-argument or acknowledging potential limitations of government investment could provide a more balanced perspective and demonstrate critical thinking.

5. **Point of View:**
   Your stance on the importance of governmental efforts in promoting healthy lifestyles is clear throughout the essay. To enhance the strength of your position, consider more explicitly stating your level of agreement or disagreement in response to a hypothetical prompt at the beginning of your essay. This clarity will help your essay directly confront the task at hand.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Your conclusion effectively summarizes the key points made within your essay. For further improvement, consider restating your main argument in a powerful way that emphasizes the significance of your findings and leaves a lasting impression on your reader.

By focusing on these aspects, future essays can be more effectively tailored to meet the expectations of English proficiency tests, demonstrating both your understanding of the prompt and your ability to construct a cohesive and compelling argument.",4,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

In my opinion, I believe that both sports types can provide people with a variety of benefits and that they should choose the appropriate type of sport for them. \n On the one hand, an advantage of team sports is that they can develop interpersonal skills for individuals. For example, football allows people to better understand and communicate with each other, which benefits them in the workplace. In addition, improving the sense of unity, and friendship between teammates makes them more responsible, and more enthusiastic when working. \n On the other hand, playing individual sports like swimming or tennis also has its benefits. Individual sports provide more opportunities for people to improve their skills, such as emotion management or self-esteem. Because no one can assist single players during a match, they must work hard to overcome any setbacks they may face to achieve their goals. For instance, swimmers have to practice really hard to achieve high results like winning an Olympics medal. \n In conclusion, both team sports and single one have their own benefits, people should choose the sport they are most interested in playing.","The writer has not written enough words to merit a passing score. At 217 words where 250 is the minimum consideration, the writer has not provided enough samples of his writing skills, logical thinking, and discussion abilities to convince the examiner that he can function in an English academic setting. The lack of proper English grammar, sentence formation, and understandable (not confusing) English sentences are highly evident in this essay, all of which will add to the reasons that the writer cannot be considered for a base passaing score. \n The opening paraphrase alone contains several sentences of confusing thought presentations. My guess is, the writer is thinking in his native tongue and then translating it word for word in English, which is why some essential English words necessary for proper explanations are missing. \n As far as the actual discussion is concencerned, the writer does not completely develop the dual aspect of the viewpoints to help clarify the public and personal opinions He is only explaining based on his own perceptions of the topic. It is this lack of dual sided considerations that also prevented him from achieving the word count requirement. If only writes from only a personal opinion perspective, the essay will be considered under developed and lacking in substance. It means the writer did not understand what discussion format and topic opinions should be present in the task. \n The writer has good personal opinions but the essay demands more evidence of the validity of his opinion. Something that is achieved only be proving that the other side of the discussion, the public opinion as understood and explained by the writer, in comparison to his own.

It's clear that effort was made to cover both sides of the sports argument. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the essay's effectiveness and meet the requirements for a proficiency test.

Firstly, the essay falls short of the expected word count, which is a minimum of 250 words for most proficiency tests. It's crucial to meet this requirement as it gives you ample room to showcase your writing skills, logical thinking, and ability to discuss the topic comprehensively. Consider expanding your discussion by incorporating examples, counterarguments, or elaborating on the points already made to reach or exceed the word limit.

There are noticeable grammar, sentence structure, and stylistic issues within the essay that could hinder its clarity and flow. Simplifying complex ideas and using straightforward sentence structures can make the essay easier to understand. Ensuring correct grammar usage will also greatly improve your essay’s presentation.

The point of view is somewhat clear, as you've shared your opinion that both types of sports have their benefits. However, the essay would benefit from a more balanced discussion that includes not just personal opinions but also a consideration of wider public opinions or research findings. This approach can help strengthen your argument and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Additionally, while the essay mentions benefits of team and individual sports, these points could be more developed and supported with clear, descriptive arguments. For instance, mentioning studies, statistics, or specific real-life examples can make your arguments more convincing. Developing these points further will not only help with the word count but also provide a stronger, more compelling case for your viewpoint.

In conclusion, focusing on expanding the content to meet the word count, improving grammar and sentence structure, and enriching the argument with a balanced discussion and stronger evidence can transform this essay into a more convincing and proficient piece.

Not only it provides children skills and knowledge they need for their future life, it also guilds them to be an exemplar civilian that contribute to global development. Despite this, students behaviors are still the most critical issue that worried schools throughout the world, and various remedies have been address to tackle this problem. \n Many people hold a belief that schools are responsible for their students poor behaviors, but in my opinion, the problem lies in their family. Either they are spoilt or get neglected. In the first scenario, if students come from a wealthy family, their parents will give them everything they want regardless of price and reason. This kind of children grew up without consideration for others, and thus treating everyone as inferiors. In other words, these kids don't have to follow any rule. On the other hand, the kids that don't get enough care tend to act up for attention. Furthermore, they lacks parental guidance and more easily influenced by exterior factors such as bad friends. Both parenting styles are problematic, and if they continue, they will hinder kids moral compass. \n A good solution to this issue is to have periodic parents meetings or discuss the children attitude with their parents. In both situations, parents don't seem to aware of the wrongdoings, most likely because they are too busy, and should be reminded that their kids emotional and social lives matter too, not just their material one. Spending quality times with children, applying discipline and having talks about their behaviors can fix the problem, since no one other than parents have more influence on their kids. \n To summarize, parents presence in students lives is more important than many may consider. Lacking parents support can leads to many negative consequences in kids. Perhaps classes in parenting where parents and child learn to communicate better will come in handy in terms of raising the next generation.","The prompt restatement is over presented to the point where the author already shares personal insights on the topic.

Those are the topics for cause and solutions.","The essay begins by stating the importance of education in modern society, highlighting its role in providing children with necessary skills and knowledge, and guiding them to become contributing members of global development. However, the introduction directly delves into personal insights about the causes of students' poor behaviors, which is not ideal. The introduction should instead focus on a brief restatement of the prompt followed by an outline of the discussion. This approach saves detailed insights for the body of the essay, thereby meeting the task requirement more effectively.

In response to the topic, the essay argues that the primary cause of students' poor behavior lies within the family due to either being spoiled or neglected. It is suggested that solutions include periodic parent meetings and discussions about children's attitudes. However, the essay does not fully address the prompt's requirement to focus on the responsibility of schools regarding students' behaviors. It overlooks the role of schools in disciplining students and ensuring adherence to codes of conduct, which are crucial elements in managing students' behaviors on-site. Addressing the impact of school policies, guidance counselors, and disciplinary actions would enrich the essay and align it more closely with the prompt.

On the grammatical and stylistic front, the essay exhibits a few issues that need correction:
- ""guilds them to be an exemplar civilian that contribute to global development"" should be corrected to ""guides them to become exemplary civilians who contribute to global development.""
- ""students behaviors"" should be ""students' behaviors,"" and ""remedies have been address"" should be ""remedies have been addressed.""
- The essay occasionally uses singular nouns with plural verbs or vice versa, for example, ""they lacks parental guidance"" should be ""they lack parental guidance.""

The point of view is clear throughout the essay; however, more descriptive arguments and examples relating to the school’s responsibilities could strengthen the position. Adding specific examples of how schools can address behavioral issues, the role of guidance counselors, and the significance of school discipline policies would provide a more rounded argument that considers both familial and educational influences on student behavior.

In conclusion, focusing on both family and school roles, correcting grammatical errors, and structuring the essay to address the prompt directly would substantially improve the essay. Encouraging a more balanced view that also considers the school's ability to influence student behavior will make for a more compelling and comprehensive argument.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Specificity in Arguments: While you mentioned the group's vocal abilities and performance skills, including specific examples or instances where these talents were particularly evident would strengthen your argument. For example, mentioning a song where their vocals stand out or a specific performance that showcases their teamwork and dance abilities.
3. Grammatical and Stylistic Issues: Your essay is generally well-written, but watch out for repetitive phrases and aim for variety in your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. Additionally, revising your essay to ensure subject-verb agreement and correct use of plural and singular nouns will help maintain clarity. For instance, consider specifying the members as individuals when discussing their talents or incidents, especially when focusing on a singular subject as per the essay prompt.
4. Descriptive Language: Increase the use of descriptive language to vividly convey why you admire the member you choose. This can include detailing their personality traits, specific contributions to the group, or moments when they particularly inspired you.

Avoiding filler phrases that do not add value to the argument will help make the essay more concise and impactful.

3. **Clarity of Author's Viewpoint:** The author's viewpoint is generally clear: the convenience and comfort of cars contribute to their use despite environmental concerns, and solutions include higher taxation and promoting public transportation. However, for a more robust essay, it's important to explicitly state these points and ensure each paragraph supports the viewpoint effectively.

4. **Support for Argument:** The essay provides reasons for the continued use of cars and suggests solutions.

First, the essay's length could be increased to enhance scoring potential. Aim for at least 275 words to not only meet but exceed minimum requirements, allowing a fuller assessment of writing skills according to the scoring rubric.

The discussion in the essay somewhat lacks focus and clarity. While attempting to address the advantages and disadvantages of government spending on education, the insertion of loosely related details detracts from the essay's coherence. For greater effectiveness, maintain a focused discussion on how government spending affects the economy and society in one paragraph and then specifically how it impacts children's education and national development in another. This structured approach will help in clearing the main arguments and supporting them with relevant examples or evidence.

Regarding content and coherence, ensure each paragraph aligns closely with the main idea it intends to support. For example, when discussing the negative economic and societal impacts of government spending on education, stay focused on that topic, providing clear examples and avoiding unrelated information. The same applies to discussing the positive outcomes of such investments.

The conclusion could be strengthened by incorporating a ""reverse paraphrase."" This means revisiting the main topic, summarizing the key reasons discussed, and reiterating the overarching stance or suggestion. This will provide a stronger, more cohesive ending to the essay.

On grammar and style, there are minor spelling and grammar mistakes that need attention, such as ""favourble"" should be ""favorable,"" and ensuring the correct use of apostrophes and article usage (""a"" and ""the""). Improving these will enhance the readability and professionalism of the essay.

The perspective of the essay author is evident, advocating for the advantages of investing in children's education. However, sharpening the focus on how these arguments are laid out and ensuring cohesive development of ideas will make the stance even clearer and more persuasive.

By refining these areas, the essay will not only meet scoring requirements more effectively but also provide a richer, more compelling discussion on the topic.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Firstly ,young people are able to earn money as soon as possible >by this way ,they will be more independent and be able to pay all costs. Secondly,a person who get a job straight may progress rapidly in their carrer. This brings a good chance to gain more experiences and skills for their profession \n On the other hand,I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies .First ,many positions are required academic qualification. Thus ,university graduates will probably get a much higher salary than those without university education .Furthermore, the job market is getting more and more competitive so the recruiter are likely to be hard with young people who do not get a degree. \n In conclusion,it seems to me that in the long term, it is better for young generation to choose their studies instead of getting a job.","This essay would get an automatic failing score based solely on the limited word count. Writing 200 out of 250 words means the word count deductions will be so severe, your essay may not be able to achieve a passing score. Your paragraphs are incompletely presented and developed. There is no comparison of the 2 public points of view, prior to your personal opinion presentation. The essay does not follow the either of the required writing formats. The acceptable formats are: \n - Topic + Discussion of public opinion + Personal opinion of the public opinion + explanation + supporting example (optional) \n - 1st point of view topic + public explanation + example (done twice for both public viewpoints) then the personal opinion presentation \n The concluding summary is too short. It does not reflect a proper 40 word (minimum) summary of the discussion presentation. This essay does not work as a discussion presentation for these reasons. In your future essays, focus on increasing your word count first. Once you already write more than 250 words (275-290 being ideal), then you can focus on the discussion format and content presentation.","Your essay addresses the topic of choosing between getting a job immediately after school or continuing education. However, there are several areas where improvements are crucial for a more effective essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** You have addressed the topic, but your arguments could be more comprehensive and detailed. Consider expanding on both viewpoints before stating your opinion, as this approach will make your essay more persuasive and thorough.

2. **Word Count and Development:** Your essay is under the required word count, which can significantly impact your score. Essays should be at least 250 words to avoid penalties. Aim for between 275 to 290 words for a more developed discussion. Each paragraph needs to be more fully developed to present the arguments effectively. More precisely, you could benefit from adding a comparison of public opinions before presenting your stance. 

3. **Format and Structure:** The essay does not follow the recommended structure for presenting arguments and personal opinions adequately. Here are two acceptable formats you might consider for future essays:
   - Introduce the topic, discuss public opinion, share your personal viewpoint with explanations, and provide supporting examples if possible.
   - For each point of view: introduce the topic, explain the public perspective with an example, then present your personal opinion. Repeat for the contrasting viewpoint before concluding.
Adopting one of these formats will help improve the clarity and effectiveness of your arguments.

4. **Concluding Summary:** Your conclusion is too brief. A well-rounded summary should be at least 40 words, giving a concise recap of the discussed viewpoints and your personal opinion. This will ensure your essay concludes on a strong note, reinforcing the points made.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Be mindful of small errors, such as ""people 's opinions"" which should be ""people's opinions,"" and ""carrer"" instead of ""career."" Pay attention to punctuation and avoid using "">"" as it breaks the formal tone of the essay. Also, ensure all sentences are complete and that verb tenses remain consistent to maintain clarity.

6. **Clarity and Support for Arguments:** Make your point of view as clear as possible and support it with detailed reasons and examples. While you mention several advantages of both working and continuing studies, elaborating on these points with specific examples will strengthen your argument.

7. **Actionable Steps:** For your future essays:
   - Aim to meet or exceed the minimum word count.
   - Use a structured format to organize your essay logically.
   - Develop your arguments fully with clear supporting examples.
   - Conclude with a summary that encapsulates your discussion effectively.
   - Proofread for spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes.

Although the government have taken measures to improve the matter, there some believe that it is too late to reverse the consequences. But in my point of view, living creatures still could be saved, and we need to take effective remedies to make that happen. \n On the one hand, it cannot be denied that humans have been negatively affecting the ecosystem for a long time. Thousands of trees have been cut down by us for buildings, skyscrapers, and roads,..., the animals are being hunted to serve human interests, which leads to the extinction of some species. So, it is easy to understand why some people have a negative view of this problem. In fact, Vietnam used to have a large number of tigers but in recent years, there are only very few tigers still alive and most of them are being cared in nature conservation areas. \n On the other hand, it is not impossible to improve this issue. I firmly believe that there are a lot of things governments and individuals are capable of dealing with this. The authorities have taken measures to minimize anthropogenic activities, more and more movements to fight against harmful activities that impact the environment. For example, in Vietnam, due to improved public awareness, the forest cover ratio has increased from 38,7% in 2008 to 42% in 2020. \n In conclusion, this topic causes a lot of arguments but I personally think that we need to be responsibility to protect the only planet we have.","The prompt restatement contains inaccuracies because it comes across as a part of the writer's personal opinion instead of being an interpretation of the original prompt. That is because it makes factual claims that cannot be found / are not contained in the original prompt. It is best to never merge the personal point of view of the author with the restatement because of this problem. It would be better to save any personal insight for the writer's opinion section. \n Punctuation usage is a problem in this presentation. Specifically, the writer's confusion as to how punctuation marks are correctly used. Here is a big hint: Use it one at a time, never successively. That means, you cannot use a comma, ellipses, then a comma again. It does not make sense in the sentence structure and it does not make sense in terms of punctuation usage rules either. This error is an example of a reason why the essay will receive a failing GRA score. \n Instructions indicate that the writer has to compare his personal opinion against the public opinion. It is this back and forth comparison that creates the comprehensive discussion and clear writer's opinion (per point of view). What the writer has presented is a personal opinion focused essay which will limit the scoring potential of the essay. He only covered 1 out of 3 discussion expectations. The essay is not properly developed and will have limited scoring potential because of it.","The essay provided is thoughtful and addresses an important issue: the impact of human activities on flora and fauna, and whether efforts to mitigate these effects are sufficient. However, there are several areas in which the essay could be improved to better meet the requirements of an English proficiency test and more effectively communicate the author's viewpoint.

1. **Clarity and Response to the Topic**: The introduction of the essay blends personal opinion with the interpretation of the prompt. It's important to clearly distinguish between the two. Initially, present the issue at hand in a neutral manner, saving personal insights for later in the essay. This approach will help in accurately framing the discussion before introducing personal perspectives.

2. **Language Use and Punctuation**: The essay displays challenges with punctuation, particularly with the incorrect sequencing of commas and ellipses. Remember, punctuation marks should be used correctly and one at a time. Misuse of punctuation can obscure the meaning of sentences and reduce the clarity of your argument. Focus on understanding and applying punctuation rules to enhance readability.

3. **Structure and Argumentation**: The essay leans heavily towards a personal opinion without adequately contrasting it against public opinion or other viewpoints. For a more balanced and comprehensive discussion, it’s crucial to explore differing perspectives on the issue. This not only demonstrates critical thinking but also enriches your argument. Following the instruction to compare personal and public opinions will strengthen the essay's development and potentially its scoring potential.

4. **Spelling and Grammar**: While the essay does not show significant spelling errors, there are some grammatical issues to address, such as subject-verb agreement (""the government have"" should be ""the government has""). Ensuring grammatical accuracy is vital for clear communication and to avoid misunderstandings.

5. **Developing Arguments**: The examples provided, like the situation with tigers in Vietnam, are good but could be more impactful if they are clearly tied back to the argument. Expanding on how specific measures have led to positive changes, with more detail, could strengthen the case being made.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion reiterates the author's stance but misses an opportunity to succinctly summarize the arguments presented. A stronger closing would reinforce the main points of discussion, briefly remind the reader of the evidence, and make a compelling final statement on the issue.

Improving on these areas will not only make for a better-structured and clearer essay but also demonstrate proficiency in language and argumentation skills. The topic at hand is compelling, and with these adjustments, the essay can convey its important message more effectively.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Deciding on whether kids should start learning a different language at an earlier stage has been a tough pedagogic task for the scholars. This essay holds a supporting stance for the notion that students should learn a foreign language as early as possible due to the fact that it is more flexible and feasible. \n In terms of flexibility, begin learning at primary school allows more room for manoeuver. Teachers can arrange activities like a study tour to a foreign place or communication with a foreign pen friend for the students throughout the six years. Students can have more time to breed their interest for the language. They can get to know more about the language through watching cartoons with foreign subtitles. \n Considering the feasibility, though many would claim that children are not mature enough to learn another language at primary school, the fact is kids at primary school are indeed stress-free and would learn at a faster pace instead. Secondary schoolchildren have to confront countless obstacles in their school life, be it the rigid school curriculum or the tremendous pressure brought by the competitive social phenomenon. Hardly can they spare any time for family reunion, not to mention about learning a different language which requires relentless determination. \n In conclusion, even if primary school children are not physiologically developed enough to learn a new language, the benefits of begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school outweigh the demerits of it in terms of flexibility and feasibility.","Good work.

Though there are existing grammar accuracy problems in your work, these did not deter the reader from reading what you had to say to the very end. Mostly because the mistakes did not confuse the reader nor pose any problems in deciphering the meaning behind your words. This is a very solid accomplishment on your part. I do not doubt that if you continue to write in this manner, you will score no less than a 6 in the actual test.","Your essay provides a clear and structured argument in favor of starting foreign language education at an early stage, specifically in primary school. You have done well to clearly state your position on the topic right from the beginning and to stick to this stance throughout the essay, successfully linking your arguments to the overarching theme. Your conclusion effectively recaps your main points, reinforcing your standpoint convincingly.

However, there are a few areas that would benefit from improvement. Firstly, while your essay maintains relevancy to the topic, enhancing the specificity of your examples and arguments could strengthen your position further. For instance, when discussing the flexibility and feasibility of learning a foreign language in primary school, providing concrete examples or citing studies could make your argument more persuasive.

On the grammatical front, there are some errors present in your essay that slightly disrupt the reading flow. Paying close attention to verb tense consistency and sentence structure could enhance readability. Additionally, consider reviewing the use of phrases and idiomatic expressions to ensure they are applied correctly.

It's also worth noting that while your essay does well to present a coherent point of view, expanding on the potential challenges and how they can be overcome could add depth to your argument. Acknowledging counterarguments and providing a response to them demonstrates critical thinking and a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Despite these advantages, this amenity has its own demerits such as environmental degradation, pollution and dangerous journeys. \n One of the main issues associated with broad highway is the negative impact on environment. Many of these routes, for example, have created after destroying clusters of plant species, thus reducing the green part of the area, which promotes the chance of global warming. Moreover, heavy traffic on motorways creates pollution. This means vehicles emit enormous amount of smoke and probably a great noise, consequently people and nature might suffer with this problem. \n Yet another main problems of motorways is its chances of accidents due to speed of motor vehicles and weather conditions. In these routes, for instance, speed limits likely to be more higher than city or village routes. If they are not maintaining adequate speed or exceeds limits, perhaps will lead to road traffic accidents. Furthermore, climatic conditions often increase accidents by altering visual pathways or covering sign boards (for example: smog). These all are the main demerits of motorways. \n There are some solutions that can be taken to curtail issues in motorways. Firstly, government should plan properly before constructing such pathways and give more consideration to the environment in order to reduce negative impact on it. Secondly, it is always possible to provide awareness campaign to drivers regarding traffic rules and protocols to reduce incidents. Lastly, smoke tests strategies and sound restrictions policies should be implemented to curb the issues of pollution. \n To conclude, thanks to motorway, which helps to save more time in the hectic life of many people: however, its negative consequences should not be forgotten.

The score is based upon the improper paraphrasing of the opening statement, lack of proper paragraph / discussion development, and lack of complex sentence development. Your lexical resource is amateur at best and did not help to increase your score either. Had you properly paraphrased the prompt discussion, your score could have been increased to at least a 6. At this point, your biggest problem in the essay seems to be your inability to properly paraphrase the prompt. That led to a misunderstanding of the prompt requirements and your discussion. Since the paraphrasing is supposed to outline the discussion, in the manner required by the original instruction, you need to practice developing your outline statements. Make sure that you only offer the topic for discussion, the discussion purpose, and the manner of discussion properly in the opening statement before you move on to the body paragraphs. \n In order to increase your score, use only one strong discussion subject per paragraph instead of 2. The way you have your paragraphs set up, you only managed to present the idea instead of properly setting up the discussion in a coherent and cohesive manner. That means that the paragraphs need to clearly show your topic and fully explain its relevance to the discussion. This is how you manage to increase your vocabulary and grammar score. When you try to present more than one idea in a paragraph, the essay suffers because you are not able to properly represent your English grammar / written skills. \n In reference to your paragraphs, make sure that you always have at least 3 sentences in there, regardless of whether it is the paraphrasing, body paragraph, or conclusion. With regards to the conclusion that you have written, you should have properly summarized the effects of the development of motorways within the paragraph.

To further enhance your essay, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The introduction of your essay touches upon the topic, but it could be improved by more accurately paraphrasing the original prompt. This means presenting the topic, the purpose of the discussion, and how you intend to discuss it right from the start. This approach helps in setting a clearer direction for your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, Stylistic Issues:** The essay displays a grasp of language that could be further enriched by honing your ability to construct complex sentences. This involves more than just extending sentences; it means developing them in a way that adds depth to your analysis. Expanding your vocabulary will also aid in articulating your arguments more precisely. Ensure that each paragraph contains at least three sentences to maintain a structured and comprehensive discussion.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** Your stance on the issue is discernible but can be made more explicit through a more thorough paraphrasing of the prompt in your opening. When your introduction clearly outlines your perspective, it sets a strong foundation for the arguments that follow.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay would benefit from a tighter focus in each paragraph. Aim to explore one main idea per paragraph and delve deeply into that idea. This will not only make your argumentation more compelling but will also provide a clearer structure to your essay, making it easier for the reader to follow your train of thought. Each idea should be fully developed to convincingly support your viewpoint.

5. **Improvements in Conclusion:** Your concluding statement endeavours to wrap up your discussion, yet it falls short of effectively summarizing the essay’s key points. A more robust conclusion that succinctly encapsulates the discussion helps to reinforce your arguments and leaves the reader with a lasting impression of your perspective.

By focusing on these areas, you can elevate the quality of your essay, making it a more powerful and persuasive piece of writing.

To start with, people living in Hong Kong have inadequate time for sport playing due to long working or studying hours. Most of the time, long travelling hours are required to arrive their workplaces or schools, and they also need to do some household chores before bedtime. Therefore, the necessity of doing exercises is usually ignored. The second point is laziness. People may not be determined enough to quit unhealthy habits.

Another example is people continue to live with insufficient exercises on the simple grounds that they are not comfortable. \n In order to encourage people to avoid bad habits and increase physical exercise, some solutions are suggested.

Additionally, varying your sentence structure can make your writing more engaging and less repetitive.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view on the importance of addressing lifestyle habits for health is clear. However, the structure of your essay somewhat muddles your arguments. Discussing one problem and one solution per paragraph can help clarify your points. This structure allows you to delve deeper into each issue and solution, providing more substantial support and development for your ideas.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While you mention causes, effects, and solutions, your discussion lacks depth. For each problem you identify, such as busy lifestyles leading to inadequate exercise or the ease of maintaining unhealthy habits, expand on why these are significant issues and how they impact individual health. Similarly, when suggesting solutions like taxing unhealthy products or offering incentives for healthy behaviors, explain how these measures can effectively change behavior. Providing more detailed examples, statistics, or hypothetical outcomes could strengthen your arguments.

While some people argue that it is good, I believe that it has some detrimental impacts. \n On the one hand, there are several reasons why sponsoring sports events is beneficial. Firstly, sports teams or players are received free equipment from the companies. It is true that some people who play sports often face financial burdens when they follow their passion, so the money from business sponsors can help players focus on practicing instead of being distracted by financial worries. Secondly, sports sponsorship provides increased media exposure and turnover for a company. Marketing campaigns in a sporting event can attract numerous potential customers for brands sponsors because sports fans tend to be interested in using their products. For instance, Coca-Cola, a famous business always donates for the FIFA World Cup tournament, is successful to make profits from stadium advertising and mass media. \n On the other hand, I believe that advertising from sponsor sports is more severe because of the following reason. The main disadvantage is the risk of investing in athletes or sports teams. It is difficult to anticipate the results in sport because anything can happen. If the player is unsuccessful, it might affect products sales of the sponsoring business. The other drawback is some companies advertise products harmful to health such as tobacco or alcohol drinks. When young people are exposed to these advertisements and using those products, their health might be harmful. It goes against the main purpose of sport which is to improve human fitness. \n In conclusion, I firmly believe that donating for sport to advertising has some adverse effects although it has some positive impacts.","The prompt restatement is incomplete as it does not offer a glimpse into the 2 public points of view prior to the personal opinion.

However, the introduction could be strengthened by presenting the two common public viewpoints on the matter before sharing your own opinion. This allows for a clearer understanding of the debate at hand and sets a solid foundation for your arguments.

In terms of structure, your essay would benefit from a more systematic approach to presenting your views and the reasoning behind them. Ideally, each paragraph should begin by highlighting a public opinion, followed by the reasoning behind this viewpoint, and then transition into your personal opinion with an explanation to support it. An example that illustrates your point can also be added to strengthen your argument. This format would help maximize the clarity and impact of your essay, ensuring that each part flows logically into the next and fully addresses the prompt.

While you've made good points about the advantages and disadvantages of sports sponsorships, it’s crucial to maintain a clear and consistent presentation throughout your essay. Ensure that your discussion aligns with the original prompt without altering its meaning or introducing new claims that were not present.

On the topic of language use, it's important to watch out for spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could distract from your message. For instance, phrases like ""is successful to make"" could be revised to ""successfully makes"" for clarity and conciseness. Additionally, be mindful of using specific examples to back up your claims, as this adds credibility to your arguments. 

Regarding the point of view, while your personal stance on the issue is evident, integrating it with the broader public opinions more seamlessly would enhance your essay. This ensures readers understand not only your perspective but also how it fits within the wider conversation on sports sponsorships.

Finally, it's beneficial to conclude your essay by succinctly summarizing your key points and restating your stance, reinforcing the argument you have presented. This leaves the reader with a clear understanding of your position on the matter.

This essay is going to compare blockbusters of the biggest film industry - Hollywood and those of Vietnam - a small country in the world. \n A significant difference is quality. Firstly, Hollywood has far more blockbusters than Vietnamese ones. People these days are likely to enjoy some categories like fictional, violent and action movies, which are well-developed by Hollywood. To illustrate, Marvel series films about superheroes are on top of the world in terms of the rating. Hollywood blockbusters not only include so many gripping plots, but the cinematic effect is also professional and lively as well. That is the reason why they are watched so widely. On the other hand, movies in Vietnam are often series of romantic or psychological dramas about real life. Moreover, it seems Vietnamese cinematic technology is not skillful enough to make attractive scenes. Consequently, they are hardly influential to many people. \n The next difference is actors. The actors in Hollywood blockbusters are selected carefully from various countries. They tend to be experienced so that they can be flexible in expressing emotions and handle every scene. In addition, they have already had a certain number of fans all over the world. As a result, those actors play an important part in making a film into a blockbuster. In contrast, there are rarely foreigners in blockbusters of Vietnam. Almost the cast are Vietnamese who are not well-known, thus they cannot attract many people worldwide. That is one of the reasons why there are few Vietnamese blockbusters although some films are so excellent. \n Besides the contrasts, they also have their similarities. Each of them are built with the director's enthusiasm and much assistance from the others. Their works contain meanings and lessons of life in order that the viewers can understand and learn from them. \n In conclusion, these two kinds of blockbusters have both differences and similarities. There are rather many aspects that Hollywood blockbusters outweigh Vietnamese ones such as the quality and the actors. However, the meaningful lessons of all these works delivered to us are the same.","The original topic basis is not clearly interpreted in the first paragraph.The writer opens with an opinion about cinematography, then goes on to discuss a totally different focus.

The introduction starts by praising blockbusters but then shifts to comparing the film industries of Hollywood and Vietnam without a clear transition or thesis statement. It's vital to explicitly state the essay's topic and position in the opening paragraph to guide readers.

Regarding content, the essay does a reasonable job of highlighting differences between Hollywood and Vietnamese cinema in terms of quality, special effects, and actor selection. However, while mentioning similarities towards the end, these are not explored in detail as the differences are. To strengthen the essay, dedicate a specific section to discuss similarities in-depth, creating a more balanced comparison.

There are noticeable grammar issues and areas where sentence structure could be improved for clarity. For example, simplifying complex sentences and ensuring subject-verb agreement can make the essay easier to understand.

The point of view is generally clear, indicating a preference for Hollywood blockbusters due to their higher quality, technology, and international cast. Yet, this viewpoint could be articulated more persuasively with specific examples and a more structured argument.

While the conclusion attempts to summarize the essay's main points, it suggests that differences and similarities were equally discussed, which is not the case. Ensure that the conclusion accurately reflects the essay's content, summarizing both discussed aspects proportionately.

To enhance this essay, consider the following steps:
- Start with a clear introduction that presents the comparison topic and your thesis statement.
- Use separate paragraphs to discuss differences and similarities, ensuring each point is well-supported with examples.
- Work on sentence structure for better clarity and flow.
- Revise the conclusion to accurately represent the essay's content.
- Address grammatical and stylistic issues for a polished final version.

Implementing these suggestions can significantly improve the essay's effectiveness and coherence, making your analysis and comparison of Hollywood and Vietnamese blockbusters more compelling to the reader.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Analytical

To some extent, I agree that advertising has a massive impact on sales, but I would also argue that we do need most of the products that we buy. \n On the one hand, the influence of advertisements on customers is so powerful that they might sometimes buy unnecessary goods and services. It is clear that advertisers use special effects and artistic images that draw people's attention; these people are convinced that the products are either of perfectly good quality and deserve their payment or very essential for their life. A mobile phone could be a good example of these buying habits. Every year people could be seen queuing for miles in front of Apple stores to buy the latest models, even when their current phones remain in good use and do not need replacing. This situation could, therefore, prove the fact that advertising has done its effects on customers. \n On the other hand, I believe that most people have made buying decisions to meet their demands, not only because of advertisements. There are always certain needs for people to improve their quality of life. These individuals, in order to satisfy their wishes, tend to actively come to see the adverts that can lead them to an insight into the products. Advertisement does not, as a consequence, manipulate customers; by contrast, it does help them to make the ultimate choices. In the past, it could be hard for people to buy goods and services due to the lack of information stemming from advertisements. \n In conclusion, it is undeniable that advertising industry has substantially affected users' behaviors, but I believe people would make wise choices on their demands.","You have changed the discussion format of the essay. How did you do that? \n Original topic: high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. \n Your Topic: companies have been increasingly approaching a more considerable amount of customers than in the past, thanks to the advertisement. \n Original Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree? \n Discussion Response: To some extent, I agree that advertising has a massive impact on sales, but I would also argue that we do need most of the products that we buy. \n As you can see, your discussion topic and response to the question are inaccurate when compared to the original. Therefore, this essay will be considered to be non-responsive to the task provided.","The essay presents a thoughtful discussion on the impact of advertising on consumer behavior and the nature of purchasing decisions. However, there are key areas which require attention to enhance the clarity, relevance, and effectiveness of the argument. Below are some points that will help improve the essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The original prompt asked for an evaluation of whether high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising or the actual needs of society. The essay seems to slightly shift this focus to a more general discussion on the impact of advertising on customer reach and purchasing decisions. To improve, ensure that the response directly addresses whether you agree or disagree with the original statement, focusing specifically on the connection between advertising, consumer needs, and high sales of popular goods.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written, but it could benefit from closer attention to sentence structure for clearer expression. For instance, consider simplifying complex sentences to make the argument more accessible to the reader. Also, watch for consistency in tense and voice to maintain a smooth flow.

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:** The essay does well in presenting a balanced view, acknowledging the significant influence of advertising while also recognizing that consumer choices are not solely determined by advertisements. This dual perspective is good, but making a stronger, clearer stance in the opening paragraphs would help the reader understand the author's primary position from the start.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The essay provides descriptive examples, such as the annual queues for the latest mobile phone models, which effectively illustrate how advertising influences consumer behavior. To strengthen the argument, further analysis of why and how certain advertisements encourage purchases that might not be necessary could be beneficial. Moreover, including more detailed evidence or studies could support the claim that consumers also make decisions based on genuine needs.

To enhance your essay, consider the following suggestions:
- Start by clearly stating your position in relation to the prompt, ensuring your discussion aligns directly with the question asked.
- Simplify sentence structures where possible for clarity.
- Maintain consistent tense and perspective throughout the essay.
- Expand your arguments with more detailed evidence or examples, particularly when discussing the real needs versus the influence of advertising.

Remember, a strong essay responds directly to the question asked, is clear and coherent in its argumentation, and uses evidence effectively to support its points.",4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

I assume that this trend happens more in the cases of ancient houses and areas that have a history. Firstly this essay will discuss what motivates people to make research, and secondly, how information can be figured out. \n There are several reasons that encourage people to do research. Some people take it serious to know the past of the place where they live because they will feel more connected to it. The story behind a house or a building can make people living in it feel proud, therefore using it to boast in a random conversation with friends. Finding facts about something also provide a chance to learn new things. For example, architect enthusiasts can study the house's ancient architectural style and the construction techniques that keep it standing through decades, or even centuries. \n Looking for information about the past of a certain construction is not as difficult as we may think. Data can be found in existing researches and related newspaper articles. The Internet now enables us to easily access such information with just a click at home without having to immerse ourselves in books and materials at libraries. Talking with the neighborhood can also be an effective way. The neighbors that have been living in the area for a long time can be the most lively books and may tell stories that cannot be found anywhere else. \n In conclusion, researching the history behind a resident site can be amused to many individuals and the facts are approachable in different ways.","Do not make assumptions in the presentation as this indicates the writer is not confident of his opinion. The task 2 essay is an analytical opinion statement and must be stated with confidence in the facts provided. There are no right or wrong answers so there need not be an ""on the fence"" response. By the way, the essay requires discussion outlines, not repeated instructions. State the topic responses directly, without a discussion. \n The response paragraphs are clearly presented with proper samples. More transition words /sentence usage would have added scoring substance though. The writer needs to develop a better summary conclusion over 2-5 sentences for proper scoring application.","This essay tackles the interesting topic of why people in certain nations are increasingly fascinated with the histories and facts related to their homes or buildings, which is a relevant and engaging subject. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make the argument stronger and the essay more compelling.

First, the opening of the essay suggests a hesitance or lack of confidence in presenting the main argument. It's important to assert opinions with confidence, especially in analytical essays. Instead of suggesting, ""I assume,"" it is more powerful to directly state the reasons why this trend is happening. Remember, in essays that ask for your opinion or analysis, there are no wrong answers as long as you can support your views with logical reasoning and evidence.

The body paragraphs well illustrate the reasons people research their homes' past and how they find this information. The examples provided, such as the pride of living in a place with a story or the interest of architectural enthusiasts in construction techniques, are clear and support the essay's main points effectively. However, incorporating transition words or phrases could greatly enhance the flow of ideas from one point to the next. Such connectors help guide the reader through your argument and can make your reasoning easier to follow.

Regarding the conclusion, while it effectively restates the main idea that researching a residence's history can be engaging and informative, it lacks depth. A stronger conclusion would not only summarize the main points discussed but also reflect on their broader importance or suggest implications. Expanding the conclusion to a few more sentences could provide a more satisfying closure to the essay.

Additionally, there are a few minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues to address. For instance, ""amused"" in the conclusion seems to be a misuse, perhaps intended to be ""amusing"" or ""engaging."" Keeping an eye on such details can significantly improve the overall quality of the essay.

Overall, this essay does a commendable job of exploring an intriguing topic. By asserting opinions more confidently, enhancing the flow between points, and expanding the conclusion, the essay could become more persuasive and impactful.

The writer does not adequately convince the leader that he was wronged during the first test and, that he was too affected by Covid when he took the second test. An admission of fault to some degree on the student's part would have helped show repentance and a desire to correct his faults while overcoming obstacles. It would have shown that Covid was the unknown factor that prevented his success.","This essay attempts to convey a narrative of struggle and resilience in the face of academic and health challenges. However, to enhance its efficacy and meet the expectations of an academic assessment or a writing exercise, several aspects require attention and improvement.

Firstly, it's essential to ensure the essay directly addresses the topic at hand. In this case, it's unclear whether the goal is to articulate an academic appeal or to demonstrate English writing skills through personal experience. A clearer focus or introduction stating the purpose of the essay would be beneficial.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay contains several errors that disrupt the flow and clarity of the narrative. For example, commas are often used where periods or semicolons would be more appropriate, leading to run-on sentences. Additionally, there are instances of incorrect word choice (""week"" should be ""weak"", ""concider"" should be ""consider"") and spacing issues around punctuation marks. Improving these aspects through careful proofreading or the use of grammar checking tools will greatly enhance the readability of the essay.

The point of view of the author is somewhat clear, as it's evident the narrative is a personal account of overcoming adversity. However, the conveyance of this perspective could be strengthened by offering more in-depth reflections on the experiences and emotions encountered. This depth would help readers empathize with the author's situation.

While the essay attempts to outline arguments supporting the author's position—namely, the challenge faced due to an initial unsatisfactory grade and the subsequent impact of COVID-19—these arguments lack detail and persuasiveness. Providing more context and evidence regarding why the initial grade was considered unjust or how COVID-19 specifically hindered the author's performance could bolster the narrative. Moreover, acknowledging any shortcomings or areas for improvement in the author's approach to the initial exam might add a nuanced layer to the story, illustrating personal growth and a genuine effort to overcome obstacles beyond mere misfortune.

To improve, focus on:
1. Clearly stating the essay's intent in the introduction.
2. Addressing grammatical and stylistic issues through thorough proofreading.
3. Deepening the narrative by offering more detailed reflections and evidence.
4. Incorporating a balanced perspective that acknowledges personal growth and the complex challenges faced.

By addressing these points, the essay can evolve into a more compelling and effective piece of writing that resonates with readers and meets academic expectations.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,1,Narrative

However, to enhance the essay and meet the English proficiency test standards, several areas require attention and improvement.

1. **Word Count and Depth of Content**: The essay is currently under the minimum word requirement of 250 words. Expanding the essay to meet or exceed this word count is crucial. Doing so will not only avoid penalties but also provide an opportunity to enrich the essay with more detailed examples, explanations, and solutions to air pollution. Consider diving deeper into each point made, perhaps by adding statistics, global examples, or more personal insights on how air pollution affects daily life and the environment.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are grammar and punctuation issues that detract from the clarity and professionalism of the essay. For instance, remember that a comma should not be followed by other punctuation marks like ellipses (...). Each punctuation mark should be used correctly and individually. Proper sentence structure and punctuation are essential for your essay to be taken seriously and to clearly convey your message. Consider reviewing the rules on punctuation usage and sentence structure.

3. **Clarity and Cohesiveness**: While the essay does outline the problems associated with air pollution and suggests solutions, improving the organization and flow will make the argument stronger and more persuasive. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea, supported by facts or examples. Transitions between paragraphs should be smooth, guiding the reader from one idea to the next without confusion. This will also help in clarifying the author's point of view, making it more impactful.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: The point of view is noted - air pollution is a serious issue that needs addressing. However, the supporting arguments can be fortified with more detailed explanations, evidence, and examples. For instance, when discussing the health impacts of air pollution, including specific studies or statistics could make the argument more convincing. Similarly, when suggesting solutions, explaining how these measures could effectively reduce air pollution would strengthen the essay.

To summarize, to improve this essay and excel on the test, it's recommended to expand the content to meet the word requirement, enhancing the argument with more detailed information and examples. Pay close attention to grammar and punctuation to ensure clarity. And finally, work on structuring the essay in a way that each part builds upon the last, leading to a cohesive, compelling argument.

Many subjects can not meet the needs of the future jobs. I completely agree with the statement that school too much concentrate on traditional subjects which affect students in the modern working. \n To begin with, schools must be more flexible in the education because every student will choose and follow the different ways. So they need a different knowledge's source. For example: the technology development is becoming a vital part in modern society which demand a number of the skilled workforce. As the result, if students proficient in using computer or machine, they will achieve success in their career. Therefore, teaching too much traditional subjects for everyone is not a good method. \n In addition, the traditional subjects always learn a lot of theories than skills. That is the reason why many students feel boring when studying them, such as: history, literature or geography. But people can ignore them because all the subjects concern about culture and the society's problems. So the education systerm should be enhanced. Instead of researching lessons in class or books, we need to hold the meeting or game shows to exchange knowledge and skills between students. Moreover, schools have to add some soft skill subjects. Because the world is integrating and need to the people who flexibly adapt the difficult circumstances. \n In conclusion, the traditional subjects are still being concentrated too much.

Even without the prompt, I can see that there are a number of problems with this essay. \n You need to clarify which point of the educational stages (elementary, high school, college) is the focal point of the discussion. Do you believe that the traditional classes that are taught in college during the first 2 years, do not adequately prepare the student for his major classes in the third and final year of college? Or do you mean that all the schools should deviate from the traditional classes in favor of STEM high school studies in order to prepare them for college and the workplace? There needs to be more information attached to your essay that will show how familiar you are with the topic indicated. Your discussion is acceptable but weak. It needs to be strengthened in approach.","The essay raises an important issue about the relevance of traditional subjects in modern education systems compared to the ever-growing importance of modern subjects, which are thought to be more aligned with future job market demands. However, there are several areas within the essay that could benefit from improvement to make your argument more compelling and clear.

Firstly, it would help to specify which educational stages you are focusing on. The discussion could significantly differ depending on whether you are referring to elementary, high school, or college education. Clarifying this will strengthen your argument by providing a clearer context for your points.

It is evident that the essay intends to argue that schools overly focus on traditional subjects to the detriment of students' preparation for the modern workforce. However, the essay would benefit from a more precise response to this issue. It's crucial to be explicit about how the dominance of traditional subjects affects students and which modern subjects should be incorporated into the curriculum for a more balanced education.

The essay contains several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that can potentially distract from the message. For example, “systerm” should be corrected to “system,” and “concider” to “consider.” Additionally, phrases like “too much concentrate” could be refined to “concentrate too much on.” Paying attention to these details will improve the readability of the essay.

The point of view is somewhat clear, but it could be further emphasized by providing specific examples and arguments to support your stance. For instance, mentioning particular modern subjects or skills that schools currently overlook and how their inclusion could benefit students’ future careers would make your argument more persuasive.

Your suggestion to incorporate more interactive and skill-based learning experiences, like meetings or game shows, is intriguing and presents a creative approach to education. However, expanding on how these methods could effectively replace or supplement traditional teaching methods would provide a stronger argument for your position.

In terms of style, the essay would benefit from shorter sentences and clearer wording to make it more accessible to readers, especially considering the intended audience. This simplification can help convey your points more directly and effectively.

In conclusion, your essay touches on significant issues within the education system and suggests the need for a shift towards including more modern subjects and teaching methods. By providing more specific examples, clarifying your stance on which educational stages you are discussing, refining grammar and spelling, and simplifying the language, your essay could present a much stronger case for the changes you are advocating.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

In my view, I believe this trend has more negatives than positives on society. \n To begin with, children on late marriages will be detrimental to the education of society. According to Biodemography and Social Biology Magazine, babies born to mothers in their 20s, more likely to be smarter, score higher on brain tests and do will than their peers born by mothers of their age 30 or 40 born. Those children cannot catch up with their friends, so this creates a distance in the same generation. Moreover, Children have to take care of themselves because their parents get old quickly. Therefore, those teenagers are not equipped with enough skills to become leaders. \n In addition, the benefits of getting married late only belong to people who choose it not to the whole society. Those people have a long time to work, however, they spend their salaries to enjoy what they like. Unmarried people claim that they cannot bring back the youth so that they have to live to the fullest and are not ready for a serious relationship. As a consequence, this trend creates the population imbalance causing a shortage of labor resources. \n All in all, although getting married at 30 ages has some benefits, I still believe that it has more negatives. We should be married at the age when we still healthy to bring a better life for children and also benefit for the future of a country.","Your second paragraph is a little bit more applicable to the prompt instructions when compared to your first reasoning paragraph. The reasoning in relation to children is not based on personal experience, knowledge, or observations. You are citing 2 different information sources for your reasoning support, which goes against the instructions for the topic discussion. You will lose points for improper discussion formatting since you are using cited and unverified information in your first discussion paragraph. Then, in your second reasoning paragraph, your line of thought is not very clear. \n You need to remember, reasoning paragraph 1 must directly connect to the discussion in reasoning paragraph 2.

Here are some specific areas to work on:

1. **Relevance to Topic**: The essay tackles the assigned topic by discussing the implications of marrying and having children later in life. This is a positive aspect as it shows an understanding of the question posed. To strengthen this aspect, ensure every argument directly relates to how this trend impacts society, not just individuals.

2. **Use of Evidence**: The essay attempts to support arguments with evidence, seen when discussing children’s development in relation to their parents’ age. However, the prompt requires reasoning based on personal experience, knowledge, or observations rather than cited sources. To improve, focus on personal insights or widely observed societal trends that don’t need specific external citations.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: The essay's flow between paragraphs can be enhanced. The transition from discussing the impact on children to societal effects of late marriages is abrupt. Introduce smoother transitions to connect these ideas, ensuring that each paragraph builds upon the last. This will improve the overall coherence and make your argument stronger and easier to follow.

4. **Simplicity of Language**: The advice to stick to shorter, simpler sentences is crucial. Long, complex sentences can often become confusing, especially if English is not your first language. Aim for clarity and precision in your writing. For instance, instead of saying ""children on late marriages will be detrimental to the education of society,"" consider saying ""children from older parents may face educational challenges.""

5. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues**: There are spelling and grammar errors that need attention. For example, ""do will than their peers"" should be corrected to ""do well than their peers,"" and the term ""30 ages"" should be revised to ""the age of 30"". Paying close attention to verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and the correct use of articles will also enhance your essay's readability.

6. **Presentation of Viewpoint**: While your stance on the issue is clear, reinforcing it with more balanced reasoning would strengthen your argument. Discuss the positives and negatives equally before concluding your perspective. This balanced approach ensures a comprehensive view of the subject matter.

Remember, the strength of an essay comes from clear, coherent arguments backed by logical reasoning or personal observation.

From my standpoint, I am in of tune with the former stand, and in this essay, I will discuss further my verdict. \n It is fathomable that moving on to a new appointment is not a favorable choice for many people. Standing behind this is the fact that it can affect the financial stability of a person. As a striking illustration, in Asian countries such as China or Vietnam, high school students are deliberately guided to choose their most fitting occupation, which constitutes perpetual, in vocational courses organized by the school. It is due to the belief that the time spent on finding a new job may be extended which can cause acute effects on the finance of an individual. Additionally, the lack of confidence to find a new, suitable job is also a plausible reason. Because of social prejudice toward people who are jobless, many individuals are disheartened to quit their current occupations. Thus, it is common sense that there are many adherents to the latter view. \n Nonetheless, on the other hand, proponents of the first view also have numerous rational reasons to fortify their opinion. One justification usually brought up is the fulfillment of working in the right place. There are many things that cause people to quit, and one of these is the detrimental working environment, such as negative coworkers, and boss, which can result in the apprehension and depression of an employee. Moreover, being employed in a more suitable position can create enthusiasm fostering people to work assiduously and persistently, which is not only beneficial to the workers themselves but also to the company or the business they are working for.

Let's dive into these areas with a focus on adhering more closely to the essay prompt, addressing issues related to grammar and style, clarifying your point of view, and ensuring your arguments are well-supported and descriptive.

1. **Response to the Essay Topic:**
   It seems there may have been some deviation from the original prompt. It's vital to restate the topic directly and accurately in your introduction without adding new information that could change the original discussion points. Beginning your essay by laying out your discussion or opinion in the first paragraph should be avoided. Instead, clearly restate the prompt, and save your reasoning and detailed discussion for the body paragraphs. This approach will help keep your essay focused and aligned with the given topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   The essay demonstrates a good command of language but could benefit from a closer review of grammar and stylistic choices. For example, the phrase ""I am in of tune with the former stand"" could be more clearly expressed as ""I agree with the former viewpoint"". Be mindful of complex sentences that may benefit from simplification for greater clarity. This will not only make your essay easier to understand but also help in conveying your arguments more effectively.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
   Your point of view is present but could be articulated more clearly. Early in the essay, directly state your stance on the issue to guide the reader through your following arguments. This clarity upfront helps in maintaining a coherent flow and ensuring that your perspective is understood from the beginning.

4. **Supporting Arguments:**
   Your essay contains persuasive arguments on both sides of the debate, which is commendable. However, your points can be strengthened by providing more specific examples and clearer connections between your claims and the evidence or reasoning backing them up. Ensure each paragraph focuses on a single main idea, and use transitions to link your ideas smoothly. This will help your essay to be more persuasive and logically structured.

By making these improvements, you'll enhance the coherence, clarity, and persuasiveness of your essay. Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep writing, and use these tips as a guide to refine your approach to essay writing.",4,4,4,2,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative
4238,https://essayforum.com/writing/cultural-traditions-destroyed-turning-91315/,test,Writing Task 2: Whether cultural traditions are destroyed by turning them into tourist attractions?,"For thousands of years, cultural traditions have been preserved from the time of founding and defending the country until our developing era. However, conservation of these traditions is controversial whether it is true when using national cultural traditions as a money-making tourist attraction. Some people hold the opinion that it is unethical and this destroys Vietnamese traditions while others believe traditions can be saved by doing this. Both views will be discussed and my perspective will be proposed later. \n With the aim of making money by turning traditions into famous destinations, some people disapprove because it can damage these Vietnamese cultural traditions. As soon as it becomes a famous tourist attraction, a huge number of tourists can pay a visit to these places and it can be a disaster if there are many people lacking awareness who throw their rubbish everywhere they go. As a result, the destination will not retain its beauty as the first time people can see as well as its original sanctity. \n However, it is more convincing to believe that this development is the only method to conserve these traditions. Firstly, making Vietnamese cultures commercial could be the ideal way to deliver those to the community so that people can enhance their awareness and knowledge about the long-lasting history of Vietnam. Cultural traditions will be passed down from the older generation to the younger generation, that is the full meaning of conservation. Furthermore, this can help cultures of Vietnam to be acknowledged by different countries in the world, which increase the rank of Vietnam in the global tourism map. \n In conclusion, although there is still little struggle in the ways of cultural tradition conservation, turning them into tourist attractions can be the best way to preserve Vietnamese cultures and pass down to the younger generation.","<quotation>Vietnamese</quotation> \n Why did you center on vietnam? That is not the focus of the essay. The discussion focus has changed. This inaccuracy will result in a scoring deduction. \n <quotation>my perspective will be proposed</quotation> \n Give your opinion at once since you are implying the 5 paragraph discussion forumat rather than the 4 paragraph, per public . consideration (a personal opinion for each reason). \n <quotation>Vietnamese cultural traditions</quotation> \n Another incorrect topic reference, another deduction applied.

General discussions should use reasons applicable to any country. You may use your country as a stated example but, it should not be the discussion target.","Your essay on the conservation of cultural traditions through tourism presents a relevant and significant topic. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to better adhere to the essay requirements and enhance clarity, coherence, and accuracy. Here is a breakdown of the feedback based on the outlined aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic**:
   - The focus on Vietnam as the primary example shifts the essay away from a more general discussion intended by the prompt. While using specific examples from a particular country can be helpful, the essay should maintain a broad perspective applicable to various cultural contexts. To improve, next time, try to broaden your discussion to include examples or reasons that could apply to any country, only using specific ones like Vietnam to support your general points.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**:
   - Your essay is generally well-written with a few minor issues. However, it could benefit from a clearer introduction of your personal perspective. Instead of stating, ""my perspective will be proposed later,"" consider integrating your viewpoint earlier and more definitively into the essay. This approach helps to guide the reader through your argumentation more smoothly.

3. **Point of View Clarity**:
   - Your point of view becomes clear by the conclusion, but it could be presented more prominently throughout the essay. Providing your opinion alongside the discussion of each viewpoint would strengthen the coherence of the essay and make your position more transparent to the reader.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**:
   - You've presented two sides of the argument, which is a good structure. However, the arguments could be enhanced by providing more specific examples, evidence, or analysis to support your claims. For instance, when discussing the potential damage caused by tourists, citing specific instances or studies would make your argument more persuasive. Similarly, when arguing for the commercialization of culture as a conservation method, offering concrete examples or data to back up the benefits would strengthen your case.
   
Overall, your essay tackles an important topic and demonstrates good structure and an understanding of the issue. To elevate your writing, ensure that your discussion remains relevant to the prompt, clearly state and consistently maintain your perspective, and support your arguments with specific, detailed evidence. Also, remember to keep your discussion general unless using specific countries as illustrative examples. This approach will improve the coherence, relevance, and persuasiveness of your essays.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

You have to improve your English skills overall, with a focus on quality rather than quantity writing.","Your essay addresses an important topic: the impact of smartphones on society and the balance between their benefits and drawbacks. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to make your essay more effective and aligned with English proficiency standards. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects to consider:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay does respond to the topic by discussing both the negative and positive aspects of smartphone usage. However, the arguments are not fully developed and seem to contradict at times. For example, you initially argue that using phones is illegal due to distractions and lack of interaction, but later you mention their benefits in emergencies and learning. Clarifying your stance and presenting a more balanced view could strengthen your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay has numerous spelling and grammar errors that could significantly distract readers and impact your score. For example:
   - Spelling mistakes like ""concider"" should be ""consider,"" ""beneficial"" not ""benficial,"" and ""interaction"" not ""iteraction.""
   - Grammar errors, such as using ""is illegal"" instead of ""should be restricted"" or ""can be disruptive.""
   - Sentence structure needs improvement for clarity, and punctuation errors (like missing commas) disrupt the flow.
   
   Focusing on shorter, clearer sentences can help avoid these issues and make your essay easier to understand.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: While you do state your opinion, the mixed messages throughout the essay make your overall point of view unclear. Start by clearly stating your thesis in the introduction and consistently support it with well-reasoned arguments and examples in the body paragraphs.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: Your arguments fluctuate between the drawbacks and advantages of smartphones without a clear connection or transition. Improve your essay by:
   - Clearly categorizing the negative and positive points into separate paragraphs.
   - Using examples that directly support your main point. The anecdote about using TikTok, for instance, is a good start but needs to be directly tied to how it supports your argument.
   - Introducing counterarguments and then explaining why the benefits might outweigh the negatives, or vice versa, to add depth to your discussion.

Remember, focusing on the quality of your writing—coherent arguments, correct grammar, and clear structure—will have a more positive impact on your score than merely aiming for a higher word count. Take time to plan your essay, draft clear sentences, and revise your work for any errors or unclear arguments before submission. This approach will help you craft a more compelling and proficient essay.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

There was a huge fire that destroyed most important parts of tropical forests. Until now, we haven't found out what exactly caused this disaster. But it feel like that we, as human beings, partly need to have responsibility for what happened to the nature. \n Firstly, we need to mention the influence of our daily-life activities on the nature of our Earth. A tremendous increase in our production leads to the larger amount of C02 released into our atmosphere, therefore, makes an increase in temperature of our Earth with a significant amount. As a result of that, the quantity of rain day after day will be decreased so much that just only one candle also can get rid of the whole forest in some hours. \n Secondly, we don't have any consistent attitude towards protecting and revitalizing our forest after excessive usage. How we can do that ??? \n We need to organize much more campaigns that encourage everyone from all over the world to take part in growing trees on our lands. Maybe we cannot see the effects immediately. But our planet will make use of our trees for reducing CO2 and due to that, our planet can be cooler. \n In summary, forests are like our second houses, so if we care about our life, we also need focus on their health. If not, we can kill ourselves in future.","If you are discussing only 2 topics in the body paragraphs, there is no need to numerically list it. Instead, use topic sentences at the start of the paragraph. That creates a more fluid presentation and avoids the feeling of choppiness while going from paragraph to paragraph. Use transition sentences towards the end of the first paragraph to create a flowing discussion presentation into the next topic. Avoid run-on sentences. Learn when to use a period instead of a comma. The term ""therefore"" is often used to start a sentence. It not usually used in the middle of the sentence. When writing formal papers, use only 1 punctuation mark, never 3 or more. You are not writing for a comic strip.","Your essay addresses a significant and timely topic: the impact of human activities on natural disasters, focusing on the Australian forest fires. It's commendable how you've chosen a subject that draws attention to environmental concerns. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

1. **Responsiveness to Topic**: You've effectively selected a relevant topic and linked human activities to environmental degradation. However, expanding on specific examples or evidence demonstrating this relationship would strengthen your argument. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few issues to address in terms of grammar and spelling. It's crucial to pay attention to the correct spelling of words (e.g., ""C02"" should be ""CO2"", and ""concider"" should be ""consider""). Additionally, try to avoid using multiple question marks (""???"") or run-on sentences. These changes can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your standpoint on human responsibility for natural disasters is clear. To further enhance this, ensure that every argument you make directly supports your viewpoint. This direct support makes your position more compelling.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You've begun to outline arguments about human impact on the environment and the need for tree planting campaigns. These are good starts! To improve, introduce specific examples or data that highlight the severity of your concerns. This evidence can make your argument more convincing. Also, consider using topic sentences to start each paragraph, guiding the reader through your arguments without abrupt transitions. Avoid listing your points (""Firstly,"" ""Secondly,"") in a way that makes your essay feel choppy or disconnected.

Moreover, incorporating transition sentences between paragraphs can help your essay flow more smoothly, guiding the reader naturally from one point to the next. Avoid using ""therefore"" in the middle of sentences where it might interrupt the natural flow; instead, use it at the beginning of sentences to draw conclusions or indicate results.

Lastly, focusing on sentence structure can improve clarity and reduce confusion. Learn to identify when a period is needed instead of a comma. This will help in avoiding run-on sentences that can make your essay difficult to follow.

In summary, you've tackled an important subject with potential for a strong argument. With refinement in structure, more substantial evidence, and attention to grammar and style, your essay could be greatly improved. Keep focusing on making your arguments clear and supported by examples, and pay attention to the fluidity of your writing to engage your readers more effectively.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

This means that it is not that important to travel to other countries. To what extent do you agree of disagree with this opinion?,"In recent decades, many people have started to learn a new culture from the Internet rather than through traveling. Although some traditional learners would oppose this studying method, the use of the Internet has brought various benefits for cultural learners. \n There are a number of reasons why studying culture online could benefit learners. First, since the performance of the Internet connection has been improved, this had led to the popularity in digital education. In fact, online courses could supply learners all source of knowledge from the basics to the advances, with a reasonable joining fee. Second, it is true that with the help of the Internet, global citizens have a great opportunity to get in touch together. Social media, for instance, is considered as a place for exploring other country's cultures since users can have a chance to communicate with foreigners, which can gain valuable information about it. \n Another reason that encourages people to move to online learning is because of the price and time. Compared to the traditional way, studying on the Internet seems to be less costly for individuals since the cost of electronic devices is affordable. Therefore, while traveling to experience a new culture is only suitable for a person who is financially in life, but a computer could provide learning opportunities for most people. Moreover, it is more flexible for learners to plan for their studying. If it is not for the Internet, learning for other cultures would be impossible for full-time workers since their timetable is limited. \n In conclusion, thanks to the innovation of the Internet, people have a sufficient way to study culture.

However, there are several ways in which this essay could be improved to make the arguments more effective and to better meet the requirements of an English proficiency test.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It's essential that the essay directly address the question posed by the prompt. The essay seems to create its own prompt rather than responding directly to whether the author agrees or disagrees with the opinion stated. To improve, ensure that the thesis statement at the end of the introduction clearly responds to the specific question being asked, expressing whether you agree or disagree with the given opinion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay generally uses correct spelling and grammar, which is good. However, there are a few areas where sentences could be more clear or concise. For example, ""since the performance of the Internet connection has been improved, this had led to the popularity in digital education."" could be simplified to ""Improved Internet performance has led to the popularity of digital education."" Also, watch for the correct use of articles (""a"", ""the"", ""an"") and ensure verb tenses are consistent. 

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view is somewhat clear, as you argue that the Internet has benefits for cultural learners. However, because the essay doesn't directly respond to the prompt's question of agreeing or disagreeing with a specific opinion, your stance isn't as clear as it could be. Make sure your position is explicitly stated in the introduction and reinforced in the conclusion.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** Your essay provides several reasons why studying culture online is beneficial, such as cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and the range of materials available. These are strong points, but the essay could be improved by more directly connecting these points to the cultural learning process rather than the academic side of online learning. Providing specific examples or personal experiences would also strengthen your arguments by giving readers concrete illustrations of your points.

Improving these areas will make your essay stronger, clearer, and more directly responsive to the essay prompt. Remember, understanding and responding to the exact prompt is crucial for doing well on English proficiency tests.",4,4,3,2,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Firstly, how technology is making it easy to access information and secondly, how automation is affecting people of lower stature. \n Since its advent, technology has become more accessible by a large majority of the human population making the attainment of information easier than ever before. For a lot of individuals, this has created opportunities to think outside of the box or helped them find their own niche in our urban society, creating a positive feedback loop which in turn helps us reach greater heights of development. This evolution has further helped us attain better living conditions and better economic conditions. \n Despite the positive impacts of technology, automation has served to be a boon for people of the worse end of the economic spectrum. As technology advances, many of the unskilled work done by laborers have been automated. This, in turn, destroys the livelihood of such people making it difficult for them to attain money, creating a gap between them and the well-off. \n Finally, when we look at technology's impact from an overall perspective, it is clear that it has resulted in equalizing the economic conditions of the people rather than creating a disparity of wealth as it has opened a vast variety of opportunities for people to attain a better earning and lifestyle.","Dear student, you have just managed to score a 1 with this essay.

However, it deviates from the original prompt, which specifically asked for a discussion on economic disparity caused by the availability of electronic devices. This misunderstanding led to the discussion veering away from the intended focus on the economic aspect of technology – particularly how owning or not owning gadgets might reflect one's financial status.

Firstly, the essay fails to directly address whether the availability of electronic gadgets is creating an economic gap between the rich and the poor, which was a key part of the original discussion prompt. Instead, two different topics were selected: the ease of accessing information and the impact of automation on lower-income individuals. Although these are relevant to the broader discussion on technology’s impacts, they do not squarely address the concern of economic disparity as dictated by the prompt.

Secondly, there are some inconsistencies in the arguments presented. The conclusion suggests that technology has equalized economic conditions, which contradicts the earlier point about automation worsening the economic condition of the less affluent. This inconsistent argumentation makes it difficult to ascertain a clear stance on the economic disparities caused by technology.

There are also a few areas for improvement in terms of writing mechanics:
- The phrase ""people of the worse end of the economic spectrum"" could be simplified to ""people on the lower end of the economic spectrum"" for clarity.
- The essay would benefit from more specific examples to support the discussed points. Concrete examples can help illustrate how technology impacts economic disparities.
- There were minor grammar hiccups, such as missing articles (""the"" common man) and some awkward phrasings (""boon for people of the worse end""), which detract from the overall clarity.

For future essays, focusing tightly on the essay prompt and ensuring that all discussion points are directly relevant to the question asked is crucial. This will help in crafting a more coherent and focused argument. It's also beneficial to review the essay to ensure that all points align and support each other, providing a consistent viewpoint throughout.

Firstly, expanding the essay to include a minimum of 275-300 words could significantly enhance its effectiveness. More detailed paragraphs would offer greater clarity and depth to the argument, which could improve the overall score. 

At the beginning of the essay, it would be beneficial to briefly outline the main reasons supporting the opinion. This approach would offer a clearer presentation of the author's viewpoint and set a structured tone for the discussion. 

In terms of content structure, the essay introduces a comparison of perspectives. While exploring different views can enrich an essay, it's important to focus on developing a single, clear stance throughout the piece, especially if the prompt does not explicitly ask for a comparison or discussion of opposing views. Strengthening the essay with specific, detailed reasons that support the main opinion without comparing it to opposing views will make the argument more persuasive and coherent.

The essay successfully identifies how songs can bridge cultural and age differences worldwide. However, for a clearer and stronger argument, it could benefit from elaborating on these points with more specific examples, particularly in discussing how understanding a country's music can lead to deeper cultural insights and relationships. Adding more detail about how songs embody the spirit of humanity or sharing additional examples similar to ""Waka-waka"" would also make the argument more vivid and convincing.

On a stylistic note, careful attention to grammar and spelling is generally good, but be mindful of repetitive phrases and ensure the essay flows smoothly from one idea to the next.

I think the media should change their object and pay more attention to the ordinary people. \n If the media continues concentrating on the lives and relationships of well-known people, it will put pressure on celebrities when they cannot live normally and comfortably like others. For example, there was many famous people put an end to their life because that was too much for them to bear. They do not have freedom to do normal things like go shopping, hang out with their friends and date in public when they are followed by paparazzi. That activities must be severely criticized when the life of stars is being violated. Therefore, the private lives of celebrities must be secured against and the media should usually report news about usual people. \n Secondly, the public almost do not care about the ordinary people life because there is no reason that the public can read more about them. They just interest in the famous people though there are also the large amount of the achievement that normal people gained. Such as volunteers who help the poor too much by their charity. Moreover, a businessman who try their best to establish and expand their businesses from starting-point and become successful businessman. In my opinion, the mass media should report the award of celebrities and ordinary people because it brings us a positive energy and encourages us to be more hard-working and active in the life. \n To sum up, I strongly believe that the mission of mass media is to convey the essential and good news about awards that man obtained.

However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing.

Firstly, it's crucial to ensure that your essay directly responds to the given topic. If the original topic asks for an opinion on the media's right to intrude on celebrities' privacy, your focus should be on discussing this aspect rather than suggesting the media should shift attention to ordinary people. Make sure your essay clearly addresses the prompt to stay relevant and score well.

Regarding the structure of your essay, introducing your opinion clearly and early, particularly in the introductory paragraph, is essential. Restate your opinion in the concluding paragraph to reinforce your position. This helps in making your viewpoint clear to the reader from the beginning and leaves them with a strong understanding of your stance on the topic by the end.

Moreover, your essay would benefit from more precise language and grammar corrections. For instance, using ""spends much time"" could be better expressed as ""spends a lot of time,"" and ""normal people are rarely appeared"" should be revised to ""ordinary people rarely appear.""

Do you \n agree or disagree \n ?,"THE LITERATURE AT SCHOOLS \n People think teaching students the literature of their own country will be better instead of other countries. While I accept that students should be encouraged literature works of their own culture, I also believe that studying foreign literature is equally fundamental. \n On the one hand, when students are acquired knowledge about their own culture by learning literature in their school, they are likely to enrich their knowledge and broaden their horizons about culture and tradition in their country. For instance, the folktale of the magic crossbow will help locals improve their patriotism and feel take pride in their culture. In addition, That will help to develope children's patriotism. For example, children are able to learn how to the ancestors went through various challenges to defeat invaders in order to protect their country through Thanh Giong folktale. Young generations are likely to know that they have to try to their best with the aim of contributing to develope their country \n On the other hand, I reckon that it is necessary for children to teach literature works of other countries that is equally fundamental. Not only can young generations be acquired knowledge of cultural value, but they also are able to know about traditional of each area in the world. In effect, it is not impossible that children will avoid a myriad of issues related to culture shock when they go to abroad, even work with foreign companies. In addition, if the students know traditional as well as historical heritage of their own country and other nations, they are likely to take problem under consideration according to many/various different aspects. That will help them develope better decision-making as well as problem-solving skills \n To sum up, for the reasons mentioned above, I personally believe that It is imperative for young generations to acquire knowledge of culture and traditional both their own countries and even foreign.","Dear student, it is evident that you have misunderstood the prompt you were provided for discussion. The prompt instruction is not asking you for a comparison discussion. It is asking for a single opinion discussion based on your agreement or non-agreement with the statement. There is no middle ground in a single opinion essay such as this one. You have to pick one side and defend it. Unless you are allowed to ""discuss both points of view"" by the original instruction, you should not do so. Let me outline the error in your response below: \n Original thesis question: Do you agree or disagree? \n Your Response: I also believe that studying foreign literature is equally fundamental. \n The question posed in the original thesis is based upon the discussion topic: Some people believe that it is more important to teach children the literature of their own country than other countries. \n Therefore, the appropriate response in your thesis sentence in this instance would have been: \n <em>I do not agree / I disagree with the given statement for several reasons.</em> \n You must always respond to the question using the given response parameters in the original prompt / instruction. When you do not do that, you end up straying from the original discussion point. So if you are asked to agree or disagree, then use one of the two keywords to respond in order to remain on track with your discussion. In this instance, you were not being asked what you believe in, you were being asked if you agreed or disagreed with the given statement. I am sure you can see how you strayed from the original topic for discussion based on your mistaken response. \n You are not responding to the prompt at all. Instead, you have created your own topic for discussion which will be considered a prompt deviation in an actual setting. Again, this is a single opinion essay discussion. You neither provided a single opinion nor discussed the prompt based on the given instructions.","The essay you've written on whether students should study literature from their own country or from other countries shows good effort in trying to cover both sides of the argument. However, it appears that there has been a misunderstanding regarding the type of response required for the question. The task was to take a stance by agreeing or disagreeing with a statement, rather than discussing both viewpoints. Let's go into more detail on how you can improve this essay based on this consideration and other aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The original question asked for a clear agreement or disagreement. Your response, however, treated the essay as a comparison between two points of view. In future essays, ensure to closely follow the instructions. If the question asks you to agree or disagree, your thesis statement should directly address this by stating, ""I agree because..."" or ""I disagree because..."" rather than presenting a balanced view. This will make your essay more focused and in line with the prompt's requirements.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While your essay demonstrates a good command of language, there are a few areas where you could improve. For instance, watch out for repetitive phrases and spelling inconsistencies (e.g., ""develope"" should be spelled as ""develop""). Also, make sure sentences are clear and properly structured to avoid confusion. Simplifying your language a little could also help make your arguments more accessible.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: As mentioned, the main issue is the essay tries to cover both sides rather than sticking to a single, clear point of view as required by the question. For future essays, clearly state your position right at the beginning and stick to it throughout the essay. This makes your point of view obvious to the reader from the start.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You have made attempts to support both views with examples and reasoning, which is good practice. However, based on the required essay structure, focusing on supporting just one side with clear and descriptive examples would strengthen your argument. This would mean choosing either the importance of studying one's own country's literature or the value of exploring foreign literature and then providing detailed support for that choice alone.

To sum up, remember to carefully read and respond directly to the essay question, improve on spelling and grammar, make your argument's structure clearer, and stick to a single point of view. These changes will not only address the prompt more accurately but also enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of your essays in the future.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,Argumentative

Nevertheless, it is believed that those buildings are becoming obsolete due to the existence of the internet and technology since people can observe everything through a computer screen. Personally, I strongly disagree with this perspective for the reasons below. \n Firstly, watching images or videos on a computer can only give people an overview of the artwork, and only by visiting the museum or gallery can they grasp the underlying meaning and the story behind each object. Commonly, the collections are set up in chronological or spatial order in museums and galleries, which purpose is to convey a particular message. There would have descriptions or notes to help people know what they are looking at. Also, there is a brief story to depict the progress and the origin of the displayed item therefore, people can draw lessons from it. \n Secondly, physical contact, such as touching, smelling, and looking directly at the works of art, can benefit students studying art majors. For example, going to an art exhibition helps pupils have chances to scrutinize those masterpieces giving them more inspiration and ideas for their own assignments. On top of that, they can recognize the material and structure of the oeuvre, like how marvelous the paint was mixed or the picture main layout, which people would overlook when watching low-quality images or videos. \n In conclusion, I believe museums and art galleries are essential and will exist throughout the ages without being outdated. Since those places hold history and tangible value, which proves the creativity and the development progress of humanity","There are 2 different agree or disagree types of discussion. One is the simple do you agree or disagree statement, which does not need an exaggerated response to the question. The other, is the extent essay, which requires a measured, emotional, and exaggerated response.

Use the correct format depending upon the type of question provided. \n Good job on the single opinion explanations in the discussion paragraphs. These were on point and believable. The problem, is that your sentence formation is sometimes incorrect and, you did not really use the required mix of sentence types in the paragraphs.

Your stance is clear, and you provide reasoned arguments to support your viewpoint, which is a strength of your essay. However, there are areas where your essay could benefit from improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of my feedback focusing on the aspects of response to the topic, spelling, grammar, stylistic issues, clarity of viewpoint, and argument support:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay directly addresses the question, providing a firm stance against the notion that museums and galleries are becoming obsolete. This direct approach is suitable for the essay type. You effectively use the essay to argue your point with relevant examples, maintaining focus on the topic throughout.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While your ideas are clear, there are instances where incorrect sentence structures and language use create some confusion. Improving sentence variety can make your writing more engaging and help better convey complex ideas. Consider revising sentences that seem awkward or unclear, and ensure you're using a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences to express your ideas more fluidly. Reviewing grammar rules and practicing sentence structures can significantly enhance your essay's readability and effectiveness.

3. **Clarity of Viewpoint**: Your viewpoint is clear throughout the essay, which is a strong point. However, to further improve, ensure that each paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence that states the main idea you will discuss. This approach will help readers understand your argument's direction from the outset of each paragraph.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: You provide descriptive examples to support your viewpoint, such as the importance of physical interaction with artworks for students. To strengthen your arguments further, consider adding more specific details or concrete examples that highlight the unique benefits of experiencing art in person. Additionally, exploring potential counterarguments and providing rebuttals can enrich your essay by showing a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

**Additional Point for Consideration**:

It's essential to pay attention to the instructions given for essay prompts. The feedback indicates a need to distinguish between simple agreement/disagreement essays and those requiring a more measured or nuanced approach. For this essay, focusing on providing direct and straightforward arguments was suitable, but remember to adjust your writing style and depth of response based on the specific requirements of each prompt.

Overall, you have demonstrated a good understanding of the essay topic and the ability to construct an argument. Focusing on refining your sentence structure, grammar, and depth of argument will greatly improve your writing and help achieve a better score.

Before giving a reasonable answer to that it is important to look at the debate from following angles. \n On the one hand, many people believe that calculator is vital demand which serves for education purposes. In other words, this may be regarded as in the education programs, the student should apply to methods about using calculator to do exactly their homework. Perhaps one typical reason why that argument remains valid is using calculator is to conduct in the school because it helps pupils can be easy to do homework and save time; hence, students can have leisure time to relaxing by participating plenty of outdoor activities. More importantly, a considerable factor that could justify this is electronic calculators can help student check the result accurately when they cannot meet the teacher to finding answers on holiday or on the weekends. All things considered, electronic calculator is a benefit equipment which offers high accuracy. \n On the other hand, some individuals agree that many children are need to learn mental arithmetic proficiently before using calculator. From another perspective, we can see that people who give some this idea desire their children can be become more flexible in many situations when pupils do not have nearby calculator. Therefore, almost parents just only allow their children to use this assistance when they have enough age so these parents admire many schools where should apply to use calculator for children to over 12-year-old because the parents believe that in this age many pupils maybe have some correct cognitions. There exist examples of such, and the clearest one is the case of in the present, more and more many schools all around the world start a variety of researches and tests of mental arithmetic methods like in Indian country, many children are learnt a method what helps them calculate quickly by using some fingers to count. In short, many good methods that have been implemented and are being implemented until now. In my opinion, I think it is very fundamental and important to study by mental arithmetic without depend on electronic calculators. \n In conclusion, this writing examinies a variety of aspects of the given question. Taking a broader speculation of the matter, the result also lies in how people from various backgrounds and ages might interpret it.

Unfortunately, in a task 2 essay, a non- response tothe direct question is worse than giving an opinion. That is because your essay changed the discussion formatto a comparative discussion rather than a single opinion defense. \n Your prompt restatement does not offer a clear line of discussion for the presentation. When a thesis statement is not present, it becomes difficult to follow the flour of discussion. Why was there a sudden reference toa government solution?

My current review is based on an assumption. Provide the prompt next time to recieve an accurate review.","The essay addresses an important topic regarding the use of electronic calculators by children and their impact on learning. Reviewing your essay, I've noted several areas where improvements are needed to enhance clarity, coherence, and effectiveness in communicating your viewpoint. Here are some suggestions for revision:

1. **Response to the Topic:** It's challenging to assess the essay's alignment with the original prompt without seeing it. However, the essay seems to wander between comparing the benefits and drawbacks of calculator use without taking a clear stance. A strong essay typically responds directly to the question asked, making your position evident. Consider stating your opinion more clearly in the introduction and conclusion to make sure readers know where you stand on the issue.

2. **Clarity and Organization:** The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. An effective essay typically begins with an introduction that includes a thesis statement outlining the main arguments that will be discussed. Each paragraph should focus on a single point, supported by examples or evidence, leading to a well-defined conclusion that restates your position and summarizes key arguments. Try to introduce your points in a logical order and use transitional phrases to guide the reader through your arguments.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that make the essay difficult to follow at times. Pay attention to sentence structure, and strive for clear and concise sentences. Additionally, watch out for spelling errors and make sure to use the correct tense and agreement between subjects and verbs. A thorough proofreading session can significantly improve the readability of your essay.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details:** The essay mentions several arguments both for and against the use of calculators but often lacks detailed examples and evidence to support these points. For a more persuasive essay, consider including specific studies, statistics, or real-world examples that demonstrate the impact of calculator use on children's education. Additionally, ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single argument to avoid confusion.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendation:** The conclusion introduces the idea of government policies regarding calculator use, which feels somewhat abrupt as this solution wasn't discussed earlier in the essay. A strong conclusion should summarize the key points made in the essay and reinforce your viewpoint, rather than introducing new ideas. If discussing potential solutions is crucial to your argument, make sure to introduce and explore these ideas throughout the essay, not just at the end.

By focusing on these areas, the essay can be significantly improved to more effectively communicate your perspective on the use of electronic calculators in education. Taking the time to revise for clarity, coherence, and detailed argumentation will make your writing more persuasive and impactful.",3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,4,1,Argumentative

In my opinion, I consider both arguments have their merits, however despite the drawback, it is still much beneficial to the country of such event. \n First, a sport event is considered a tool used for supporting the economic development of a country. This means that the country can utilize an event for encouraging more spending, which enhances the economic consumer price index (CPI). For example, the events such as the World cup and Olympics are competitively fought for the right of hosting among countries, since these can bring billions of dollars to the country by attracting tourists across the world to travel in and spend a huge amount of money for various types of service. \n On the other hand, it is evident that an event can also create detrimental effects on the country. In fact, there are obvious risks caused by the event which could threaten the health system of the country. For instance, in the Covid pandemic, the communicable disease seems hard to be prevented from infection, especially in a sport event where a lot of people carrying disease from different regions gather in the same place. In this situation, the country needs to put a lot of effort to avoid from badly impacted by the event. \n In conclusion, although the negative impacts might happen due to the event, I still believe that hosting a sport brings many benefits far more than the disadvantage","Note the opinion basis as provided. One opinion is represented as, \n <quotation>Some people</quotation> \n . While the other side considers, \n <quotation>while some people</quotation> \n . This represents the need for a third person discussion consideration twice in the essay.

Try to successfully explain why you oppose or support it. Make sure the correct pronouns are used to represent the discussion. At this point, only the writers general opinion is present. This will recieve a score but, due to the inaccurate format, cannot recieve full marks in the TA section.","Your essay provides a thoughtful analysis on the benefits and drawbacks of hosting an international event in a country. However, to enhance your essay and better articulate your viewpoints, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Topic Relevance**: You have addressed the assigned topic well by examining both the advantages and disadvantages of hosting an international event. To further improve, explicitly state the essay question in your introduction for a clear and direct response to the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Overall, your essay is well-written, but there are a few areas where you could make improvements:
   - Watch out for missing articles such as ""the"" before ""Covid pandemic"" and ""a sport event.""
   - Ensure consistent tense usage. For instance, when discussing the impact of events like the World Cup and Olympics, maintain the same tense to enhance readability.
   - Consider varying your sentence structures to enhance the fluidity of your writing.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your position is clear but needs to be grounded in a broader perspective. Instead of framing the discussion as just your opinion, acknowledge public opinions or research findings to strengthen your argument. For example, when mentioning advantages and disadvantages, it would be beneficial to cite specific studies or statistics that support your claims.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments provide a good basis for your perspective; however, they can be further strengthened.
   - When discussing economic benefits, include specific examples or data to substantiate your claims.
   - Address the health risks more comprehensively by not only highlighting the potential dangers but also suggesting measures that can mitigate these risks, providing a more balanced view.

To enhance the depth of your analysis, it is crucial to integrate multiple viewpoints into your discussion. Rather than solely relying on your personal opinion, incorporate a third-person perspective to discuss public opinions or findings on the topic. This approach not only enriches your argument but also aligns with academic writing standards which require objective analysis.

Moreover, balancing the use of pronouns can improve the clarity of your perspective. For instance, when you express personal positions, make sure it's clear whether you are stating your opinion or summarizing public sentiment. This distinction is important for readers to understand the basis of your argument better.

Incorporating these changes will not only align your essay more closely with the expectations of an academic audience but also provide a more comprehensive and persuasive argument.

I totally agree with this statement, and this essay will explain why. \n People, who disagree with the idea that spoken communication is more beneficial than written communication, may argue that written communication is more accessible, as messages can be viewed anywhere. However, while it can be true in the day of old when letters are still the dominant way to get in touch, time has changed advanced technology nowadays allows users to communicate regardless of time and space; for example, within a click of mouse, people can make a video call through Facebook or other online apps to have a conversation with business partners or their friends and family. Therefore, with the help of technology, oral communication is becoming more effective than spoken communication. \n The reason why I am on the side of this idea is because spoken communication requires direct interaction between speakers . Therefore, the negotiation of meanings during the conversation will be facilitated, which is crucial for mutual understanding and reaching the decision. Such a thing can still be achieved in written communication when writers devote time and effort to convey the meaning of the message to readers by using precise grammar and vocabulary . However, this process can be simplified in face-to-face communication with the help of direct connection; therefore, oral communication is more efficient than written communication. \n In brief, it is much easier and more convenient to express ideas through spoken communication; as a result, oral communication plays a more vital role than the written ones in our life.","<quotation>and this essay will explain why.</quotation> \n Remember that the task accuracy score will be based on the clarity of your opinion.

The overall scoring requirements have been met well enough to recieve a slightly higher than average score.","This essay presents a well-argued case for the superiority of oral over written communication, asserting that oral communication is more important due to its efficiency and directness. The topic is addressed comprehensively; however, there are opportunities for improvement in both structure and clarity to enhance the essay's effectiveness.

1. **Clarity and Structure**: 
   The introduction sets a clear direction by stating agreement with the statement that oral communication is more important. However, it could be strengthened by directly including the reasons for this agreement within the opening statements. Instead of simply stating ""this essay will explain why,"" incorporating specific reasons would make the opinion stronger and more compelling from the outset.

2. **Avoiding Redundancy**:
   The essay sometimes repeats the assertion of agreement with the topic at hand, such as in ""The reason why I am on the side of this idea."" Redundancy can dilute the impact of your arguments. Instead, focus on diving directly into your explanations or evidence without reiterating your position. This will make your argumentation more dynamic and engaging.

3. **Grammar and Vocabulary**:
   There are minor spelling and stylistic issues that should be addressed. For example, ""time has changed advanced technology nowadays allows"" could be more clearly expressed as ""technological advancements have now changed how we communicate, allowing..."" Additionally, the essay mistakenly refers to oral communication as ""more effective than spoken communication,"" which is redundant since both terms refer to the same mode of communication. Attention to such details will improve the readability of your essay.

4. **Evidence and Arguments**:
   The arguments supporting the importance of oral communication are well-developed and persuasive, particularly with the mention of technology's role in facilitating real-time conversation. However, the conclusion could be more impactful by reiterating the main reasons supporting the thesis in a paraphrased form, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive ending to the essay.

5. **Conclusion**:
   While the conclusion summarizes the essay's main point, it could be enhanced by echoing the reasons presented in the body in a fresh manner. This reinforces the arguments made and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.

In summary, this essay effectively responds to the topic, demonstrating clear reasoning and providing relevant examples. Focusing on refining the introduction, avoiding redundancy, correcting minor errors, and enhancing the conclusion will elevate the overall quality and coherence of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay seems to misunderstand the initial prompt's requirements. The prompt asks to agree or disagree with a given statement, but the essay instead focuses on discussing the importance of relaxing and reducing stress. It's vital to carefully read and understand the prompt to ensure that the response directly answers the question asked. To improve, try to reframe your essay to clearly state whether you agree or disagree with the specified statement and then provide reasons supporting that stance.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are some minor grammatical errors and areas where sentence structure could be improved for clarity. For example, consider revising phrases like ""comparing to spending time with other people"" to ""compared to spending time with other people"" for grammatical correctness. Also, watch out for the consistency of verb tenses and subject-verb agreement to ensure your writing flows smoothly.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: While your point of view on the importance of spending time alone is clear, it's not directly responding to the essay's prompt. Ensure your viewpoint is explicitly stated in relation to the question posed by the prompt for a more focused and coherent essay.

4. **Support for the Author's Position**: You provide descriptive arguments supporting the benefits of spending time alone, such as organizing thoughts, resting the body, and enjoying cheap thrills. These arguments are well-explained and support your position. However, to align with the prompt, it's necessary to reshape these arguments to directly respond to the topic of stress in relation to the statement provided. For example, if the prompt asks whether you agree that stress is both necessary and harmful, you could use your ideas about spending time alone as evidence of how to mitigate the harmful aspects of stress.

To summarize, the essay has a promising foundation with interesting ideas but needs significant revision to align with the requirements of the proficiency test. Focus on understanding the prompt, directly answering the question posed, addressing any grammatical and stylistic issues, and ensuring your arguments explicitly support your position in relation to the prompt.

They could believe in their neighbors because they understood them very clearly. They would feel safe and the crime rate was very low. Secondly, everyone could help their neighbors when necessary. The children always had someone to look after, or if you went out, your next-door friend kept your delivery goods and watched out your house. Finally, in a small group, everyone was very closed and you never felt lonely. They usually held small gatherings, parties every week to make this relationship be cohesive. The life here is simple but happy. \n However, there were many difficult if people just lived here. Almost the villages were very poor without convenient infrastructures: modern hospitals, internet services,... Also, because of the undeveloped traffic and the large distance, it took many hours to go to the nearest schools, factories, especially hospital and police station in emergency situations. Besides, in suburban, agriculture occupies the majority, so every family had financial problems. Only young people could go to big cities to have more opportunities. Finally, because of the small views, their knowledge and relationship was very limited. \n In conclusion, I think these disadvantages are outweigh advantages. Nowadays, with the development of technology, living in a big city is more convenient and easily to find better jobs. But if you want, you can also make a suitable small community with your neighbors.","As it is at the moment, there are a number of problems in relation to the formatting and discussion of your work. Let me explain things to you in a more detailed manner. \n Your Task Accuracy score will come from the first paragraph that you write. In this paragraph, you should not begin the discussion of the prompt. This is always allotted for your proof of English comprehension skills. So the main requirement is that you accurately restate the prompt topic and instructions within 5 sentences. Let me show you an example based upon this prompt: \n <em>Before people began to live in urban cities, they used to live in tightly knit, small communities. Due to the change in residential preference, from small to large, people now tend to not know who their neighbors are, when compared to the less populated towns. Each living style has its own advantages and disadvantages. I will present a discussion of both sides in this essay.</em> \n Notice how I did my best to stay as close to the original prompt presentation while using various versions of the keywords ""small vllages"" and ""large cities""? This presentation has a purpose. I am trying to show the examiner that I not only understand what the topic for discussion is and how I am expected to discuss it, but also, that I have a wide range of English vocabulary that will allow me to vary my presentation while keeping the original meaning of the term. That is how you score better in the TA section. \n Since this is not an opinion essay but rather a general discussion presentation, there is no need to use personal phrases such as ""In my view"". The expectation is that you will present popular opinions and evidences in this discussion. So a personal connection to the statement being made is not required. \n More importantly, you must understand that you are scored considerably in the C&C and GRA section. These two sections are practically scored hand in hand. So you need to make sure that you offer the requirements of the paragraphs, without over doing it. That means, you only present one topic as the reason in the discussion, then follow it up with public opinion and general examples in order to support the argument you are presenting. With a 5 sentence maximum requirement per paragraph, you really do not have room to present more than one topic for discussion. The clarity of your explanation is more important than the number of reasons you provide in a single presentation. \n Do not use special characters such as ellipses (...) in the essay. That removes the academic tone of the presentation. Punctuation marks like that are used only in creative writing essays. Try to cut your sentences into short presentations instead of as run-on sentences divided only by commas. That causes undue stress on the reader and lowers your GRA score immensely. \n In the conclusion, you made a prompt deviation by saying ""I think these disadvantages are outweigh advantages"". The purpose of the closing statement is the same as the opening statement. Only this time, you restate the important discussion points from your presentation. It is still paraphrasing so you cannot continue the discussion nor create a prompt deviation in that paragraph. You will lose major points for that in the TA section. \n I decided to point out the problem points of your essay rather than reviewing the content and grammar problems of your work. That is not our major concern at this moment. What we have to make sure of right now, is that you learn how to properly develop this type of essay discussion for your scoring benefit.","Here is some feedback to help improve your essay on the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community.

**1. Addressing the Topic Properly:**
It’s essential to restate the topic accurately in your introduction. Instead of jumping directly into your opinions or discussion, briefly summarize the essay prompt in your own words, highlighting both views (advantages and disadvantages) without sharing personal opinions right away. For example, you could begin by noting the historical preference for living in small communities and how this has evolved over time. This not only shows comprehension of the topic but also showcases your ability to use varied vocabulary related to the subject.

**2. Presentation Style and Tone:**
Your essay should maintain a formal and academic tone. Avoid using personal pronouns such as ""I"" unless specifically asked for your opinion, and consider discussing public opinions or commonly held views on the topic instead. Additionally, avoid using ellipses (...) or other informal punctuation marks; they are more suitable for creative writing than academic essays.

**3. Structure and Clarity:**
Focus on presenting one clear topic or argument per paragraph. Support each argument with relevant examples or general public opinions. Since there's a limit to how much you can include in each paragraph, clarity and conciseness are crucial. Overloading paragraphs with too many ideas can confuse your reader and weaken your argument.

**4. Specific Language and Grammar:**
Be mindful of grammar and word choice throughout your essay. Phrases like ""There are always 2 main areas which is contrary"" could be clearer and grammatically correct. For example, ""There are always two main contrasting areas in every country: suburban areas and big cities."" Also, work on maintaining consistent tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement.

**5. Concluding Your Essay:**
In your conclusion, avoid introducing new ideas or opinions. Instead, briefly restate the main points you’ve discussed, emphasizing the balance between advantages and disadvantages without showing a bias towards one. Ensure you do not deviate from the prompt's requirements in this concluding part.

**General Advice:**
- Use precise and varied vocabulary to express your thoughts clearly.
- Aim for short, clear sentences to convey your arguments without overwhelming the reader.
- Always check your essay for spelling and grammatical errors before finalizing it.

By focusing on these areas, your essays will become more structured, coherent, and engaging, adhering to the expectations of academic writing.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative
4252,https://essayforum.com/writing/economic-progress-92572/,test,IELTS WRITING TASK 2 - Economic progress VS Other progress,"For many nations of the world, economy is regarded as the most desirable achievement there is. While economy is certainly relevant to the survival of a country, I opine that there are many more respects to it than just financial well-being. \n On the one hand, those who prioritize only their economical goals have their defensible grounds. Firstly, the financial health of the state is one the foundational elements in maintaining its aspects, whether it be health care, education, or science and technology. Most researches as well as advancements require some sort of governmental funding, which is only available if the country is thriving economically. Secondly, an economy plays a decisive role in the people's well-being. With a successful economy comes higher living standards, better health care and education and decrease in crimes due to better job opportunities. In short, the importance of the economy to a nation is equivalent to that of the spine to a body. \n On the other hand, to only prioritize one's economy would be insufficient, other factors, such as the environment, should be taken into consideration as well. As can be observed from history, the process of industrialization and modernization has caused nature to suffer incredibly. In the exemplary case of China and India, their industrial developments, which have lead to buoyant economies, engendered air pollution to exacerbate. It was so serious that not until the Covid pandemic put their economical activities into a complete halt could the heavy dust clouds be ameliorated, the sky be seen and the people breathe safely without masks. \n In conclusion, even though essentializing the economy is sensible, it is advisable for authorities to also take environmental issues and the such just as seriously.","The prompt restatement is inaccurate. It fails to represent both public opinions prior to the writer's point of view on the matter. Therefore, his opinion and personal reasoning, as stated, tends to lack validity. The paragraph can only receive a partial TA score since the presentation is only partially accurate. \n The discussion fails to properly compare the basis of the public reason with his own. The strength of his opinion in this type of writing comes from his ability to fairly opine based on the public perception. Why does he believe one POV to be true and the other false? How does his personal reasoning fit in the context of both public perceptions? The current discussion is generally based on a personal point of view alone which does not create an open discussion of the 2 public opinions as per the prompt requirements.","Your essay on the importance of economy versus other aspects of national development provides an interesting perspective. Here, we will explore some areas for improvement and highlight the strengths of your work to make it even more compelling and relevant to the topic.

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's crucial for your essay to fully address the prompt by presenting and weighing both public opinions before introducing your personal stance. The introduction of your essay would benefit from a clearer representation of these opposing views to provide a balanced foundation for your argument. This approach not only strengthens the validity of your position but also ensures a comprehensive response to the topic. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Overall, your essay is well-written with minor spelling or grammatical errors. However, paying attention to the precision of language can further enhance the clarity of your message. For instance, using ""economy"" and ""economical goals"" interchangeably could be confusing; ""economic goals"" might be more accurate. Additionally, strive for variety in your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. You've done well to express your opinion that while the economy is essential, other factors like the environment should not be overlooked. To amplify your argument, compare your perspective directly with public opinions. This comparison will help underline why you find your position more plausible or appealing based on the broader context.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You've provided strong arguments to support your position, particularly with the examples of China and India relating to environmental concerns. To further enhance your essay, consider equally discussing the strengths and potential weaknesses or limitations of concentrating solely on economic development. Delving into how your reasoning aligns or contrasts with public perceptions will enrich your argument, making it more comprehensive and persuasive.

Remember, a successful essay not only presents a well-supported argument but also engages with contrasting viewpoints to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic. By incorporating these suggestions, you will significantly improve the depth, coherence, and effectiveness of your essay. Keep up the good work, and consider these points as opportunities for growth in your writing skills.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4253,https://essayforum.com/writing/contrast-paragraph-adulthood-childhood-78555/,test,Contrast paragraph between adulthood and childhood.,"Life between adulthood and childhood are strikingly different in a couple of aspects. Firstly, children have been well nurtured and sufficiently educated on a regular basis by their families and teachers. However, when they have grown older and become adults, those children have to take more responsibility of their families and themselves as well. Another aspect is that a majority of children have enough time to indulge in their favorite books or other sources of information, and this helps widen their social knowledge and enhance their imagination. Adults, nevertheless, are fully occupied with loads of tasks and have insufficient time to entertain themselves. This can be patiently obvious as in the hustle and bustle pace of modern life, these adults are likely to handle deadlines in their workplace. Lastly, creating harmonious relationship is advisable for those adults who want to go further or even get promoted in their career, meaning that they can succeed in their own fields by cooperating with their colleagues. Conversely, children live harmony with their friends and do not strike up any relationship on purpose. In conclusion, these aforementioned discrepancies can be widely regconized in every corner of the world.","It is best to not count off the facts you are presenting if you cannot do it consistently in the essay presentation. You started off with ""firstly"" then used other variations like ""additionally"", ""another aspect"" and sometimes, you don't refer to a count off at all. So it is best to not use that format because you will tend to forget to use it continuously in the essay. It will not have a bearing on your paper if you don't do that. In fact, it will create a smoother presentation that will allow the sentences to better connect in the presentation. Counting it off sounds like you are outlining information rather than discussing it. Your essay paragraph would have been more convincing if you made it seem like children also have duties such as the chores they have to do around the house to help their parents like washing dishes and similar actions. Comparing responsibilities would have, in my opinion, been the best approach to discussing the comparison paragraph.","The submitted essay clearly addresses the topic, comparing life between adulthood and childhood. However, there's room for improvement in several areas to enhance clarity, coherence, and argument strength. Here's how:

1. **Consistency in Structure**: The essay begins with an ordered format, starting with ""Firstly,"" but then deviates to terms like ""Another aspect"" and sometimes doesn't use transitional phrases at all. Maintaining a consistent structure throughout the essay will make your arguments clearer and more compelling. Instead of listing points, weave them together in a narrative or discussion format. This approach enhances the flow and makes your essay more engaging.

2. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are minor spelling and grammatical issues, such as ""Life between adulthood and childhood are"" where it should be ""is"" since the subject 'Life' is singular. Additionally, ""regconized"" should be spelled as ""recognized."" Paying attention to these details will improve the overall quality and readability of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Argument and POV**: Your point of view is clear – you believe there are distinct differences between childhood and adulthood. However, you could deepen your argument by providing more specific examples and explaining how these differences impact individuals. For example, when discussing responsibilities, mention specific childhood chores to draw a direct comparison with adult responsibilities. This will make your argument more relatable and persuasive.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: While you've outlined general differences, incorporating more vivid descriptions or personal anecdotes could enhance your points. For example, describe the sense of imagination a child feels when reading their favorite book versus the lack of time an adult has for such leisure activities. Doing so could vividly illustrate your points and engage the reader more effectively.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Adding statistical data, quotes from experts, or findings from reputable studies could further support your claims. These pieces of evidence add credibility to your argument and demonstrate a well-researched position.

6. **Elimination of Redundancies**: Phrases like ""strikingly different in a couple of aspects"" can be simplified to ""strikingly different"" to avoid redundancy and sharpen your argument's presentation.

By addressing these points, you'll not only refine your essay's structure and coherence but also strengthen your argument and engage your readers more effectively. Remember, clarity, consistency, and compelling evidence are key to a successful essay.",4,3,4,4,2,3,3,4,3,1,Analytical

For example, it might have a historical value that they want to understand more and feel proud of where they live. In Vietnam, some houses that used to be a base for the military's secret meetings in the war in 1954 and the tools, furniture, antiques are still kept until today in order to display for guests who feel interested in discovering. By contrast, people find information about the buildings or the apartments might be because of safety reasons or in rare cases because of spiritual belief. For instance, in America, there are some houses that used to have a crime like suicide or even worse like murder, people tend to feel scared and afraid to move in as they want to avoid any supernatural events that might occur in their houses in the near future. Another reason might be because of safety reasons such as the facilities in the old building like the pumps, the fire staircases, or fire alarm system. \n People who feel interested in discovering the history of the house can find information from several trustworthy sources. For example, they can look for the data from the real estate agencies which provide them the information about when did the houses were built, how many owners it has, or even how many times that the houses were rent or bought. Especially in America, there is a famous agency name Zillow, this one is providing this kind of information for all their clients. In addition, the internet is the easiest source to access for any kind of information or easier that they can just talk to their neighbors. \n To conclude, there are several reasons that people want to find data about where they live, it might be because of safety reasons or avoid the buildings which have a lot of rumors about the supernatural events. People can look for information on the internet, their neighbors, and real estate agencies, or even the community libraries.","The prompt restatement has deviated from the original topic, eason for the topic, and opinion statement.

However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to align the essay more closely with the topic and enhance its overall quality.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The initial presentation of the essay diverges from what seems to be the central focus: why people are interested in the history of their homes and how they find this information. It's crucial to ensure the response directly addresses the question, sticking to the relevance of residential histories rather than extending to broader historical or museum-like settings. This distinction is vital for meeting the task's requirements.

2. **Repetition and Clarity:**
Avoiding repetition is important to maintain the reader's interest and keep the essay concise. The phrase ""Nowadays, people tend to find more information about where they live because of some reason"" is repetitive and vague. It is beneficial to mention the central theme concisely in the introduction and then elaborate on it in the body without unnecessary repetition.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
While the essay has a good basic structure, attention to grammar and stylistic choices will enhance its readability and coherence. For instance, refining sentences for clarity and using a variety of sentence structures can make the arguments more compelling. Paying attention to the correct usage of articles (""the"" and ""a"") and prepositions will also improve the essay's quality.

4. **Author's Point of View:**
The essay's point of view on why individuals explore the history of their living spaces is somewhat clear yet could be strengthened with a more definite stance or opinion. It's beneficial to explicitly state the main reasons in the introduction, followed by detailed exploration in the body paragraphs.

5. **Arguments and Support:**
The essay mentions several reasons for the interest in residential history, including historical value, safety concerns, and supernatural beliefs. To reinforce these points, providing specific examples or data would be helpful. The use of sources like real estate agencies and the internet is well noted, but expanding on how these sources can be utilized effectively would offer a more persuasive argument.

In conclusion, focusing on clearly addressing the topic, minimizing repetition, improving grammar and style, clarifying the point of view, and providing more detailed supporting arguments will significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness. Concentrating on these improvements will make the essay more engaging and informative, meeting the expectations more successfully.",4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Informative
4255,https://essayforum.com/writing/older-generations-traditional-moral-93719/,test,IELTS WRITING TASK 2: OLDER GENERATIONS' TRADITIONAL MORAL CODES,"Many traditional moral codes have been passed on for generations. However, much controversy still surrounds the helpfulness of these ideas in facilitating younger generations' future in modern society. From my perspective, except for some obsolete notions, most of the traditional ideas are valuable to younger offspring. \n Obviously, older generations maintain a number of inappropriate stereotypes. According to those, homosexuality and feminism are deemed to deviate, or even violate the common norms. Such kinds of discrimination have put women and minor groups of the society at a disadvantage and thus hindered them from seizing many opportunities in life and profession. This situation is inevitably against modern society's targets to promote equality and human rights. Additionally, conventional perceptions advise people, especially low-class and working-class ones, to stay restrained and suffer in any cases of discontent in order to maintain a so-called peaceful life. However, this idea may adversely affect the principles of democracy and civilization of humankind. Only by freedom of speech can burning issues be brought up and tackled. \n Despite aforementioned limitations, traditional teachings still sustain lasting values to young generations. This is because those lessons which have been acquired and revised throughout history assemble older generations' knowledge and experience. In order to thrive in modern age, young people should preserve and promote those notions in accordance with contemporary situation. Take, for example, Vietnam where the forefathers always teach their offspring about the tradition of patriotism. That trait was the core factor which helped them overcome a millennium of Northern domination and win two resistance wars against the mightiest empires then. That heritage presents its unchanged value as young patriots are crucial for maintaining cultural character and national independence in the era of profound globalization. \n In conclusion, much as some conventional ideas are somewhat invalid in modern days, the core notions remain precious to young generations as those values are obligatory conditions for the sustainable prosperity of modern society. \n (318 words)","In the writer's opinion presentation, an invalid response format was used since it did not use the key phrase response expectation. Rather than saying \n <quotation>From my perspective</quotation> \n the opening phrase should have been, <em>""I partially disagree with this statement because some obsolete... ""</em> \n in order to meet the extent response requirement. Note that the opinion included the required thesis statement to complete the reasoning process. \n The second reasoning paragraph should have been the first reasoning statement since it directly relates to the writer's opinion and discussion basis. It is strong and perfect in explanation. A similar 2nd reasoning paragraph along the same lines would have been even better. \n Therefore, the essay will be scored based on an incomplete reasoning development since the other paragraph is not aligned with the given thesis statement. It will lower the final score to a great extent.","The essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the relevance and value of traditional moral codes in modern society. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance clarity, coherence, and alignment with typical essay requirements for English proficiency tests. Here's a breakdown based on the outlined aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay addresses the prompt by evaluating the role of traditional moral codes for younger generations. However, the introduction could be strengthened by directly stating agreement or disagreement with the prompt using a clear thesis statement format, like ""I partially disagree with this statement because some obsolete ideas..."" Instead of the more personal ""From my perspective."" This adjustment will better meet the expectations for essay responses.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay is generally well-written but could benefit from minor adjustments for improved readability and formality. Avoiding colloquial phrases and ensuring consistent use of more formal language would enhance its overall presentation. Also, it's essential to meticulously monitor for punctuation and grammatical accuracy throughout.

3. **Author's Point of View:** The point of view is clear, as the essay articulates a stance that acknowledges the value of traditional teachings while critiquing their application in modern contexts. However, emphasizing this stance more explicitly at the beginning could help readers better understand the essay's direction from the outset.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The structure of the essay introduces two main arguments: the drawbacks of traditional ideas and their enduring value. The argument concerning the negative aspects of traditional views on issues like homosexuality and feminism is compelling and directly supports the essay's thesis. It would be beneficial to start with this argument to solidify the thesis statement's stance. Additionally, providing another argument that aligns closely with the critique of outdated norms, as suggested, would improve the essay's coherence and depth. The second part of the essay offers a positive view on traditional values, exemplified by the discussion on patriotism in Vietnam, which effectively illustrates the essay's nuanced perspective but should logically follow after reinforcing the critique of outdated norms.

To make the essay more effective, consider revising the structure to present arguments in a sequence that builds upon the thesis more cohesively. Highlight each point with specific examples and ensure that all arguments directly relate back to the central statement regarding the relevance of traditional values in the modern age. By refining these elements, the essay will present a more compelling and structured argument that fulfills the expectations of English proficiency tests.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

To be specific, mass communications portrays the modern and comfortable live in the metropolitan areas encourage young people to strive for a better future. Moreover, children often want to fulfill the wish of their parents with their future. For instance, in my hometown, 90 percent of young people who are 18 years old enough will go to big cities to have a job or achieve higher education. With them, this is an opportunity to have a well-paid job and a better future for not only them but also their kids. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the increasing number of young people leaving hometown has a negative impact on the development at all. That leads to the lack of a workforce and the adverse affection on economic improvement. While there are only old people who do not have the ability to work, the quality and the quantity of products will reduce. Thus, the revenue from production and trade activities will be lower. As a result, the countryside can not develop the economy and the living standards of residents could not be improved. According to a report on VTV, in the countryside, old people and kids live without adults who have enough ability to work.

The current essay primarily focuses on the negative effects of migration to cities without adequately exploring the benefits. To improve, ensure that both sides are equally represented to adhere to the guidelines of a balanced discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is mostly well-written but could benefit from closer attention to grammatical structures and style. For instance, phrases like “modern and comfortable live in the metropolitan areas” could be revised for clarity and correctness to “modern and comfortable life in metropolitan areas.” It’s also vital to maintain consistency in verb tenses and to utilize transitions smoothly to connect ideas more cohesively.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your stance on this issue is clear; you believe that the migration trend has negative consequences for rural areas. However, the presentation of your viewpoint could be strengthened by incorporating a balanced examination of both sides of the issue, as required by the essay prompt. This balance will not only show a comprehensive understanding of the topic but also allow for a more nuanced discussion.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You provided a personal observation and referenced a report to back your points, which is good practice. To further solidify your arguments, consider including more diverse sources of evidence, such as statistics, studies, or expert opinions, for both the advantages and disadvantages. Also, it would be beneficial to explore and describe some positive aspects of city life and counterbalance them with the advantages of living in the countryside.

**Structure**: Your essay currently does not follow the recommended format of a standard discussion essay, which usually includes an introduction stating the topic and your main opinion, two reasoning paragraphs presenting detailed arguments for each side, and a concluding paragraph summarizing the discussion. Adhering to this structure would not only make your essay more organized but also ensure it meets the requirements of the test.

Moreover, the use of more varied sentence structures could enhance readability.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay's point of view seems to focus on highlighting the importance of the discovery for scientific research. Reinforce this perspective by consistently using evidence-based statements that emphasize the discovery's implications for understanding volcanic eruptions and continental crust formation.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay mentions an experiment conducted by Blundy's team, it could benefit from more explicit and descriptive arguments supporting why this discovery is significant. Detailing how this experiment led to new insights or hypotheses about volcanic activity could strengthen the essay's argumentative aspect.

To further improve, the essay could also include references or allusions to existing research or sources where readers could verify the presented information. While the original article's URL wasn't provided, acknowledging sources or further readings adds credibility to your essay.

Overall, there is a strong foundation here with the chosen topic and some information provided. To elevate your essay, focus on enhancing the clarity of your argument, rectify grammatical and stylistic issues, diversify sentence structure, and better support your claims with descriptive arguments. These improvements will not only make your essay more informative but also more compelling and easier to follow for the reader.",3,4,3,4,1,1,1,3,2,1,Informative
4258,https://essayforum.com/writing/finacial-aid-practical-advice-75788/,test,Finacial Aid VS Practical Aid And Advice,"Nowadays, developing countries, especially those that are not affluent, are searching for financial aid from developed ones owing to economical increase. Nevertheless, I myself tend to think that it is somehow far better for those countries to ask for practical help and useful advices from international organizations. \n It has been a hot debate that the financial help is a suitable way for impoverished countries since it provides money as a solution for an array of issues. For instance, a country facing starvation can produce the number of people who are being killed by hunger by receiving money and apply food as well as clothing or a better condition for them to inhabit. However, everything has its own pros and cons. Receiving financial help is nothing but to raise your debt with the international organizations. In other words, financial help is just a short-term solution compared to practical help. \n Financial help has its massive good aspects that make it becomes prevalent, but in my opinion, advice and practical aid is outweighed in many ways. Although practical help is complicated to progress and need a long time to conduct, it is somehow a long-term solution for countries that are facing with poverty. It helps the government and also the civilians gaining the awareness of solving all the issues by themselves. For example, in Japan, everyone was taught to face with earthquake by a myriad of ways and to deal with the problem of recovering the city after that disaster. By doing this, both the government and the citizens get used to the catastrophe and their country still highly develop despite the frequently earthquake. \n In conclusion, the financial aid provides many merits but it is just a short-term solution to face with poverty. Governments should concentrate on advice and practical aid for a long-term solution one from international organizations, which somehow is a better way to get rid of poverty and difficulty developing countries are facing.","the paraphrasing and summary for your essay is faulty. While the original prompt indicates that you should indicate a discussion of the two sides, along with your own opinion, you did not do that in your representative statement. You merely offered a general discussion of the provided sides, in a single sentence, and then you immediately jumped into your personal opinion discussion. Which should not have been done in the opening statement. \n The essay should have followed the indicated presentation in the original instructions. So it should have been: \n 1. Opening summary \n 2. Side 1 \n 3. Side 2 \n 4. Personal opinion \n 5. Concluding summary \n By not following the proper discussion format, you ended up creating a personal opinion instead of a comparison discussion. As such, you adversely affected the possible score for your essay. That is because you showed a clear misunderstanding of the instructions and the discussion format. The only possible score in this instance is a 4.","Your essay brings up an important discussion about how developing countries can best be supported by more developed countries or international organizations. You suggest that practical aid and advice might be more beneficial than financial help. While this is an interesting viewpoint, there are several aspects of your essay that could be improved to make your argument stronger and clearer.

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: Your essay maintains a focus on the issue of aid to developing countries, which is good. However, for an even stronger response, ensure you comprehensively approach the topic by discussing both types of aid before clearly stating your stance. This way, readers can understand the full context of your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""advices"" should be ""advice"" (advice is uncountable in English), and ""becomes prevalent"" should be ""becomes prevalent."" Additionally, phrases like ""economical increase"" might better be expressed as ""economic growth."" Simplifying sentences and checking verb agreement will also help in making your essay clearer. To improve, consider reading your essay out loud or using a writing assistance tool to catch errors.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your viewpoint becomes clear towards the end of the essay, where you endorse practical aid over financial assistance. However, to strengthen your argument, your essay should start with an introduction that briefly outlines both perspectives before declaring your position. This structure will help readers understand your argument's context from the beginning.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: You provide examples to support your preference for practical aid, such as the reference to Japan’s disaster preparation and recovery efforts. To enhance your essay, consider also describing potential drawbacks of financial aid more concretely and comparing them directly with the benefits of practical aid. This detailed comparison will make your argument more persuasive.

To align more closely with the expectations for this essay, consider organizing your essay in the following way:
- **Introduction**: Summarize the debate on financial aid versus practical advice, stating that you will explore both before giving your opinion.
- **Body Paragraph 1**: Discuss the benefits and limitations of financial aid.
- **Body Paragraph 2**: Explore the advantages of practical aid, possibly drawing on more varied examples.
- **Personal Opinion**: Clearly outline why you believe practical aid is superior, backed by the arguments you’ve presented.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize your key points and restate your stance, emphasizing the long-term benefits of practical aid.

By following this structure, you clarify your position and create a compelling argument supported by evidence and examples. Remember, clarity and organization are just as important as the arguments themselves in making your essay persuasive and engaging.",3,4,4,4,2,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

While, the aim of the firm is to have profitability and they should only focus on this. Despite make money is essential for company, i tend to disagree in this point of view. \n Company always dealing on profit. It is mainly because as business the businessman have to earn a lot of money from company activities to operate their business and expand the production. For example, a businessman need much money to build the company and if it does not has profit enough, based on the business theory that is impossible as businessman can broaden their firm. As a result, without profit the firm overtime will collapse and get rid of from global market competition so focus on making money to keep exist the company is critical for company. \n However, in business operation many factors should be considered by company, because firm cannot survive if they only focus on making money. For illustrates, consumers go away from the product of the company because the firm does not consider about consumer need and costumer service or the rate of selling product decline caused by the company does not promote their product. In addition, the company can be banned by society if it does not care with public attention such as environment issue which is caused by factory activities so the firm should consider about others aspects such as marketing, costumer service, or corporate social responsibility beside profitability. \n To sum up, only focus on profitability is not best decision to company because to survive in global market competition the firm should consider many aspects.","in the opening statement, you accidentally created a hanging sentence instead of delivering a complete thought. Remove the word ""while"" in the second sentence so that you end up stating a fact instead of showing an incomplete thought process. Since you are presenting a personal point of view throughout the essay, make sure that you always take ownership of your opinion by using first person references such as ""I, my, me"" This will add to the strength and conviction of your statement / opinion throughout the essay. \n The flow of your discussion is logical and, although sometimes confusing, can be understood by the reader after a second reading. Your concluding statement is lacking in the major elements that would have made it successful. This includes a representation of the summarized discussion, reiteration of your opinion, and a closing sentence. If you review what you wrote, it is obvious that more information is required before the sentence can actually deliver a complete statement to the reader that can properly close the discussion.","Your essay offers an interesting perspective on the importance of balancing profitability with other aspects of business operations in the global market. Here are some specific points of feedback to help you improve your writing:

1. **Responsiveness to Topic**: You have successfully addressed the topic by discussing the centrality of profitability to companies while arguing that other factors should also be considered. Ensuring that your essay remains focused on the topic throughout is crucial. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few areas where spelling and grammar could be improved. For example, consider using ""a large number"" instead of ""large number"" for grammatical correctness. Use ""customer service"" instead of ""costumer service"" to correct a spelling error. Moreover, using the first person, such as ""I believe"" or ""In my opinion,"" would strengthen your argument by clearly presenting it as your viewpoint. As noted, the word ""while"" at the beginning of your essay hints at a comparison that isn't completed. Removing it will make your statement clearer.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view—that companies should not solely focus on profitability—is clear but could be expressed more strongly with the consistent use of the first person to take ownership of your opinions.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Your arguments, while informative, sometimes come across as a bit jumbled, making them hard for the reader to follow on the first pass. Try to structure your essay with clear, separate paragraphs for each main idea. For instance, one paragraph can focus on why profitability is essential, and another can discuss the importance of customer needs and social responsibility, each supported by specific examples or evidence.

5. **Conclusion**: The essay would benefit from a stronger concluding paragraph. Summarize your main points and reiterate your position clearly and concisely. This helps reinforce your argument and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of your perspective. Consider adding a sentence that offers a final, reflective thought on why a balance between profitability and other considerations is vital in the global market.

Remember, writing is a skill that gets better with practice. Focusing on clarity, structure, and grammar will significantly enhance the quality of your essays. Keep up the good work, and continue refining your arguments and writing style.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, living alone has both negative impacts and positive ones .This essay will consider these sides and draw some conclusions. \n On the one hand, there are some edges attracting the young to lead a unrestricted life. Firstly,it authorizes them to do many things at liberty. For instance, this trend Not only does this trend provide our possibility to pursue career without being driven to distraction by nurturing children or material needs ,it also offers chance to have dating with more partners. On the top of that,such a life can avert domestic violence due to financial burden or lack of close-knit in a family. It is easy to imagine how that mode can improve the quality of life. \n On the other hand,we almost express apprehension about how a sole life has negative effects on the young. In the short term,it is likely that we will see a rise in loneliness. For example, a scene that we can visualize is that they find themselves in a room without encouragement but with the stressful, bumming out and even being shaken up. A long-term fear is that it will be challenged if young people are about to be a single-partent.","<quotation>This essay will consider these sides and draw some conclusions.</quotation> \n You have failed the essay in terms of restatement considerations at this point.

There is no requirement presented for the writer to draw conclusions about the 2 sides. \n <quotation>In conclusions,while leading a single life ... given enough attention.</quotation> \n The conclusion will be another reason for the essay's low score. This time, the same errors in the paraphrasing were made in the summary conclusion. \n The comparison paragraphs are well developed and explained. These are supportive of the original discussion requirement. However, the esor in the restatements are what will score down the final mark.The student must make an effort to not alter the discussion rephrasing next time.","The essay provides a balanced view on the topic of choosing to live a single life, discussing both advantages and disadvantages. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the overall quality and clarity of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay addresses the comparison between the advantages and disadvantages of living a single life, which aligns with the prompt's requirement for a discussion. However, it goes beyond the prompt's scope by hinting at drawing definitive conclusions. Focusing solely on comparing the two sides without implying the need to draw a conclusion would more accurately fulfill the requirement. It's important to closely adhere to the prompt's instructions.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are a few issues that need attention. For instance, the essay contains spelling errors (e.g., ""cirlce"" should be ""circle""), punctuation misplacements (e.g., spacing issues around commas), and some awkward phrasing (""get cold feet to tie a knot"" could be simplified to ""hesitate to marry""). Additionally, the use of phrases like ""on the top of that"" is less formal; consider using ""moreover"" or ""furthermore"" for a more academic tone. Ensuring correct spelling, proper grammar, and a consistent style will make the essay easier to read and more professional.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** While the essay does present a personal viewpoint on the issue, making this perspective clear from the beginning can strengthen the argument. For instance, rather than saying, ""This essay will consider these sides and draw some conclusions,"" a more direct approach like ""I believe living alone has both advantages and disadvantages"" can firmly establish the personal viewpoint.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** The essay successfully outlines reasons for both the positive and negative aspects of living alone, providing examples to support each point made. This is a strength of the essay. To further improve, consider developing these arguments with more detailed examples or evidence. For example, instead of broadly mentioning ""improve the quality of life,"" specify what aspects of life quality are improved, such as personal freedom, career advancement, or mental health.

Finally, while the comparison paragraphs are well-developed, pay careful attention to not alter the phrasing of the discussion from the prompt. The aim is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages without necessarily concluding which is more significant. It's valuable to remain focused on analyzing the comparison to meet the essay's requirements fully.

By addressing these areas—staying true to the prompt, refining the language, clearly stating the personal viewpoint, and bolstering arguments with specific details—the essay would not only become stronger and more persuasive but also closer aligned with the expectations of an English proficiency test essay.",3,4,4,3,3,3,2,3,4,1,Argumentative

The government and the people are what we call strong in numbers because they gather to help and trust each other, and by doing that, it makes them stronger. This is why people, or us, should come together and unite as one. \n We maintain peace and stability in unity. Peace and stability are pivotal to our unity because they help us prevent conflicts and show everyone's participation in particular social activities. We should always maintain peace and stability to avoid conflict that will arise in a physical quarrel. \n Growth and development are also crucial to our oneness. It improves ourselves and our community; it makes our lives easier and more manageable; and it can also avoid the occurrence of social problems like poverty. Growth and development can apply to various things, such as government. If our country has good governance and if people have a good mindset and knowledge, the country will accelerate its growth and development. Growth and development are important because they help us avoid the occurrence of social problems. \n In summary, being one and maintaining peace, stability, growth, and development can improve our country, our society, and our government.

However, there are several areas where improvements could make your arguments clearer and more compelling. 

Firstly, your opening statement, ""Standing as one is better than one,"" may confuse readers because it lacks clarity about what you're comparing. A more precise way to communicate this idea might be, ""Standing together is better than standing alone,"" which directly contrasts unity with solitude, reinforcing your main argument.

Concerning your discussion on peace and stability, it's essential to convey that unity doesn't solely prevent physical conflict but also fosters a shared understanding and respect for diverse opinions. The phrase ""avoid conflict that will arise in a physical quarrel"" could be rephrased to emphasize the broader benefits of unity in preventing misunderstandings and disagreements, not just physical altercations. Consider saying, ""Unity helps us navigate disagreements and maintain harmony,"" which encompasses a wider range of positive outcomes from collective cohesion.

The reference to the government as a unifying entity might not resonate with all readers since people often have varying views on governmental roles in society. To ensure your message is universally relatable, you might focus on grassroots unity among citizens, neighbors, and community members, illustrating how local collaboration fosters a strong, cohesive society.

Additional points for improvement include refining your essay for spelling, grammar, and stylistic consistency to enhance readability. For instance, maintaining a consistent tense and perspective throughout will make your argument more coherent. Also, your essay could benefit from specific examples that illustrate your points, making the concept of unity more tangible to the reader. For example, when discussing growth and development, mention a specific instance where community unity led to positive change.

To summarize, your essay presents a compelling argument for the value of unity. By clarifying your opening statement, broadening the discussion on peace and stability, focusing on community rather than governmental unity, and polishing your language and structure, your essay will be even more persuasive and effective.

It has resulted in a downward good physical condition for most people. Some causes of these problems are related to the eating habits of people. The situation can be resolved by placing higher taxes on unhealthy foods.</em> \n Now, the original prompt is asking for plural discussions in relation to the problems and solutions presented. You are only presenting one problem and one solution in your presentation. You should be discussing at least 2 of each in a related manner, within one paragraph.

The focus on increased taxation of fast food and support for organic options is a valuable standpoint. However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness, clarity, and adherence to the topic.

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay attempts to align with the assigned topic but tends to simplify the presentation by highlighting a singular problem and solution. While the concern over unhealthy eating habits and their health implications is relevant, your essay could benefit from exploring additional related problems and varied solutions. Incorporating at least two problems and respective solutions within your discussion would provide a more comprehensive view and satisfy the requirements more thoroughly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are noticeable spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow and clarity of your writing. For instance, phrases like ""Eating habit in many nations are the key factors of citizenry who are getting heavier"" could be better structured as ""Eating habits in many nations are key factors leading to an increase in obesity among citizens."" Consider focusing on sentence development and expanding your vocabulary through reading and exercises to form coherent and correct sentences. This practice will help in expressing your ideas more clearly and effectively.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** While your essay presents a stance on the issue, the arguments tend to lack cohesion and clarity. Strengthening your sentence structure and ensuring proper use of English words can significantly improve how your point of view is conveyed. Avoid presenting questions in the middle of your essay, as it might divert focus from your main discussion.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** Your essay includes examples and potential solutions, yet these points need to be described more vividly and connected logically. Ensuring that arguments are detailed and directly support your position will make your reasoning more persuasive and comprehensible to the reader.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to more effectively respond to the essay prompt and communicate your ideas.

**1. Relevance to the Topic:**
The primary issue with the essay is that it deviates from the central topic. The initial prompt focuses on the importance and necessity of parenting courses, but the essay expands the discussion to include divorce rates among young couples and promiscuity, which diverts attention from the main question about parenting courses. To improve, ensure that your essay directly addresses the question by focusing on why parenting courses are important and how they can contribute to the better upbringing of children. 

**2. Clarity and Precision in Language:**
The essay has multiple spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that make it challenging to understand. For instance, the term ""fossils"" seems to be used incorrectly, likely intending to mean ""couples"" or ""parents"". Additionally, ""graybeard"" and ""oldsters"" are not appropriately used in the context you're trying to convey. Improving your language clarity will significantly enhance your essay's comprehensibility. Consider using straightforward language and ensuring your terms and phrases accurately reflect what you mean.

**3. Point of View and Argumentation:**
Your viewpoint appears to be that parenting courses are beneficial, especially for young parents. However, the arguments presented in support of this view are not always clear or directly linked to the benefits of parenting courses. It's vital to present clear, descriptive arguments that directly support your standpoint. For example, instead of discussing the consequences of young marriage, focus on how parenting courses can prepare young parents by providing them with necessary skills and knowledge.

**4. Specific and Actionable Suggestions:**
To enhance your essay, concentrate on organizing your thoughts more coherently around the thesis that parenting courses are essential. Offer specific examples or scenarios where these courses could have a positive impact. Each paragraph should introduce a new idea that supports your main thesis, avoiding unrelated topics.

**In Conclusion:**
Simplifying language, maintaining topic relevance, enhancing argument clarity, and offering specific examples will make your essay stronger and more focused. Revising with these points in mind will not only make your essay more coherent but also ensure that it accurately addresses the prompt.

While some agree with this statement, others argue that public service should be optional. In my final analysis, I am in favor of the latter view. \n On the one hand, doing public service in free time may offer some main benefits. Firstly, for individuals, taking part in community service can enhance teenagers' social skills such as planning, money management, and time management. Furthermore, new relationships can be built as people often work in different groups for these services. Secondly, for society, participating in such services can enhance the average standard of living. For example, by introducing such environmental campaigns in many schools in Vietnam, a great quantity of litter has been collected by teenagers across the country. As a result, this method has raised students' awareness about protecting the environment, and air quality in many provinces has improved. \n On the other hand, despite having many benefits, I assert that unpaid work should not be mandatory for adolescents. It cannot be denied that these days, students are becoming busier with a huge amount of workload, so they may not have enough leisure time. Therefore, if they are required to do the community service in their free time, they will not have enough time for studying and relaxing. This can lead to adverse effects on their grades as well as their physical and mental health. In addition, public service should be optional, so teenagers could strike a balance between study and extracurricular activities. Another reason for this might be that when children have the ability to choose their appropriate type of community service, they could have the potential to develop their skills. \n In conclusion, I firmly believe that public service should be done by volunteers. Although this has significant advantages for individuals and society as a whole, I assert that we should not make it obligatory.","The writers opinion is clear in the first paragraph.

By using the comparison discussion format, you have failed to support your opinion. As such, your final score will be based on an under developed discussion presentation, which may be a failing score depending upon what sort of score you will receive for the remaining scoring sections.

The stance is made clear from the beginning, which is a strength of this essay. However, to enhance the clarity and impact of the argument, the essay would benefit from a more focused approach that consistently supports the author's final view throughout.

1. **Alignment with Topic and Structure**: The essay directly addresses the topic, which is commendable. However, it's important to maintain a consistent argument that aligns with the chosen stance. Instead of presenting both sides of the argument equally, aim to provide stronger, more detailed support for the view that community service should be optional. This will make the argument more persuasive and focused.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is well-written with minimal spelling and grammatical errors. To enhance readability and engagement, consider varying sentence structure and using more transitional phrases to smoothly link ideas and sections. This will also help in making the essay's structure and progression clearer to the reader.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The initial declaration of the author's viewpoint is clear, which is a good practice. However, the subsequent discussion introduces conflicting perspectives without adequately reinforcing the author's own stance. To improve, ensure that each paragraph clearly contributes to and strengthens the author's position. Avoid presenting contrasting arguments without clearly explaining how they support your main viewpoint.

4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay presents arguments on both sides, it's crucial for an opinion essay to predominantly develop arguments supporting the author's view. Please focus on elaborating two or more strong reasons or pieces of evidence that firmly back your stance. For instance, instead of equally discussing the benefits of compulsory community service, emphasize more on why making it optional is beneficial, integrating examples or hypothetical scenarios that illustrate your points more vividly.

5. **Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph does well to summarize the essay's main points and reaffirm the author's position. For further improvement, make sure the conclusion also succinctly addresses why the opposing arguments were considered less convincing, thereby reinforcing the chosen stance effectively.

Remember, the key to a compelling argumentative essay is in presenting a clear, consistent viewpoint backed by coherent, well-developed arguments. Focusing on these areas will significantly enhance the persuasive power of your writing.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Work in factories that take ages to complete, now are matter of seconds. One field of technology known as robotics are becoming the major source of productivity in industries. \n As robots are becoming reality nowadays, some employers and employees think that such advance technology has helped them significantly. As robots started handling dangerous and unpleasant jobs, the amount of risk and pressure onto humans has drastically reduced. Tasks which needed many helping hands, is solely done by one machine and at a better pace. All out of it, employers are the ones who are getting bigger slice of the cake. These machines are about to give maximum input and much lesser rate. \n On the contrary, some employers think that these machines are robbing them of their livelihood. They fear that employers will prefer robots over them in days to come. At some point i do agree to their predication. As robots are able to perform at better pace and their efficiency is much higher than humans, they may take over some work that were assigned to humans. But according to me, they cannot outgrow the human mind. \n Robots need instructions to do a particular task, and theses can be only given by humans. Like children, robots also need adult supervision to do a task in an efficient manner. They still fail to interpret problems and adapt to conditions, in which humans are masters. Robots can do only certain jobs and they do not have the power to adjust according to the current situation . Humans on the other hand are able to perform well even if they have to mood themselves for some time. They are flexible and think of different ways to Doha particular job. \n Overall, robots are efficient machines, but their efficiency is limited to certain extend. Whereas humans being their creators always have an upper hand on them. It can either be in terms of supervision or making changes related to the present needs.","Dear student, this was a pretty well developed analytical essay of a given topic. The essay had a bump in its otherwise flawless presentation when you said; ""According to me..."". Since the phrase indicates that someone else is giving you this information that you are presenting, you cannot use that term. You cannot quote yourself. The phrase actually indicates the beginning of a quote in a sentence, so it is improperly used in your essay. The best phrase to have used to refer to what you were thinking was either ""In my opinion"" or ""As far as I am concerned"" or perhaps, ""Based upon my understanding"". These are some of the variations you could have used to indicate that you were stating a personal point of view at that point in the essay. No matter though. The work you did is above average in terms of representing the discussion question and the various considerations in terms of the success of robots taking over human jobs in the future. Good work. I hope you can continue to improve your writing skills. Your grammar and sentence structure problems are minimal at this point. In fact, these could be considered negligible because your paragraphs are well developed and easily understood, even with the existing problems. There was no impediment present that would have made it difficult to understand what you were saying.","This essay provides a well-developed analysis of the impact of robotics on employment, effectively discussing both the benefits and potential drawbacks of technological advancements in the workplace. The essay is responsive to the topic, presenting clear arguments that weigh the efficiency of robots against the irreplaceable value of human creativity and adaptability. 

However, there are a few areas where the essay could be improved to enhance clarity, correctness, and overall impact:

1. **Point of View and Expression**: When expressing personal opinions, the phrase ""according to me"" can seem unusual, as it may imply that the information or viewpoint is coming from another source. Instead, using expressions like ""In my opinion,"" ""As far as I am concerned,"" or ""Based upon my understanding"" can clearly indicate a personal point of view without confusion. This helps maintain the authoritativeness of your voice throughout the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay's grammar and sentence structure are generally good, there are minor errors and opportunities for stylistic improvements. For example, carefully proofreading to catch and correct spelling errors, ensuring subject-verb agreement, and avoiding repetitive phrases can make the writing more polished and professional. Also, varying sentence structure and using transitions between paragraphs will enhance the flow of the essay and make it more engaging for the reader.

3. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: The essay does a commendable job of presenting arguments for both the efficiency of robots and the unique capabilities of humans. To further strengthen these arguments, including specific examples or more detailed explanations can provide clearer support for the author's position. For instance, discussing real-world scenarios where robots have improved productivity or cases where human adaptability made a critical difference could make the arguments more compelling and descriptive.

4. **Perspective on Technological Advancement**: The essay acknowledges the complexity of technological advancement, noting both its potential to enhance productivity and the fear it instills regarding job security. This nuanced view is a strength of the essay. Continuing to explore these themes with depth, acknowledging the ongoing evolution of technology, and considering potential solutions for balancing technological efficiency with human employment could add further richness to the discussion.

In conclusion, the essay is effective in addressing the topic and provides a balanced view of the role of robotics in the workplace. By refining the expression of personal opinions, making slight improvements to grammar and style, and further developing arguments with specific examples, the essay could be enhanced to more powerfully convey its message.

First of all,every kind of animals has their lives like human beings and the lives are meaningful. Secondly,the whole animals constitute our nature environment which we vastly depend on. We will go nowhere without nature environment .Perhaps, we would lose all resources such as water,oil,electricity and so on which we must use every single day. Thirdly,in nature ,there always have rules---food chain. It means every animal have their stationary foods that can not change. If one kind of animals is extinct ,the other animal which feed on them definitely go to death. All wild animals would disappear when that happens. Then human beings probably would not exist. \n Others brlieve it in different way. Usually,our country do not have enough money to support to all wild animals .Therefore ,we have no choice to prevent part of them from dangerous. Moreover,part of them are born with so strong vitality that they can protect by themselves. Besides that ,they have plenty of companions which means they are far from extinction. What's more important ,in normal cases,we do invest much money in protecting them,but the outcome is inefficient.

You are required to always post the prompt along with your response. Without that, all you can get from me is a generalized comment as to your format and development issues. \n The first problem of your essay is connected to the missing prompt requirement. You offer a one liner as your opening statement. Definitely the best way to fail this test. You must offer up a concrete restatement of the prompt / topic for discussion as provided to you. This means, you need to convince the examiner that you really understood what the discussion is about and how you are to discuss it. Accomplish this in at least 3 sentences, as most opening statements normally require only that number of sentences to get the summary across. \n Next, you group together 3 discussion topics in one paragraph. Another major failure on the part of the writer. The Cohesiveness and Coherence of your essay depends upon your ability to form complete paragraphs based on single topics per paragraph. Right now, you have given us an overview of reasons but you have not fully explained these reasons to the reader so these reasons become invalid. Without a proper paragraph presentation for each one, you are not capable of fully justifying each reference that you have made.

The requirement for the closing paragraph is the same as the opening statement only with the addition of the discussion points this time around.","Your essay attempts to address an important and complex issue: the protection of wild animals. However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to enhance the strength and clarity of your argument. Let's go through some specific points that will help you refine your essay.

1. **Understanding and Responding to the Topic:**
   - Your essay lacked a clear restatement of the prompt or question you are responding to. It's crucial to start your essay by clearly stating the question or topic you're discussing. This not only shows that you understand the subject but also sets the stage for your argument. A well-defined introduction with at least three sentences summarizing the topic can significantly improve the reader's comprehension and engagement.

2. **Organization and Development:**
   - Your essay combines multiple arguments in a single paragraph, which can confuse readers. To enhance the cohesiveness and coherence of your essay, dedicate each paragraph to a single point or argument. This organization will allow you to delve deeper into each argument, providing detailed explanations and examples. By doing so, you're not only clarifying your stance but also making it easier for readers to follow your line of reasoning.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   - There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""brlieve"" should be ""believe"") and grammatical errors in your essay. Additionally, the essay would benefit from greater attention to punctuation, such as using spaces after commas and periods. Improving spelling and grammar and adhering to stylistic norms can greatly enhance the clarity and professionalism of your writing.

4. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:**
   - While you've attempted to present both sides of the argument, your own point of view becomes clear only towards the end of the essay. It could be helpful to state your perspective more clearly in the introduction and then reinforce it throughout the essay, leading to a more persuasive and cohesive piece.

5. **Arguments and Descriptions:**
   - While you present several arguments for and against the protection of all wild animals, these need to be more fully developed. Providing specific examples or evidence to support your claims can strengthen your arguments. Additionally, exploring the implications of these arguments in more depth will add to the persuasiveness of your essay.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion falls short of effectively summarizing the discussion points. An impactful conclusion restates the main arguments discussed and reinforces the author's point of view, tying the essay together. Make sure your conclusion is comprehensive enough to cover these aspects.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly improve the structure, clarity, and persuasiveness of your essay. Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice, so keep working at it!",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"From democratic point of view, every person have the right to express his opinion. The best way to express opinion in such a government system is to enfranchise. Children who are above 15 years of age are not beyond this right. Personally, I believe that people who has the sense of right or wrong and has the ability to take decision even if he is below 18 (typical age for being considered as adult) but above 15 years of age should have the right to vote. \n Eventhough some people might argue saying people who are below 18 years are still termed 'children' and hence, they should not be allowed to vote, I think as because they are termed so-called 'children' they can't be deprived of their rights of voting. The term 'children' and 'adult' is defined not only on the basis of biological aspect but also considering the social aspect. Now, the aspect of society is again depends on so many things and that's why society varies around the world. If I just focus on the biological perspective, a person who is capable of reproduction can be termed as 'adult'. In most of the cases people including both male and female achieve this ability of reproduction by the age of 15. So, at this age they are adult enough and therefore, they have the right to express their opinion through voting. \n Moreover, voting means expressing one's choice and taking his or her own decision. I don't think age can be a limiting factor in taking decision. Sometimes it can be seen that older people are taking wrong decision, on the other hand, a very younger people whom we call 'children' are taking right decision. So, if so-called 'children' can take decision, she or he has all the rights to express it in terms of casting vote. \n In conclusion, voting is a right of a citizen that depends on the ability of taking decision. One who has achieved this ability, regardless of age, she or he should be awarded the right to vote and express their opinion.","Dear student, based on your work for this essay prompt, I believe the best score you can get is a 2. That rating is based on the lack of clarity in your explanation, confusing opinions, and irrelevant examples. You never did say whether or not you agreed or disagreed with the statement indicated in the prompt. While you did say that you believe anyone over the age of 15 should be allowed to vote, you also said in your actual discussion that people at the age of 15 should be given the right to vote since you implied that they can already get pregnant at that age. You should have clearly stated ""I disagree/agree with the given statement"". Unfortunately, your response was neither here nor there in position. So your essay ended up without a real discussion point in the presentation. \n You also have a misconception that ""children"" fall under the age of 15. A 15 year old is a teenager, a young adult. Definitely not a ""child"" so your discussion that insists a 15 year old is a child is flawed and unacceptable in this discussion. A 15 year old is already allowed to make simple to semi-complex decisions for themselves. So the question becomes, can a 15 year old be allowed to vote ? Do you think he understands the reasons why he has to vote and how to choose the side of the discussion or candidate to support? \n You show a lack of familiarity with English reference terms in this instance, which means you did not really understand the question and its applicability to a discussion either. These are the reasons why I could not score you higher than a 2 for this essay discussion.","The essay examines the topic of whether individuals above 15 years of age should be granted the right to vote. It is crucial to address both the strengths and areas for improvement in the essay to guide the author towards enhancing their writing skills.

**Response to Topic:**
The essay does attempt to align with the topic by advocating for voting rights for individuals aged 15 and above. However, the stance is not clearly stated as an agreement or disagreement with a specific statement. For a stronger essay, explicitly stating ""I agree"" or ""I disagree"" with a clear topic at the beginning can clarify the position for the reader right away.

**Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
The essay includes several grammatical errors. For example, ""every person have the right"" should be ""every person has the right"". Attention to subject-verb agreement is crucial. Also, the use of ""Eventhough"" should be two separate words: ""Even though"". Additionally, improving the use of plural and singular nouns will enhance clarity. To make the essay easier to follow, consider introducing paragraphs with topic sentences that guide the reader through your argument, ensuring each paragraph focuses on a single main idea.

**Clarity of Author's Point of View:**
The essay's point of view is somewhat clear, expressing a belief in voting rights for younger individuals. However, the justification for this point of view sometimes gets lost in complex and unclear arguments. Simplifying the explanation and focusing on key arguments will make the point of view stronger. For example, rather than arguing from a biological perspective alone, discussing social maturity and civic understanding could bolster the argument.

**Arguments and Support:**
The essay's arguments hinge largely on biological maturity and the capacity to make decisions. However, these points could be strengthened with clearer reasoning and support. The classification of a 15-year-old as a child or adult is debated, but the essay should articulate why being able to make decisions (including reproductive maturity) directly translates to readiness to vote. Including discussions on civic education, understanding of political systems, and examples of decision-making could provide stronger support for the argument.

**Additional Notes:**
It's important to use accurate terminology. The essay refers to 15-year-olds broadly as ""children,"" which can be misleading since this age is often considered early adolescence. Clarifying the terms used and focusing on the characteristics that define their capacity for voting would enhance the argument's clarity.

**In Summary:**
To improve your essay, clearly state your position from the beginning, address grammatical and stylistic errors, simplify your arguments for clarity, and support your points with logical reasoning. Consider what makes someone ready to vote beyond age or biological maturity, such as understanding political issues and making informed decisions. Focusing on these aspects can strengthen your essay significantly.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument.,"The argument that the decrease in attendance at city's art museum results from corporate funding on public television omits some important concerns that must be addressed to substantiate the argument. When the corporate funding is threatened, the author anticipates the down-ward trend of visitors and proposes the method of reallocating fund to public television. This alone does not constitute a logical argument in favor of rising participants in city's art museum and it certainly does not provide support or proof of the main argument. \n To begin with, the author shows a close correlation between people viewing visual arts programs on television and people visiting art museums. This comparison is invalid. There is no evidence that the sample of participants surveyed on television program is the same like that in real museums. Those who attend the arts museum may not watch arts museum program before. And those who view television also may not visit the museum. Due to this reason, the above hypothesis makes the conclusion problematic. \n Secondly, there are many ways to improve the revenue of arts museum, not just the sole solution of reallocating fund to public television. The author does not present any proof of decreased attendance of museum due to limited investment in television programs. It is just anticipation. In order to attract many visitors to arts museum, services should be developed and interesting activities can be advertised on the Internet instead of only living art shows on television. Because of these reasons, the given method is not persuasive. \n Finally, according to statement given, the funding supporting visual programs comes from corporate parties, whereas state or non-profit organizations are not mentioned. The severe cut on corporate funding may not be large enough to affect the art broadcast. The author lacks a general view of current matter and just focus on only aspect of that. It puts forwards to an unconvincing assumption. \n Because the argument leaves out several key issues, it is not sound or persuasive. If it included the items discussed above instead of solely suggesting a solution based on flawed reasons, the argument would have been more thorough and convincing.","Dear student, I know that the GMAT essays as scored in increments. However, I would rather just use the baseline scoring system for your work because I am not privy to the other considerations that the professional reviewers have when considering the final essay score. In my honest opinion, I believe that your essay would score with a baseline score of 3 but still lower than a 4. That is because the essay you developed has certain marked flaws that showed a problem in your ability to review the instant information that was delivered to you. What are your major problem points? \n For starters, you have to remember to use all of the key points that are delivered for your use in the prompt. In this instance, you were provided with actual figures regarding the attendance at museums and yet, you failed to properly utilize that information in the essay. The constant use of unsubstantiated references in your own discussion, while the references ti support some of your claims existed in the original discussion presentation is one of the weakest points of your analysis. \n Due to the weak analysis of the data provided, you were limited in your ability to develop a logical and organized method of presenting your ideas. This led to opinions and analysis that had little value in the overall consideration of your discussion. Adding the problems with sentence structure and variety further lowered the accuracy of your discussion. There were also issues regarding the grammar use in the essay. For example, using the term ""living art shows"" when you meant ""watching art shows"" changes the meaning of the sentence and the logic behind your statement.","**Final Feedback on the Essay:**

The essay attempts to critique the argument that the decrease in attendance at the city's art museum is a direct result of corporate funding on public television. This response shows a good starting point by questioning the logic behind the original argument. However, the essay can be improved in several areas to enhance clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Relevance to the Topic:** The essay correctly identifies the need to challenge the argument presented but fails to address all the components of the original prompt effectively. It is important to use all the available information from the prompt, such as any figures or specific examples provided, to strengthen the critique. There seems to be a missed opportunity to utilize specific data that could have been used to support or refute points made in your essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** Several sentences in the essay could benefit from closer attention to sentence structure and word choice. For example, the phrase ""living art shows"" might be confusing and might not convey the intended meaning clearly. Is the intention to say ""live art shows"" or ""watching art shows on television""? Precision in language is crucial for clear communication. Additionally, watch out for run-on sentences or overly complicated sentences that might make the essay hard to follow.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** While the essay attempts to present a critique, it's occasionally unclear due to the lack of strong supporting arguments and examples. To make the point of view more apparent, identify clear arguments backed up by data or logical reasoning. For instance, when questioning the correlation between television viewing and museum attendance, providing evidence or suggesting potential studies could strengthen the argument.

4. **Descriptive and Supportive Arguments:** The essay mentions several critical viewpoints but often lacks depth in the explanations or alternatives offered. For example, suggesting improvements for museum revenue is an excellent start, but it would be more compelling with specific examples or references to successful strategies from other museums. This would not only show a broader understanding of the subject but also provide tangible solutions.

To improve the essay, consider these steps:
- Revisit the original prompt and ensure all aspects are thoroughly addressed.
- Review grammar and syntax to improve readability and accuracy.
- Establish a clear stance on the issue and support it with concrete examples or data.
- Expand on suggestions for alternatives by adding more detail and justification for why they could be effective.

Remember, a strong essay is not just about critiquing an argument but also about offering a well-supported alternative perspective. Aim to be concise but thorough in your explanations, and always back up your points with logical reasoning or evidence.",4,4,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1,Analytical

In either case, everyone faces different kinds of challenges in life and I believe it depends on the people how they are going to adapt and manage the situation to overcome all the obstacles they may experience in life. \n This is what I have learned recently as a mom. Saying to a child that he/she is fortunate to live a life without problems is not ideal. Because of the fact that children at a very young age also experience different kinds of difficulties such as: not getting enough attention, not being able to express themselves, not getting what they want, and so on. In this case, parents are supposed to address and help the children overcome these hardships and the best way to do this is to bring out something positive about the situation. \n People are made uniquely individuals. I believe that each person is purposely made differently because each one of us has different kinds of roles in this world. Sometime last week, I came across this video of a woman who was interviewed for mother's day. She was sharing all the hardships that she faced in her life. There is one line that she said that really stuck to me. She said, ""God gave her obstacles not because He is punishing her but to prepare her for the greater things that she will receive."" In her interview she said at the end, she realized that all the hardship she experienced helped her to become a better person for herself and for her children. \n Everything that we do is based on our choices and if we want to turn every obstacle, challenge, or negative thing that happens to us into a positive, then we must work on our personality, mental health, and mindset.

1. **Relevance to the Topic:** Your essay aligns well with the theme of facing and overcoming challenges. Your viewpoints are clear and supported by personal experiences, which strengthens your argument.

2. **Conciseness and Clarity:** While it's commendable to offer detailed insights, it's also essential to be concise, especially in a timed exam setting. The essay contains 360 words, which might be more than necessary. Aim to express your thoughts more succinctly.

3. **Use of Language and Style:** There are a few areas where simpler language could benefit the overall clarity of your message. Remember, the goal is to communicate your ideas as clearly and directly as possible. Avoid overly complex sentences or ideas that might confuse the reader or detract from your main points.

4. **Religious References:** While sharing personal beliefs can add a unique dimension to your essay, it's advisable to avoid specific religious references, as these can be seen as controversial or off-topic in a general examination setting. Your essay should aim to be universally understandable and relatable, regardless of the reader's personal beliefs.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Your essay is generally well-written but could benefit from a thorough proofreading session to catch minor errors and ensure grammatical correctness. Paying close attention to these details can significantly improve the overall quality of your essay.

6. **Clarity of Viewpoint:** Your perspective is clear throughout the essay, which is excellent. However, emphasizing how each argument supports your viewpoint without diverging into tangents will make your position even stronger.

7. **Descriptive Arguments:** You've done a commendable job of using personal experiences to support your viewpoints. To further strengthen your arguments, consider directly linking your experiences to broader life lessons or observations that can be applied universally.

Do not use these 2 references going forward as the task 2 essays are formal and academic papers. Good work in the reasoning paragraphs though. The discussion is well supported and uses ample transition words. \n <quotation>Unless we prevent</quotation> \n <quotation>we must face</quotation> \n The first reference implies we have yet to prevent climate change . The second reference makes it appear that we are compelled to face something. This is a sentence structure error. As we are currently dealing with the effects you pointed out, statement should reflect that. The more appropriate structure is ""...we will continue to face... "". This indicates the current effects we are trying to change /alter. \n The concluding statement is too short a summary presentation. Use at least 2 sentences. One for the topic and one or 2 more for the reasoning topic quick versions.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by presenting a clear argument against simply adapting to climate change and advocating for active measures to combat it. The stance is clear and asserts that both governments and individuals play essential roles in addressing this global issue.

However, there are areas for improvement in terms of formality and clarity, which would enhance the academic tone of the essay. Phrases like ""so on"" and ""etc."" are informal and should be avoided in academic writing. Instead, try to either list specific examples fully or rephrase to avoid the need for such terms. This change would elevate the formality of your essay and make your arguments appear more deliberate and considered.

The sentence beginning with ""Unless we prevent"" followed by ""we must face"" could be clearer. It currently suggests we haven't started facing the impacts of climate change yet. A more accurate representation of your argument would be to use phrases that acknowledge ongoing challenges, such as ""as we continue to face."" This change emphasizes the ongoing nature of climate change impacts and the urgency of addressing them.

The concluding paragraph provides a succinct summary but could be expanded to enhance its effectiveness. A stronger conclusion would restate the central argument of combating rather than adapting to climate change, followed by a brief recap of the main reasons supporting this stance. This could make your conclusion more impactful and leave the reader with a clearer understanding of your position and the evidence backing it.

The use of transition words and the structure of the essay successfully guide the reader through your arguments, showcasing your ability to logically support your viewpoint. Your discussion on the diverse measures to tackle climate change, from renewable energy sources to promoting public transportation, is well articulated and backed by clear reasoning.

To further improve your essay, consider providing more detail in some areas to strengthen your arguments. For example, elaborating on how renewable energy sources specifically contribute to reducing climate change could make your argument more persuasive.

In summary, the essay effectively conveys a clear viewpoint and is supported by relevant arguments. By making slight adjustments to the use of informal phrases, clarifying sentence structures, and expanding the concluding paragraph, the essay can attain a more academic tone and achieve greater clarity in its arguments.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Others think that people should have freedom to buid houses of their own style. Do you agree or disagree with this view?,"Opinions diverge greatly on whether or not newly errected buildings are forced to retain the similar architecture with the previous one. From my perspective, I would contend that house owners should feel free to design their accommodations in their own way. \n It is unequal for architects to obey the same style for quarters in a region. Copying merchanically ways of construction might be associated with obstructing their creative ability. This may be explained by the fact that designing a house is still considered as a genre of art which enables builders and designers to show off their asthetic capabilities. This means that each architect has their own method and distictly different criteria in assessing a quarter as being well-appointed. For instant, some tend to take a keen interest in blending between tradditional and modern styles while vintage designed housing becomes more favourable for others. \n Another reason for this is that following the same architecture might be attributed to a monotonous and dull picture for the area. In fact, what new accommodation are formulated to look indifferent with the old one disregard the appearance element. The beauty of the way housing being constructed, conversely, becomes one of the appealing part in visitors'eyes when they set their foot to the local area. This is because something outstanding and special seems to leave unforgetable memory. \n From all existing justification mentioned above, I am firmly of the opinion that imitating the housing trend might be superficial on account of the architect's creativity hinderance and tediousness in design.","I will just analyze it for problems and corrections. That way you will know what to improve with your second essay, which I will then score. I am afraid that you will not score very well with this essay if I were to assign a band consideration to it. There is a very strong possibility that this essay will receive a failing score due to its improper / incorrect discussion topic and format. It appears from what you wrote that you changed the discussion instruction for the discussion from: \n <em>Do you agree or disagree with this view?</em> \n to \n <em>I would contend that house owners should feel free to design their accommodations in their own way.</em> \n As you can can see, you are airing a personal opinion without considering the proper discussion response which is supposed to be: \n <em>From my personal perspective, I would have to dis/agree with this view.</em> \n The main problem though, is that I believe you did not post the correct discussion instruction for this essay. Can you double check to be sure that you followed the correct discussion instruction? Based on the given discussion topic and reasons, it appears that this is a ""discuss both points of view and present your own opinion"" or ""Discuss your opinion"" essay. It is not an agree/disagree essay prompt. \n If I were to base your score on the assumed prompt, then you did not discuss the essay within expected parameters so you will get a failing score in the TA section and another failing score for the repeated spelling mistakes in the essay. Both of which will combine to make you fail the essay in totality.","Reflecting on your essay regarding whether new buildings should maintain similar architecture to existing ones, it's clear you've put effort into articulating your thoughts. However, there are several aspects that could enhance your essay's effectiveness and clarity, ensuring it fully addresses the topic and presents your arguments cohesively.

Firstly, your essay slightly deviates from the expected response format. The prompt likely sought an examination of both perspectives before stating your personal stance explicitly as either agreeing or disagreeing with a given view. Your approach, focusing mainly on advocating for architectural diversity and creativity, omits a balanced discussion. For future essays, carefully restate the question in your introduction and ensure you directly address it throughout your essay, providing a more balanced view before concluding with your stance.

Your essay exhibits spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""errected"" (correct spelling: erected) and ""asthetic"" (correct spelling: aesthetic), alongside phrasing that could be streamlined for clarity (""merchanically"" might be better as ""mechanically""). Regular proofreading and use of spellcheck tools or asking someone to review your work can significantly reduce these mistakes.

Stylistically, simplifying your language could enhance the readability of your essay. While your vocabulary is commendably broad, ensuring your audience can effortlessly understand your message is paramount. For instance, the sentence ""This may be explained by the fact that designing a house is still considered as a genre of art"" could be simplified to ""Designing a house is seen as a form of art.""

Your viewpoint is evident, yet the essay would benefit from more explicit and varied arguments supporting your view. While you mention the hindrance to creativity and the risk of monotony, expanding on potential benefits of diverse architectural styles, like cultural expression or environmental adaptation, could strengthen your position.

In summary, to enhance your future essays, ensure they directly respond to the prompt with a balanced discussion, minimize spelling and grammatical errors through careful proofreading, simplify your language for clarity, and support your viewpoint with a range of well-explained arguments. Addressing these aspects can significantly improve the coherence and persuasiveness of your writing.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Manufacturers and retail business use colour psychology as an effective way to attract a number of customers when they sell their products. As far as I am concerned that colour is a potential element of marketing when some companies try to sell their products of a highly competitive market. \n As a matter of fact, firms generally invest vast capitals to design a colourful advertisement so as to pay more public attention. Colour affects the customer's attention to make an unconscious decision. Furthermore, colour certainly becomes a particular symbolization for the company's product which is a primary element that people have to notice if they want to find a brand. For example, fast-food restaurants like McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Popeye's all greatly use red in their brands because red creates a sense of urgency and encourages appetite. \n Excitingly, colour completely impacts on some people when they have to make a decision on buying some items because it can boost their confidence. For instance, the adolescent feels more confident when they wear bright and colourful garment than dark ones. This results in a number of young people are completely choosing products and depend on colour. \n In contrast, colour is not the first choice of buyers when they are deciding whether they will buy the product. Because the quality is often more assessed by the customer to make certain that the product's service life can be used for lengths of time. From my points of view; however, colour also has an exclusive ability to attract specific types of consumers and change consumer behaviour. According to research conducted in the United States, 92.6 per cent said that they considered a visual factor as the most important when buying products. \n In conclusion, colour plays a vital role in the overall layout of the retail store and can largely influence the customer's pivotal decision to buy or not to buy. Therefore, manufacturers and retail companies should take advantage of colour psychology so as to use the proper colour scheme for producing items as well as decorating retail stores that attract customer buying their products.","The examiner will be lost when he reads your essay.

However, there are some areas that need improvement to fully meet the requirements of the essay task and to make your arguments more effective.

1. **Topic Response**: It's crucial to directly address the questions or statements given in the prompt. The prompt asks for your personal opinion on the truth of the statement regarding color's influence on purchasing decisions and how it affects your own buying behavior. Your essay, however, seems to introduce a general discussion on color psychology in marketing without directly answering these questions. In future essays, begin by paraphrasing the original topic and clearly stating your position in relation to the prompt's questions. This will ensure that you're on the right track from the start.

2. **Structure and Clarity**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure that directly follows the instructions. For example, it's often recommended to structure your essay into four paragraphs, including an introduction, two body paragraphs addressing the specific questions, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should ideally have a clear main idea and adhere to the word count and sentence limits to stay focused and concise. This structure will help keep your essay organized and make your points clearer to the reader.

3. **Personal Examples**: A key element missing from your essay is personal reflection. The prompt encourages you to use your own buying habits as examples to illustrate how color influences your decision-making process when purchasing items. By incorporating personal examples, your essay would not only adhere more closely to the prompt but also provide a more compelling and relatable argument.

4. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues in your essay. For instance, some sentences could be simplified for clarity, and there are places where a more direct statement could replace a passive construction. Paying attention to these details can improve the readability of your essay and make your arguments more persuasive.

5. **Clear Point of View**: While you mention that color is a ""potential element of marketing,"" your essay could benefit from a clearer expression of your own viewpoint. It's important to articulate whether you agree or disagree with the statement and to what extent, supporting your position with specific reasons and examples.

By addressing these areas, your essay can become more focused, engaging, and effective in discussing how color influences consumer behavior. Remember to always directly answer the prompt, structure your essay clearly, use personal examples, and refine your grammar and style. With these adjustments, your essay will better meet the task requirements and provide a coherent and compelling argument.",4,4,3,3,3,3,2,3,4,1,Argumentative

Although, this issue is controversial, a number of educationalists support considering its advantages. Here in this essay negative and positive effect of the both sides will be discussed. \n Students naturally are more receptive at primary grades. Even they need less time in learning any foreign language than high school students, because they learn with no shy and talk freely without any fear of making mistakes. Moreover, they could pick up the pronunciation more easily as they learn it sub-consciously. For those reason, it is commonly believed that new language should be taught at much young age. \n However, high school students mainly get opportunity to learn another language, and met expert's trainers at this level. Such type of trainers is mostly unavailable in primary educational institution, so it is not possible to be taught second languages in right way. If primary students are learnt with general teacher, the learning may not match the standard of the language, and not be used for study or career in later life. As a result, younger may be trained poorly because of the lack of expert teacher in primary school that is the main pitfall regarding this issue. \n To be conclude, young student have more readiness for learning languages than older.

This is one of those instances because a personal opinion was not required. As such, the 4 paragraph presentation covering the paraphrase, bodies of paragraph and conclusion will be the most acceptable format for this type of discussion. \n I have one concern regarding the original prompt. I cannot help but think that you did not offer the complete original prompt for our consideration because in this portion: \n <em>DO THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES?</em> \n My question is ""The advantages of what?""

Therefore, it's crucial to align your essay more closely with the prompt by clearly distinguishing and discussing the advantages and disadvantages in separate paragraphs. This approach ensures you directly answer the question asked.

Firstly, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of why younger students might excel in learning languages, mentioning their receptiveness and lack of fear in making mistakes. This is a solid start, but the essay would benefit from a clearer structure to effectively convey these points. It is recommended to organize your essay into at least four paragraphs: one for introduction, two for body paragraphs (one presenting disadvantages and one for advantages), and a concluding paragraph. This structure will help in presenting your arguments in a more orderly and impactful manner.

Regarding language and clarity, there are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. Consider revising sentences for clarity and grammatical accuracy, and ensure correct spelling throughout the essay. It's also important to maintain a consistent tense and use appropriate transitions to improve the flow between ideas.

Your point of view is present but could be articulated more clearly. Ensure that each paragraph supports your stance by providing clear and descriptive arguments. For instance, when discussing the potential disadvantages of introducing a foreign language at the primary level, such as the lack of qualified trainers, ensure to also explore how these challenges can be addressed or why the advantages might outweigh these concerns.

In conclusion, the essay touches upon an important educational topic, yet it misses aligning closely with the prompt requirements. By restructuring the essay to clearly present advantages and disadvantages, addressing language and stylistic issues, and sharpening the argumentative stance, the clarity and effectiveness of the essay will significantly improve.

Meanwhile, another research had been conducted by Mathew in German to find the human capacity to utilize both hand equally, namely mix-handed. The experiment involved the number of musician regarding to the type of instrument, the length it was played, and their regular practice. Interestingly, the result showed that keyboardist had high level using both hand, while string players such as violinist preferred one hand. Another experiment showed that handedness is use in some sport such as hockey, tennis and gymnastic. In hockey, the players tend to be mix handed due to the fact that hockey stick must be deployed in two direction. Also, mix handed players is more confident rather than one hand players.

1- **Response to the Topic**: Your essay addresses the topic of handedness effectively by discussing its influence on sports and music. This shows that you understood the main ideas of the research. However, make sure to connect your points more clearly to the topic by explaining why these findings are significant.

2- **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few corrections needed:
   - Use ""Dr. Mathew"" instead of ""Mathew"" to respect professional titles.
   - Be consistent in referring to people or professionals; if starting with 'psychologist,' maintain the terminology throughout the essay.
   - ""German"" should be replaced with ""Germany"" when referring to the country where the research was conducted. Similarly, ""in German"" should be corrected to ""in Germany.""
   - Avoid redundancy by choosing either ""sports"" or ""games"" instead of using both interchangeably.
   - Some sentences could be clearer. For example, ""mix-handed players are more confident rather than one hand players"" could be rewritten for clarity as ""players who can use both hands are often more confident than those who prefer one hand.""

3- **Point of View**: Your essay does present findings from Dr. Mathew's research, but your point of view on the information is not entirely clear. It would be beneficial to explicitly state whether you find the research convincing or if you see potential limitations.

4- **Arguments and Support**: You mention several important findings from the research, such as the difference in handedness among musicians and athletes. However, providing examples of specific musicians or athletes, as well as more detailed explanations of how handedness impacts their performance, would strengthen your essay. This approach not only supports your points better but also adds depth to your analysis.

In conclusion, your essay has a solid foundation but could be significantly improved by addressing these areas.

Should students pay for their colleges' tuition fee, or government?","In some nations, students have to allocate money for the tuition fee of college or university, while some governments spend money for their students' study careers. In my view, the government should make careful decisions when offering financial aid to students as this phenomenon's drawbacks outweigh its benefits. \n It is undeniable that providing students with need-based scholarships creates a bunch of opportunities for students who cannot afford the exorbitant tuition cost. For instance, many states in the USA give financial support to poor citizens who are willing to pursue their careers in public universities. As a result, all students have their own chances to access with formal education in college or universities. However, it seems that the more money supply, the more laziness and dependence occurs on some students as they are fully ensured about their academics career by the governments. Those will become oblivious in their study or may spend the financial aid on other purposes. As a result, the authority may have wasted their budget investing in the wrong individuals. \n Furthermore, governments' aids are not quite flexible, hence, they might not meet the students' requirements. For instance, Vietnam's national scholarship is stable at a thousand dollars per year which cannot fulfill the needs of every individual due to the inconstant cost of tuition fee as well as the basic studying materials of different majors. \n In conclusion, some governments budget for the tuition fee of their students while in others countries, students have to pay it themselves.

You discuss whether governments should provide financial aid to students for their higher education. The stance that the disadvantages of government aid outweigh the benefits is clear, offering a defined viewpoint on the issue.

Firstly, on the topic of language and style, it's essential to maintain a formal tone in academic writing. Phrases like ""a bunch of opportunities"" come off as too casual. A more formal alternative could be ""a multitude of opportunities"" or ""numerous opportunities."" Maintaining a formal tone throughout your essay will enhance its academic quality.

Regarding word choice, there seems to be confusion between the terms ""studies"" and ""career."" It's important to note that ""studies"" pertain to the act of learning or engaging in an academic course, while ""career"" refers to one's professional journey or occupation. Using these terms accurately is crucial to avoid ambiguity and to ensure your message is understood as intended.

Moving on to the structure and clarity of your arguments, it's observed that some sentences and ideas aren't fully developed, making it difficult for readers to follow your reasoning. For instance, when introducing examples or claims, expanding on these with more detailed explanations or supporting evidence would strengthen your argument. Instead of merely stating that government aids are not flexible, elaborating on why this inflexibility is detrimental, with concrete examples, would provide a clearer and more compelling argument. 

Additionally, the essay suggests that financial aid leads to laziness and dependency among students, but this claim needs stronger support. It's beneficial to include credible research or statistics to back such assertions, which would make your argument more persuasive. 

Lastly, your conclusion succinctly reiterates your stance, which is good practice. However, it could be enhanced by briefly summarizing the key points made in your essay to reinforce your argument before stating your final position.

In summary, focusing on using formal language, accurately using terms, developing your ideas with clear and supported arguments, and strengthening your conclusion will significantly improve your essay.

They are able to give the right task to the suitable people. Although within a team, members may have different personalities, good leaders are able to communicate with them to prevent conflicts. \n Secondly, leaders who give good directions and instructions at important moments can help the team surpass difficulties. Take my own experience working as a nurse for example. During each shift, we will have a person who is named the leader of the shift. When an emergency situation comes, such as if a patient needed CPR, leaders will be the ones telling other members how to react. With good leadership, problems can be quickly solved, and members can be put in the right position to do their jobs without panicking and not knowing what to do. \n In conclusion, I believe a good leader unites the team members to work together and give clear and clever instructions when facing challenges and decisions.","There is no clear personal definition of leadership in this presentation.

Here is a detailed breakdown, focusing on your response to the topic, spelling, grammar, stylistic issues, clarity of your viewpoint, and the effectiveness of your arguments.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   Your essay successfully identifies that good leadership is pivotal in achieving efficiency and high productivity within a team setting. However, it lacks a concise personal definition of leadership. It's beneficial to start with a clear, one-paragraph explanation of what leadership means to you before delving into its importance and application. This approach ensures a focused narrative that directly addresses the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   Your essay is largely free from spelling errors, which is commendable. However, paying attention to sentence structures and varying your sentence lengths could enhance the readability of your essay. Short, precise sentences can make strong points, while longer ones are useful for explaining complex ideas. There's a small note on consistency in tense and perspective that could smooth out the reading experience.

3. **Clarity of Viewpoint:**
   Your viewpoint that effective leadership involves uniting team members and providing clear instructions is evident. Nonetheless, emphasizing your personal stance or experiences with leadership further could add a unique perspective to your argument. Sharing more about how you've observed these traits in action or how you aspire to embody them can make your viewpoint more relatable and compelling.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:**
   You've provided a practical example from your experience in nursing to illustrate how leadership functions in emergency situations. This real-world application is a strength of your essay. However, including additional examples or referencing well-known effective leaders could offer a broader understanding and more robust support for your claims. Furthermore, giving a more detailed scenario where leadership skills directly impacted an outcome would offer a clearer demonstration of leadership’s importance.

In conclusion, your essay has a solid foundation in discussing the importance of leadership within a team. To strengthen your essay, consider starting with a clear definition of leadership, enriching your argument with a variety of examples, refining your grammar and sentence structure for readability, and ensuring your personal viewpoint on leadership shines through.

I personally agree with this statement and this following essay will explain it in detail. \n Firstly, over-consumption is attributed as one of the primary factor in our model society. Nowadays, citizens arre encouraged to buy a new product because it is cheaper to use and throw things away rather than reuse them. For example, electronic devices like televisions, radios, CD and DVD players, even laptops - all are occasionally thrown out since the cost that you have to pay to repair is almost two times as high as the new one. \n Secondly, another factor that has added the fuel to the fire is the increase of packing companies which produce single-use products wrapped in non-environmentally friendly materials such as plastic, nylon. Indeed, dwellers are recommended to buy the new products religiously, especially the disposable ones. Because the government believe that this behavior could stimulate economy by increasing the GDP of its own country. \n In conclusion, based on the above mentioned facts the throw-away society becomes among the prime element that has destroyed our environment.","Never make claims about the truth of a statement in an extent essay. That is because there are people who will disagree with your opinion, that creates a false statement not implied in the original discussion. Always state the opposing opinion in your paraphrase along with the response to the question. By the way, your response lacks an extent representation or emotional response. The strength could be strongly, urgently, unquestionably, etc. There needs to be a descriptive response to the extent. \n Avoid using connecting words like ""because"" to start a sentence. That word is used to connect ideas, phrases, and other thoughts in the sentence representation. \n Your paragraphs lack clarity due to your failure to use a proper mix of simple and complex sentences. Make sure you use 3-5 sentences of various lengths per paragraph so you can meet that specific GRA requirement.","The essay does address the topic, focusing on how over-consumption and packaging companies contribute to environmental waste. However, there are areas for improvement to make the argument stronger and the writing more effective.

1. **Clarity of Position**: It's important to present your opinion as one perspective among many, rather than a universal truth. Instead of starting with ""It is true,"" introduce the essay by acknowledging the complexity of the issue, such as ""Many believe that our environment suffers from waste that is difficult to recycle, a perspective I agree with due to several reasons."" This approach allows room for different viewpoints and shows you're engaging thoughtfully with the topic.

2. **Use of Connective Words**: The essay sometimes uses connective words, like ""because,"" in places where a new sentence starts. This can disrupt the flow of ideas. Connective words should link ideas within a sentence. You could improve sentence structure by integrating these words more smoothly into your arguments. For example, instead of starting a sentence with ""Because,"" try restructuring: ""The government encourages buying new products, believing this behavior could stimulate the economy by increasing GDP.""

3. **Sentence Variety**: The essay could benefit from a mix of simple and complex sentences to clearly convey your points. This variety makes your writing more engaging and easier to follow. Aim to use 3-5 sentences of varying length and structure in each paragraph. 

4. **Expressing the Degree of Agreement**: When you express agreement or disagreement with a statement, it's helpful to specify how strongly you feel. Instead of simply agreeing, consider adding an adverb to describe your stance, such as ""strongly agree"" or ""partially agree."" This will provide more depth to your position.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: While the essay presents factors contributing to environmental waste, including more detailed examples or data would strengthen these arguments. When discussing over-consumption or the impact of packaging companies, specific studies, statistics, or incidents can provide concrete evidence to support your opinion.

In summary, your essay has a solid foundation, discussing a relevant environmental issue with clear points. Focused improvements on presenting your perspective as one among many, refining sentence structures, and enriching your arguments with more specific examples or data will enhance your essay significantly. Remember, effective communication in writing is not just about sharing ideas but doing so in a way that engages and persuades your reader.

4278,https://essayforum.com/writing/prefer-online-courses-study-think-better-81971/,test,Some prefer online courses to study and they think it is better. Others prefer classroom education. Discuss both views and share your opinion.,"In the modern era, doing online course or receiving classroom education have become a highly controversial issue. There are those who feel that taking online course is better than receiving classroom education however other believe otherwise. In this essay I will examine both sides of compelling argument and provide my overall opinion. \n From an overall perspective, there are two primary reasons why people believe strongly that taking online course is more beneficial than attending a class in person. Perhaps the cogent reason why people are in favour of this notion is because online course saves money. This is because students do not have to pay for travel. For a particular example, a Vietnamese student taking English lesson does not have to travel a long way to UK, which means money saving. A further point in particularly favour this idea is that students can study anytime. For a classic instance, a student can study during 1-hour break time at work. Unlike in the dim and distant past when the Internet was not available, students nowadays can meet their online teachers at midnight. \n Despite these strong arguments, there is also a case for the idea that classroom education is better than Internet-based course. Perhaps the sound reason why people are in favour of this idea is that students can sharpen social skills in class. An excellent illustration of this is that a student, who is having argument with other student over a heated issue, learns how to supress black anger. A further point in greatly favour of this notion is that in classroom education student acquires critical thinking skills. For a typical example, during a debate, students have to formulate solid reasons. \n In conclusion, having considered both sides of argument, I would have to say that online course is advantageous for students with limited time availability and geography restrictions and classroom education for social skills development and critical thinking training. If a student could take both online course and classroom education, he would be a more successful student.","Dear student, your essay could use stronger adjectives in its presentation. Rather than using the term ""strong arguments"", try to win the reader over to the existing side of the discussion by using more convincing adjectives other than strong. Words like convincing, compelling, and persuasive in reference to the term ""arguments"" offer a more authoritative support for your discussion presentation. It also shows a less common vocabulary usage which could help to increase your LR score. \n Don't present uncertain thoughts such as ""Perhaps the sound reason..."" Use conviction at all times to create a strong TA representation. Use the phrase; ""The sound reason..."" to offer a clear understanding of what you want to say. Since you are speaking for one side of the discussion, you cannot be uncertain when representing the thoughts of others. You need to present it in a manner that the supporter would by using convincing representations of the statement. By the way, know when to use ""a"" and ""an"". When the next word starts with a vowel such as ""for example"", ""an"" is the indefinite article to be used. \n Please always remind yourself that your paragraph sentence presentation can only be between 3-5 sentences. So do not over-discuss a paragraph by trying to use 2 reasons in one paragraph. For this type of essay, you have 3 reasoning paragraphs to use. 2 for the public points of view and one for your personal opinion. The personal opinion cannot be the concluding paragraph of the essay. The personal opinion is always one of the 3 reasoning paragraphs. The conclusion is known as the concluding summary which should merely reiterate the presented discussion topics, its reasons, and your personal opinion, as a reminder to the examiner who by then, should be ready to grade your essay. \n Overall you had a good approach to this essay for a first timer. You had some missteps but that is to be expected when one first writes this type of essay.

However, there are areas where improvements can enhance clarity, persuasiveness, and overall coherence. Here are specific suggestions:

1. **Responding to the Topic**: Your essay correctly addresses the assigned topic by examining both sides of the argument concerning online courses versus classroom education. This approach is commendable as it demonstrates an understanding of the question. However, ensure your conclusion succinctly summarizes these viewpoints while clearly stating your position. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Watch out for grammatical errors, such as the misuse of articles (""a"" versus ""an""). Remember, ""an"" is used before vowels and vowel sounds, as in ""an example"". Additionally, strive for stronger and more varied adjectives to describe arguments. Instead of ""strong arguments"", terms like ""convincing"", ""compelling"", or ""persuasive"" can provide more depth and authority to your discussion, potentially improving your language proficiency scores. Also, be decisive in your word choice to avoid presenting uncertain thoughts. For instance, replace phrases like ""Perhaps the sound reason…"" with ""The sound reason…”, to convey conviction in your presentation.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay presents a viewpoint that acknowledges the benefits of both online and classroom education, which is a balanced perspective. Nevertheless, ensure that your personal opinion is introduced in one of the main body paragraphs rather than in the conclusion. This structure gives your viewpoint its deserved focus and integrates it more effectively into the discussion.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Details**: Your essay includes relevant examples to support your arguments, which strengthens your position. However, it's crucial to organize your paragraphs effectively. Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph and avoid discussing multiple major points in a single paragraph. This helps maintain clarity and focus. The essay should have separate paragraphs for discussing public points of view, with one specifically dedicated to your personal stance. Remember, your conclusion should reiterate the discussion topics, reasons, and your viewpoint, serving as a concise summary for the reader.

5. **Overall Cohesion and Coherence**: To improve the flow of your essay, ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next. This can be achieved through transitional phrases and a logical sequence of ideas. Your essay would benefit from a clearer demarcation between paragraphs dedicated to general discussion and those expressing personal opinion, as per essay writing conventions.

In essence, with targeted refinements in grammar, style, organization, and argumentation, your essay has the potential to effectively communicate your insights and achieve a higher proficiency level.

4279,https://essayforum.com/writing/university-students-study-orientation-81229/,test,IELTS TASK2 - Should university students' study orientation,"Some persist that the freedom for university students to select courses on their own, while others regard useful subjects such as science and technology significantly. Personally, having the freedom to choose what to study and learning useful knowledge from required subjects both seem reasonable to me. \n First of all, those who hold the second statement have their sound reasons. A key point lies in the fact that allowing applied subjects can offer necessary human capital for economic growth. Economic and social development, especially in those underdeveloped countries has a huge demand for talents in science and technology. Therefore, university authorities should devote limited financial resources to those required useful subjects as a priority. \n On the other hand, people who insist on the first statement also have a strong voice. It can be observed easily that the freedom to choose or interest-oriented study can motivate students' potentials to a fuller extent. Students' interest in a particular field undoubtedly leads to their passion to explore and investigate, which may bring about in this area. Secondly, such freedom is more beneficial to students' all-round development. For instance, art courses cultivate student's taste, math enhances logical thinking and analytical ability, accounting molds patience and carefulness. Some may argue that these benefits are irrelevant to practical skills that the useful or required subjects can bring to students. However, no doubt that practical skills without logic, analytical skills and carefulness may do harm to students' future career. \n The discussion cited above demonstrates two viewpoints regarding study orientation o university students. The former focus on the significance of the applied subjects which may provide economic growth and social development. While the latter concerns about the importance of freedom to choose courses which leads to multiple improvements. Thus it is safe to conclude that both statements are both convincing.","Dear student, this is a discussion of 2 public points of view along with your personal point of view. You decided to discuss this essay from a singular point of view alone. Therefore, you created a prompt deviation and as such, will receive a low score for it. When you write a Task 2 essay, you must always follow the discussion instruction provided to you in the original prompt. So that means, if it says; ""Discuss both these views and give your own opinion."", you write a 5 paragraph essay covering that discussion. The 3 reasoning paragraphs cover the 2 opposing public points of view and then, the 3rd paragraph discusses your personal opinion based on the evidence presented in the 2 point of view discussion. That is why this essay has performed a prompt deviation that will prevent it from getting a passing score. \n Your essay is not truly closed because you created a personal discussion in the last paragraph of your presentation. The closing paragraph should summarize the information provided as a recap or reminder for the reader. It is not supposed to contain new information for the discussion as that constitutes an open ended essay rather than a closed essay. \n BTW, please remember the cornerstone rule for writing any of the IELTS essays. The rule of thumb, this is unchangeable and directly affects your scoring potential, is that you should not write less than 3 sentences, no more than 5 sentences, and you should focus on only one topic per paragraph to help increase the scoring possibility of your essay. Clarity in discussion can only be achieved when you develop only one discussion topic per paragraph. It helps to keep the discussion free of clutter and allows it to pay proper attention to the paragraph discussion topic. This in turn helps to increase your overall scoring possibility.","This essay attempts to explore the debate around whether university students should have the freedom to select their own courses or if they should focus on subjects deemed useful, like science and technology. Overall, the exploration of this topic is valuable, but there are several areas where the essay could be improved to enhance clarity, relevance, and coherence.

Firstly, the structure of the essay does not fully align with the typical expectations for an argumentative essay. The task typically requires discussing multiple perspectives before concluding with a personal viewpoint. In this case, integrating an explicit discussion of both viewpoints presented in the prompt, followed by a separate, clearly stated personal opinion would make the argument stronger and more aligned with the expected format. Consider using a five-paragraph structure: an introduction, one paragraph for each viewpoint, one paragraph for your personal opinion, and a concluding paragraph.

The conclusion of the essay should serve as a summary of the arguments presented rather than introducing new information or personal insights. A strong conclusion recaps the key points made throughout the essay, reinforcing the thesis without venturing into new discussion territory.

Regarding paragraph structure, aim for clarity and focus by adhering to the guide of writing 3 to 5 sentences per paragraph, concentrating on a single topic or argument in each. This approach will not only enhance the readability of your essay but also improve its overall organization, making your arguments more compelling and easier to follow.

In terms of content, while the essay recognizes the importance of both freedom in course selection and the value of concentrating on useful subjects, it lacks distinct arguments that conclusively support the author's position. Expanding on how these viewpoints impact students' motivation, career preparation, and overall development could provide a more solid foundation for your perspective.

On a stylistic note, the essay is mostly well-written but does have minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could be refined. Paying closer attention to these details would improve the professional quality of the essay.

Finally, the point of view expressed in the essay sometimes feels ambiguous. Making a strong, clear statement of your personal stance after discussing the other perspectives would not only fulfill the prompt's requirements but also give your essay a more persuasive edge.

Improving these aspects of the essay will make your argument more compelling, clearer, and in line with the expectations for this type of writing task.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

In the past, people only spend money on daily necessities. However, as time goes by, people's standard of living has improved, shopping no longer limit to necessities but can be or pleasure. Though there are some drawbacks to this trend, the positive impacts are far more remarkable. \n Shopping as a hobby means that people are putting more money into buying extraordinary things. It in turn favours international trading. Businessmen strikes to provide innovative and new products to customers. Subsequently, it creates more jobs. For example, fast fashion has taken the fashion world by storm. It creates large demand for affordable clothing, which can only be made in less developed countries where the cost of labour is the least. Nevertheless, it provides job opportunities and help these impoverished countries to keep up with the development of other countries. Moreover, it can be a life changer to these people by improving their livelihood. \n Furthermore, i provides the exchange of cultures. Some people spend money on artifacts as a hobby, it may not be of practical use but it definitely carries history and culture. The image of the Tower of London appears on various keychains and T-shirts across London. Imagine how many tourists will be intrigued to learn the history of the Tower of London because of these souvenirs all round the city due to the demand of shopping for leisure. \n To me, the change of shopping culture brings more positivity than drawbacks. There is never a change that is perfect and acceptable by all but I do believe this change in the nature of shopping is beneficial to us on the long-term.","I believe that your discussion is in error. You discussed the act of creating goods for shopping and its benefits to the businessmen and society. The actual discussion was asking about shopping changing from being a routine task, meaning something people have to do repeatedly, whether they want to or not, to becoming a hobby, meaning people do it for fun. Your essay did not consider the actual application of the keywords ""hobby"" and ""routine task"" . Due to your misunderstanding of the keywords, you did not properly develop the essay. It should have reflected the attitude of people towards shopping which is, from being something they have to do even if they don't want to, to something that they are doing regularly because they get benefits from doing it as a hobby. As a routine task, shopping means always buying the same goods every time you go to the store. By shopping as a hobby, one can buy different things are various stores, it is no longer a preset list of items to buy every week, hence the term ""routine task"".","Your essay explores the evolution of shopping from a necessity to a hobby and its societal impacts. However, there are several areas we can work on to enhance your essay further.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay leans towards the broader effects of shopping as a hobby but doesn't clearly address the transition from shopping as a routine task to a hobby. It's important to emphasize how shopping attitudes have shifted - from buying the same essential items out of necessity to exploring and purchasing various goods for enjoyment. Adding examples or elaborating on how people's approach to shopping has changed over time could make your argument stronger and more directly responsive to the prompt.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammar mistakes that need attention. For instance, ""i provides the exchange of cultures"" should be corrected to ""It provides the exchange of cultures."" Remember to capitalize the first word of each sentence and pay close attention to subject-verb agreement. Also, using more varied sentence structures could make your writing more engaging.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: Your viewpoint that shopping as a hobby has more positive than negative impacts comes through. To make it even clearer, you could introduce your essay with a thesis statement that reflects this view and conclude with a paragraph that reinforces your stance, summarizing how the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You present compelling arguments about the benefits of shopping as a hobby, like boosting international trade and cultural exchange. However, your essay could benefit from directly connecting these points to how the perception of shopping has shifted from a routine task to a hobby. For example, considering how this new approach to shopping enriches individuals' lives beyond just economic benefits could provide a deeper understanding of the topic. Additionally, including counterarguments to acknowledge potential drawbacks while explaining why the positives are superior could strengthen your position.

By refining your focus on how shopping has transitioned from a necessity to a leisure activity, addressing minor grammatical issues, and providing more direct support for your arguments, your essay will become more convincing and engaging.

However, whether people should explore their home country or other countries remains controversial. In my opinion, traveling abroad is more beneficial than traveling locally. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will discuss in the following paragraphs. \n First of all, it is the best way to learn a new language. Visiting a foreign country provides us with the opportunity to immerse ourselves in their language, which enhances our vocabulary as well as speaking fluency. For instance, last summer, I had a journey to Japan. It was a fascinating experience. Everyone around me speaks Japanese, and almost everything, from the menu in the restaurants, to the instruction signs in libraries or other public places, to the advertising pinned up around towns, is all written in this language. Hence, I have the chance to expand my vocabulary and practice my speaking skills. Having spent a few months in the native country, I no longer find it difficult to express my ideas in Japanese. As a matter of fact, I am now able to communicate clearly and coherently and be confident in my language ability. That is how traveling to a foreign country can benefit us in learning a second or third language. \n Second, traveling overseas allows us to explore a variety of cultures around the globe. Not all people on this Earth share the same lifestyle. Each country, each region has its own unique lifestyles. Thus, Stepping foot in foreign lands will open our minds and offer us a different look about the world. For example, my family once had a vacation in Egypt. We gained a great deal of knowledge about their history, people, and traditions. We were surprised to listen to stories about ancient Egypt from local people. In addition, we also participate in many special rituals and interesting festivals, which left me with unforgettable memories. It appears that the cultural barrier is completely removed. The deeper understandings I have of them, the more I admire and appreciate their civilization. That is the reason why it is better for people to travel abroad. \n In conclusion, I believe that international travelling brings more advantages than domestic traveling because it creates a perfect environment to study a new language and also helps us explore many exotic cultures around the world.","While you did write an extremely interesting essay, I believe that you lost track of time. You wrote a research paper rather than an opinion paper. An opinion paper is written within 250-290 words. A research paper is anywhere from 300-500 words. Writing up to 290 words will be possible within 40 minutes, 401 words, not so much. Stick to the opinion paper word count for the Task 2 essay. The advised length is within the 275-290 word count. Trust me, you will thank me for this advice. \n Your essay is over explained. You need to discuss within no more than 3-5 sentences per paragraph. That means, the target sentence count is anywhere from 20-25 sentences, depending upon if you are writing a 4 paragraph (20 sentences) or 5 paragraph (25 sentences) essay. You need to explain yourself quickly but clearly. Do not over emphasize, you need to watch the time allotment. Writing too many words means you will run out of time to edit your work. \n You also need to remind yourself of your tense usage. In this essay, you are referring to a previous time you had spent in Japan. So use the past frame work of sentence presentations. By the way, you are not Japanese, so you cannot say ""having spent time in the native country"". A native is someone who was born and raised in Japan. You merely spent time ""in the country"" since you were not born in Japan. There is a big difference between the two reference phrases. \n Your opening paragraph is not an accurate paraphrase of the original discussion. You actually began discussing the topic in that paragraph which is not the way to go. That paragraph is used only to show off your English comprehension skills and your ability to restate information using an English thought process. Hence: \n <em>Going to other countries often has positive results for most folk. However, there are others who believe that there are more gainful experiences to be had by traveling within their own nation. Having spent time in Japan, I am more in agreement with the belief that there are more notable results for people who experience life in other regions of the world.</em> \n The example above is a better representation of the original prompt and discussion instructions. \n Your conclusion is good, but represents a run-on sentence. Divide it. You have to make sure to meet the sentence requirements per paragraph. Make sure that you clearly restate the original prompt before you present your opinion and reasons in that section. You have to do that because it is a new paraphrase of the original topic and your discussion reasons.","Your essay on the importance of traveling, comparing the benefits of traveling abroad versus locally, is insightful and engaging. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to the guidelines of an opinion paper. 

1. **Adherence to Topic and Word Count**: The essay effectively addresses the topic by arguing that traveling abroad is more beneficial than traveling locally. However, the content length exceeds the recommended 275-290 words for this type of task. Keeping the essay within this word limit ensures that the argument is concise and manageable within the time constraints of the exam. Aim to streamline your thoughts and present your ideas more succinctly.

2. **Structure and Sentence Count**: The essay's structure is clear but tends to be overly detailed, leading to an excessive number of sentences per paragraph. Aiming for 3-5 sentences per paragraph, with a total of 20-25 sentences for the whole essay, is advisable. This will help in making your argument more direct and in ensuring there's enough time for revision.

3. **Grammar and Tense Usage**: Pay attention to tense consistency. When discussing past experiences, such as your trip to Japan, maintain the past tense to keep the narrative coherent. Also, revise phrases to accurately reflect your experiences — for instance, replace ""having spent time in the native country"" with ""having spent time in the country,"" as ""native"" implies birth and upbringing in the place.

4. **Opening Paragraph**: The initial paragraph should paraphrase the original prompt accurately, showcasing your comprehension and rephrasing abilities without delving into the topic discussion. A more focused paraphrase would tighten your introduction and better set the stage for your argument.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion effectively summarizes your stance but can be streamlined to avoid run-on sentences. Dividing your thoughts into more concise sentences will aid readability and impact. Ensure that the conclusion restates the original prompt before delving into your opinion, providing a clear closure to your argument.

6. **Clarity and Coherence**: While the essay is well-written, focusing on clarity and coherence is vital. Ensure your points are directly linked to the advantages of traveling abroad, with clear and concise examples supporting your argument. This will enhance the persuasive power of your essay.

By addressing these areas, your essay will not only adhere more closely to the guidelines but also present your arguments in a clearer, more effective manner.

This essay will elaborate on the leading cause of this problem and practical solutions to overcome this hardship. \n There are two main factors attributed to the increase in hunger all over the world. Firstly, in many countries, especially underdeveloped ones, farmers are financially incapable of purchasing sophisticated machines. They continue following old-fashioned methods and failing to apply technologies in their crops, in turns, their outcomes cannot meet the demand of the increasing population. Secondly, the frequent occurrence of natural disasters is another reason for the hunger issue. Many East-South Asian and African nations, in which have to deal with floods and droughts annually, have fewer opportunities to develop agricultural activities than others. While these catastrophes have gigantic damage to crops, farmers have no solutions to protect their crops but accept the truth and prepare for the next one. As a result, many of these nations' citizens do not have enough food to maintain their lives. \n However, world hunger can be reduced by some effective solutions. The governments can support the farmers by lending them an amount of money in order to buy some automatic and labor-saving machines and also some high-quality plant seeds. This measure helps farmers save time and enhance crop yield. Furthermore, thriving nations can provide underdeveloped countries with sufficient aid such as fundings and agricultural machinery. This not only creates better opportunities for farmer increase the production of food but also strengthen the relationship among regions and countries. \n In conclusion, the lack of modern technologies applied in farming and the devastation of natural disasters can be ascribed to the increasing global hunger.

While the intent is commendable, there are areas for improvement that could enhance clarity, cohesiveness, and overall effectiveness in addressing the topic.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay successfully identifies and expounds on the causes of global hunger and suggests potential solutions. However, it begins by merely restating the essay prompt without offering a solid thesis statement. Developing a concise thesis statement that directly addresses the question could better guide the reader through your argument. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay exhibits a recurrent use of run-on sentences, making it challenging for readers to follow. It's essential to distinguish between complex sentences that enhance your argument and run-on sentences that complicate comprehension. Additionally, a more consistent use of punctuation could improve readability. It is advisable to revisit grammar rules related to sentence structure and punctuation.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The viewpoint is discernable but could be made more explicit with direct answers to the essay questions. A clear thesis statement in the introduction and topic sentences in each paragraph would help articulate your stance more clearly, providing a roadmap for the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay outlines causes and suggests solutions to global hunger effectively but misses an opportunity to address a broader range of stakeholders. Apart from government intervention, consider discussing the role of the private sector, particularly global food suppliers, in addressing hunger. This would offer a more comprehensive view of potential solutions. 

In summary, the essay has a strong foundation but can benefit from fine-tuning sentence structure, enhancing clarity with a direct thesis statement and topic sentences, and expanding the range of solutions considered. Reviewing grammar rules and focusing on concise, clear writing will significantly improve the essay's effectiveness.

Take for example working mothers, they do their tasks professionally and still have time to bring up children. \n Conversely, focused students are likely to achieve better academic results, thereby securing admission to higher-tier schools. It is because abilities to focus on one thing at time will reflect the ability to complete the task at a higher level of proficiency. Some argued tgat the modern workplaces now demand soft skills, where these children might come up short , unlike their peers who may develop these skills through their interaction with a great variety of people. Yet, as career become increasing specialized, the ability to hone particular skills may ultimately trump sociability. \n With the above in mind, it is clear both approaches have positive and negative aspects. While the part time workers may gain multitasking skills, the academic students benefit from a better focus on their task.","the reference point in your essay is off. You need make various references within the paragraphs to the parental line of reasoning. That is because each reason must come from the parents pov. Your current presentation doesn't make that clear. The simple reference to parents reminds the reader about who is speaking or being discussed throughout the essay. \n Do your best to avoid mere restatements of the prompt reasoning as you do in your current presentation. Boost the restatement with additional information that supports the pov being discussed. While you do a good job of restating the reasons provided, you always stop short of giving a full explanation based on the sample you provided. A sample must always be explained. Limit your paraphrase to 2 sentences, using the remaining 3 sentence allotment to better explain the meaning of the sample. \n Your concluding paragraph deviates from the prompt. There is no mention of the parental point of view, discussion reasons presented, and a proper closing sentence. These would help to increase your TA score as you better showcase your English comprehension skills based on your given discussion. \n In relation to this, your opening paragraph has a run on sentence in the opening presentation. Split the sentence with a period instead of a comma. 3 clear sentences are better scored than a single run on sentence in terms of gra scoring. \n While your work was good and shows a degree of high scoring potential.

However, there are several areas where your writing could be improved to more clearly express your ideas and better align with the essay prompt. 

1. **Topic Response and Clarity**: Your essay addresses the topic by discussing the two perspectives on whether children should work while studying. To enhance clarity and maintain focus on the parental viewpoints, frequently reference these perspectives throughout your essay. This will remind the reader of the basis for each argument and ensure that your discussion remains centered on the parents' points of view.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some spelling and grammar mistakes in your essay (""balamce"" should be ""balance"", ""live"" should be ""life"", ""argued tgat"" should be ""argued that""). Also, consider breaking up lengthy sentences for improved readability and to avoid run-on sentences. For example, using periods instead of commas in your opening paragraph would make your essay clearer and easier to follow.

3. **Point of View and Arguments**: Though you reiterated the reasons from the prompt well, your essay would benefit from deeper explanations and examples. When providing examples, explain their significance and how they support the parental viewpoint being discussed. This deeper analysis will strengthen your argument and demonstrate a better understanding of the subject.

4. **Concluding Paragraph**: The conclusion needs to tie back to the parental perspectives mentioned throughout the essay more directly. It should also summarize the discussion reasons more effectively and end with a strong closing sentence. This reinforces your understanding of the essay's topic and showcases your English comprehension skills.

5. **Additional Insights**: When introducing examples or reasons, limit your paraphrase to a concise presentation, then use the opportunity to expand on their implications or why they're important. This approach will provide a more robust and informative exploration of each viewpoint.

In summary, your essay shows potential but could be significantly enhanced by closely linking your discussion to the parental perspectives, addressing grammar and style issues, elaborating on your examples and reasons, and refining your concluding paragraph. These improvements will not only make your essay more coherent but also demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Therefore, many suggest that imposing a heavy tax on such products can discourage potential consumers. From my perspective, I believe that this solution can be sufficient. \n First of all, the introduction of said law will expectedly be a heated debate. Since most economical goods available in the current market fall under the ""unhealthy"" category, with such a tremendous tax increase, the majority of the population would not be able to afford such luxury. However, it is not certain that the price of the more health-beneficial products will be deducted. Therefore, inflation will assumingly take place, leading to public controversy. \n On the other hand, it is crucial that government funding is allocated to the production of less health-deleterious food as well as the promotion of sustainable consumerism. It is likely that once an individual is committed to a healthy lifestyle and fully acknowledges the perks of the alteration, they will be willing to maintain such practice in the long run. Besides, if health-conscious diets are broadcasted, the related illness would be curbed. As a consequence, the global health care system will be elated and may switch its focus to more innovative developments. \n In conclusion, the initial adaption to such a drastically different diet may cause unease. However, a sharp rise in tax imposition on junk as well as the promotion of sufficient eating habits food should be proficient at disregarding people from self-damaging.","<quotation>and other concerning preservatives</quotation> \n Do not add information to the presentation. Doing so alters the original content presentation and reduces the accuracy score for the restatement. \n <quotation>I believe that this solution can be sufficient.</quotation> \n The discussion instruction is not asking if you think the solution is acceptable.

Here's how you could improve your essay:

1. **Topic Response:** It's crucial that your opinion directly responds to the question. Instead of saying, ""I believe that this solution can be sufficient,"" more explicitly state whether you agree or disagree with the suggestion of imposing heavy taxes on unhealthy products. This will make your stance clearer to the reader.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** You've managed to convey your thoughts with minimal grammatical errors, which is commendable. However, phrases like ""health-beneficial products"" could be simplified to ""healthier products"" for clarity and ease of understanding. Additionally, avoiding complex constructions such as ""the introduction of said law will expectedly be a heated debate"" could also enhance readability. Consider ""the proposed law is likely to cause debate"" for a clearer expression.

3. **Clarity of Author's Viewpoint:** Your point of view is somewhat clear but could be more directly stated as mentioned earlier. This will not only respond directly to the essay question but also guide the reader through your reasoning.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While you mention important considerations like the potential for inflation and the importance of promoting healthier lifestyles, remember to focus closely on the central topic – the effect of taxing unhealthy food and drinks. For example, discuss more deeply how taxation could lead to reduced consumption of such products or explore the potential for taxed revenues to support health initiatives. Avoid diverging into topics that stray too far from the main question, like inflation and the pricing of healthier goods, unless directly linking these back to the core discussion of taxing unhealthy food and beverages.

To enhance your essay further, tie your argument back to your thesis more tightly in each paragraph, ensuring all discussion points directly support your stance on the tax's efficacy in discouraging unhealthy consumption habits. Additionally, concrete examples or data could strengthen your position. 

Remember, the clarity of your argument and how directly it answers the question is paramount. Aim for simplicity and precision in language to make your essay more accessible and compelling. Keep practicing, and use these tips to refine your writing further!",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Others believe that some information is too important and too valuable to be shared freely.","It is often claimed that sharing scientific, technological or academic knowledge freely is beneficial. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that some information should be kept confidential. \n On the one hand, it is understandable why there is a belief that information in terms of science, business and technology should be accessible. For one, people will be raised their awareness to enhance their life by getting access to certain scientific researches. The natural ecosystem and people's health have been threatened by great changes in the environment in recent years. For example, the phenomenon of climate change spread widely in our society encourages scientists to carry out geoengineering projects to reduce the effects of global warming on the Earth. In addition, the lack of information in the academic world would be a noticeable obstacle for students to achieve efficiency in their self-learning processes. This is because it is difficult for those to update the newest mainstream related to their major which is excluded in their textbook. \n On the other hand, I would maintain that some secret information should be available to a certain extent. For example, if information related to nuclear weapons science falls into wrong hands, it is more likely to trigger exponentially war or terrorist activities. Another reason is that it takes researchers much time and effort to complete their researches, therefore people who want to be accepted to their works are advisable to pay for scientists' endeavors. This can be explained by the fact that researchers do not have funds for their works, hence they are not encouraged to continue to generate science if people do not give them credit by a bit payment. \n In conclusion, although both views certainly have some validity, it seems to me that it is better to safeguard the information that is sensitive and valuable to organizations and countries.","The original discussion instruction for this essay is asked you to discuss both points of view and then present a personal opinion.

However, there are a few key areas where improvement is needed to more effectively meet the requirements of the essay prompt and enhance the overall quality of your writing.

1. **Addressing the Essay Prompt:** The instructions for the essay asked you to discuss multiple perspectives before presenting your personal opinion. Your essay could benefit from a more structured approach, ideally organizing your response into five paragraphs. This would include an introduction, the presentation of the first public point of view, a comparison with a second public point of view, a synthesis of both viewpoints, and finally, your personal analysis. This structure will help you fully address the prompt and demonstrate your ability to analyze different perspectives.

2. **Use of Pronouns and Perspective:** In your essay, you mainly use the first person (""I"") when presenting your opinion. To align with the essay's requirements, aim to discuss the initial public viewpoints using the second person (plural), such as ""people believe"" or ""some argue,"" before shifting to the first person (singular) to express your own analysis in the concluding paragraph. This shift in pronouns will help clarify whose perspective is being presented at each point in the essay, making your argumentation more effective.

3. **Clarity and Development of Arguments:** Your essay would benefit from clearer and more descriptive arguments. When presenting the public viewpoints, provide specific examples and reasons why people might hold these views. Then, when presenting your analysis, build on these discussions to present a thoughtful, personal perspective. Specifically, explaining the reasons behind your belief that some information should remain confidential would strengthen your position.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** While not the primary focus of this feedback, paying attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues will also improve the readability and professionalism of your essay. Keeping sentences clear and concise can help convey your arguments more effectively.

In conclusion, focus on meeting the essay's structural requirements by clearly presenting and comparing different points of view before concluding with your personal analysis. Use pronouns effectively to distinguish between public viewpoints and your own perspective. Enhancing the clarity and detail of your arguments will make your essay more persuasive and engaging.

Second, the disparity between rich and poor also leads to the escalating rate of crime because needy people are deprived of daily necessities. \n There are several actions that could be taken to solve the problems.

Here is some feedback to help improve your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** You've started well by addressing the topic of the rich-poor gap. However, to fully meet the requirements of the essay, make sure to answer specific questions from the prompt directly. For example, if the prompt asks for problems and solutions, clearly define these in your thesis statement. This will make your main point stronger and more focused.

2. **Word Count:** It's important to meet the minimum word count requirement (in this case, 250 words). Falling short can lead to automatic deductions in your score. To add more content, consider expanding on your examples, adding more detailed descriptions of the problems, or including additional solutions.

3. **Grammar and Style:** Your essay has a few spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. Remember to use complete sentences and correct verb tenses. For example, ""cover basic needs for poor people"" could be more accurately phrased as ""covering basic needs for poor people."" Also, watch out for run-on sentences and try to vary your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.

4. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your viewpoint on the issue is present but could be made clearer. A more explicit thesis statement at the beginning would help clarify your stance. Additionally, directly linking your examples and solutions to your main argument will make your position stronger.

5. **Arguments and Support:** You offer two main points: social prejudice and an increase in crime rate as consequences of the wealth gap. These points could be strengthened with more detailed examples or data. Also, when suggesting solutions, explain why these would be effective in more detail. Providing evidence or more extended explanations can make your argument more convincing.

6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion summarizes the essay's main points but could be more impactful by emphasizing the significance of addressing the gap between rich and poor. A powerful closing thought can leave a lasting impression on the reader.

In my opinion, the two central problems that city dweller encounter is poor air quality and inadequate housing and I totally agree that any governmental encouragement can contribute to mitigate these current problems. \n The perennial problem in big cities all over the world is bad air quality. Due to the high volume of traffic, the exhaust fumes released are enormous. For example, most people in Vietnam favour private vehicles over mass transit basically because of their flexibility. This takes a toll on the air people breathe every day and as a consequence, residents, especially those from the youth and elderly population suffer severe respiratory conditions like lung cancer. The second pressing matter is the dearth of housing areas. More and more people move to bigger cities in the search for career prospects and better living standards, inevitably leading to increasing demand for dwellings. The implications of which are skyrocketing prices of properties and those who can not afford will be pushed to run-down places, resulting in the formation of slums. For example, a square meter of land in big cities in Vietnam can inflict cost 30 times larger than that of rural areas and many young people end up living in dilapidated buildings if they want to anchor to the city. \n If people are motivated by the government to move to less popular towns, I believe pronounced changes are expected. Firstly, the reduction of traffic volume means a fall in the amount of toxic gases poisoning the air. This will leads to the situation in which everyone enjoys a better atmosphere. Secondly, if more people relocate to the smaller towns, the drain on city dwellers' mind concerning the property will be eliminated as there is more space now and the price will go down. There will be no concern about where to find a decent place without an astronomical price tag. \n In conclusion, air pollution and housing shortage are the main issues pertaining to a city life and I completely agree that government should stimulate more people's migration to less crowded cities.","The topic restatement is highly confusing. If it is a suggestion, then why did is suddenly turn into a statement of fact in the middle of the sentence? A suggestion for a plan of action is not the same as a plan already in action. The writer has not clearly presented the idea behind the topic restatement. Instead of trying to create a very long sentence, the aim should have been to present a short but clear restatement. An introduction is totally unnecessary. A statement of representation is all that is needed to create a clear rephrasing of the original idea. The writer created a run on sentence in the last line since a totally different idea that could not be connected to the previous idea by the word ""and"" was provided. Unless related to a previously presented idea, an unrelated idea or response to a question should never be included in the same sentence. Each idea should represent only 1 idea either alone or within a cohesive context.","The essay addresses the topic, which focuses on the benefits of encouraging people to move from overcrowded cities to less populated towns. However, the introduction's clarity could be improved. Instead of merging several ideas into one lengthy sentence, aim for a succinct and accurate restatement of the topic. This will help clarify your position from the start.

In terms of spelling and grammar, the essay is well-written. However, there are minor stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, the essay could benefit from shorter, clearer sentences to avoid confusion. There's a tendency to create long sentences that mix different ideas, making the essay harder to follow. Each idea should be presented clearly and separately to ensure the reader can easily understand and follow your arguments.

The point of view is clear: there is strong support for the government encouraging people to move to less populated areas to solve problems like poor air quality and inadequate housing in big cities. This stance is consistently maintained throughout the essay, which is good.

The arguments supporting this viewpoint are clear and descriptive, particularly the examples of air pollution and housing shortages in Vietnam. These examples vividly illustrate the issues faced by city dwellers and how relocating could potentially offer solutions. However, to strengthen your essay further, consider exploring a wider range of benefits that relocating could offer, in addition to improved air quality and more available housing. This would provide a more comprehensive view of why this strategy should be adopted.

In conclusion, while the essay presents strong arguments and is generally well-structured, focusing on clearer sentence construction and a more succinct introduction would improve its clarity and effectiveness.

This great influence can be seen in three main aspects demonstrated in the following essay. \n The first facet is associated with education. The access to abundant learning resources and global information from the Internet enables children in rural areas to receive an education chance they deserve. In the past two decades, the literacy rate in China has a significant rise by over ten percent. One particularly good example is that more and more children lived in a small village in Sichuan have been literate through the Internet. This outcome should be attributed to establishing the infrastructure of Internet in remote areas. \n The other aspect is conservation of paper resource. Being replaced by Internet, books are not the most important method of transmitting information, which has considerably decreased the demand of paper and greatly prevented forest from deforestation. Furthermore, it also saves a great deal of time by clicking on a button instead of searching library shelves. \n Despite these advantages above, the drawback of the free flow of information is that people have difficulty to tell its reliability in this information flooding generation. For instance, it is said that the U.S. election in 2016 was manipulated by Russia through inserting fake advertisement into Facebook and hacking American's identity. It is the most serious problem I have ever seen that the untruthful information on the Internet have the power of controlling the election of a country. \n In conclusion, although the flow of information has greatly benefited to human's life by increasing the literacy rate and conserving paper, it is undeniable that the social media should be properly regulated to avoid the case above happen again","Dear student, your essay was going pretty well until you decided to discuss the US elections. Don't delve on discussing unproven and debatable facts as actual information in an essay. Stay neutral at all times.

If you compare the topic for discussion and the discussion instructions you were provided, you went totally rogue with your concluding statement. This means that your essay was no longer on track with the discussion and as such, would have lost valuable points in the final scoring. A word of caution, please avoid making factual references to things such as percentages and placed in these sorts of essays. If it is not public knowledge and will require you to do research, don't even try to include it. Research is the one thing you will not have the time, nor the access to at the testing center. It is important that your discussions be based purely on commonly known information so that you can focus on proving your ability to write in English rather than your ability to research in English. The research part does not factor in the scoring and could prevent you from gaining additional time for the editing and finalization of your essay prior to submission.","The essay demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic, focusing on the significant impact of the internet on various aspects of human life. You've effectively outlined how the internet has transformed education and paper consumption, presenting clear arguments that support your position. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of your essay.

1. **Relevance to Topic**: Your essay starts well, directly addressing the topic by discussing the internet's influence on education and conservation of paper resources. However, the discussion about the U.S. elections veers off-topic, introducing controversial and potentially unverified information. Stick to universally recognized facts and directly related arguments to maintain focus and relevancy. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing that can be improved for better readability and precision. For instance:
   - ""human's life"" could be revised to ""human life"" for conciseness.
   - ""Internet has a dramatic impact"" could be improved to ""the Internet has had a dramatic impact"" for grammatical accuracy.
   - ""children lived in a small village in Sichuan have been literate through the Internet"" can be clearer as ""children living in small villages in Sichuan have become literate through the internet.""

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is generally clear, with a structured argument that supports the beneficial impact of the internet. However, ensure every paragraph aligns with the topic to maintain a consistent point of view throughout.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: Your essay contains strong examples, such as the increase in literacy rates in China due to internet access. However, when providing statistics or specific claims, ensure the information is widely acknowledged and avoid referencing material that might require verification. This keeps the focus on your English proficiency and not on the accuracy of external data.

5. **Neutral Tone and Content**: Avoid delving into contentious subjects or controversial claims, as seen in the paragraph about the U.S. elections. Not only does this distract from the primary topic, but it can also introduce bias. Stay neutral and focus on broadly accepted information to keep the essay balanced and objective.

To improve, concentrate on tightening your arguments to directly address the essay topic, correcting grammatical errors, and maintaining a factual and neutral tone.

I opine that both sides will give valuable insights with the appropriate arrangement. \n Having the responsibility to understand abundant school lessons will probably enrich the student's knowledge. However, it leads into under pressure atmosphere and is more likely to make the student do other activities during ongoing class to cope with stress. Taking an example, South Korean Senior High School students are forced to study for more than 12 hours per day, and it continues day by day. Thus, chatting with their friends during class become more popular in recent years. \n Interactive classes with one focused subject are more probably motivated the student to develop their ability since they are feeling happy. The comfortable ambience offered will raise student's creativities to create such innovation, which have a valuable function. For instance, since the 2013 curriculum had established in Indonesia, students were given the freedom to prioritize a school subject. This new approach is proven for increasing the student's invention in the last seven years. \n In my opinion, the curriculum should be given in the general approach to give the student a clear study foundation. Then, they allow to choose their favourite subject to be an expert to develop meaningful results in their subject. \n In conclusion, encouraging students to conquer all school subjects will benefit for the student's knowledge to tackle the future challenges, while a tailored one will bring the pupils to be a star in their preferred subject. The education ministry should consider the youngster's potential when planning a curriculum study.","Improving your grammar is one thing, actually writing an essay that applies to the prompt discussion is another. Your overall essay failed to address the requirement of the original topic. That is, you did not properly discuss the essay based on the 2 public points of view, prior to your delivering a personal point of view. You did not use the suggested / required discussion topics for the discussion. This led to the overall incorrect discussion topic and format in your reasoning paragraphs. \n The topics for discussion are: \n - teenagers should concentrate on all school subjects. \n - teenagers should focus on the subject that they are good at or that they find the most interest. \n - give your opinion based on a comparison of the two discussion points. \n Your opinion must be based on the comparative points, proving a side of the discussion you support instead of developing a point of view that is not indicated in the original prompt. You are not to deviate from the original prompt topics and discussion format. Your opinion should not be stated at the end of the paraphrase as you have not compared the positive and negative elements of the two discussion topics yet.

Only secondary students, young adults, youngsters, or adolescents may be referred to in the essay since it refers to teenagers. Stay on point and do not make a mistake with synonym usage. That will affect your LR score. \n Like I said, your discussion points are incorrect since you are not using the given topics from the original prompt. I cannot review your essay beyond this point because of the error in discussion topic and format. Both of which resulted in a prompt alteration on your part. The essay is incorrect overall.","The essay attempts to navigate the complex issue of whether students should broaden their knowledge across all subjects or concentrate on those they are most passionate about. While these reflections are valuable, the essay deviates from the specific task instructions, which require a focus on secondary students, and a comparative analysis based on two distinct viewpoints before presenting a personal opinion. 

Firstly, it's essential to directly respond to the essay prompt by discussing the perspectives that teenagers should engage with all school subjects to gain a broad knowledge base and the alternative view that they should specialize in subjects where they excel or find most interesting. The essay should compare these approaches before your personal stance is introduced, ensuring your opinion emerges from a balanced discussion of these viewpoints. 

The essay somewhat conflates the experiences of primary and secondary students, which could lead to confusion, as the prompt specifically targets the latter’s educational journey. It's crucial to maintain clarity by adhering to the intended age group, which would enhance your argument's relevance and accuracy.

Regarding language use, the essay exhibits a thoughtful attempt to articulate ideas; however, there are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For example, maintaining consistent tense, ensuring subject-verb agreement, and choosing the right words for the context can greatly improve the readability and impact of your writing. It's also pertinent to be mindful of using the correct terms and synonyms that accurately reflect the original prompt's language and intention. Misinterpretations or incorrect synonym use could lead to a deviation from the intended discussion points, which impacts the coherence of your argument.

Your essay introduces examples to illustrate points, which is a strong technique. However, these examples should be clearly tied to the central discussion points mandated by the essay prompt. Ensuring that your examples directly support the argument will make your essay more persuasive and focused.

In conclusion, focusing on the prescribed discussion topics, improving language accuracy, and ensuring that your examples and arguments directly address the prompt will make your essay more coherent and compelling.

The attempt to address both sides of the issue is commendable and helps provide a balanced view. However, there are several areas for improvement that could enhance the overall clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Without the full prompt, it's challenging to gauge if the essay fully addresses the required elements. For future essays, ensuring that the response covers all aspects of the prompt is crucial for a comprehensive discussion.

2. **Word Count:** Achieving the minimum word count is essential for your essay to be properly evaluated. Falling short of this can prevent your essay from receiving a complete assessment. Aim for a word count within the 275-290 range to offer a detailed discussion while showcasing your writing skills effectively.

3. **Spelling and Word Usage Issues:**
   - Correct spelling is vital for clarity. Errors such as ""aboved"" (above), ""expansation"" (expansion), ""fufil"" (fulfill), and others distract from the content.
   - Pay attention to correct word usage to avoid confusion; for example, ""lifestyle"" is one word, and ""brings"" should be used instead of ""bring"" to match the subject-verb agreement.
   - Ensure all instances of the word ""I"" are capitalized when referring to oneself, but not in other cases unless indicating a proper noun.

4. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues:**
   - Look out for run-on sentences and consider breaking them down into shorter, more concise sentences to improve readability.
   - Use consistent tenses throughout the essay to maintain clarity and coherence.

5. **Clarity and Descriptive Arguments:**
   - While the essay attempts to provide arguments for both views of economic development, expanding on these points with specific examples and clearer explanations would strengthen the argumentation.
   - Ensure that each paragraph has a clear main idea that is supported with relevant details and explanations.

6. **Point of View:** The personal point of view is somewhat clear but could be made stronger with more direct statements about your stance and a clearer connection between the introduction and conclusion.

Consequently, it is expected that this tendency will bring an unimaginable change in our future life. Though, in overall, this opportunity will have good as well as bad effects on human's life, however I strongly believe that advantageous sides will overweigh the disadvantageous sides in this case. \n From its' born in previous century, computer technology has been changing our life in various ways. We can now conduct our business from anywhere instead of having a meeting with clients physically. In this era, when computer technology has eased our life incredibly, we need not to sit on our official desk to control and operate the official task. The positive sides which are being extracted from this tendency are - saving our valuable time, reducing the transportation cost, reducing the office time traffic congestion - as people can reach to the office physically at time when he wants, and so on. Most importantly, it will reduce our physical efforts. \n Admittedly, the advantageous events of the future life changes for technological improvements of computer are lucidly noticeable, however there will have some serious negative issues also. As it will be the reason of the reduction of physical activities, it may create dangerous health issues, such as overweight problem with high obesity, heart disease, blood cholesterol increment, melancholiness and frustration - as it will be the reason of loneliness. \n In conclusion, this technological changes would make our life more comfortable, while we might suffer some significant health problem, which could reduce our average life expectancy eventually.","Dear student, You did a great job in presenting the Task Accuracy requirements of the first paragraph.

You will get a passing score if you can present your prompt paraphrase in this manner during the actual test. \n You do have some grammar problems that will cause the pulling down of your final score though. For example, you used the term ""melancholiness"", which is not a word that exists in the dictionary. The term that does exists in the dictionary is melancholies. Spelling mistakes will cause LR scoring reductions. \n Your first reasoning paragraph will also cause a C&C reduction due to the existence of discussion topics, but no actual discussion development or explanations are presented. All these reasoning paragraphs need only 1 topic per paragraph. Properly explain the reasoning and use supporting information to establish the validity of your discussion. Don't just keep giving reasons without explanations. \n The last paragraph should only be a discussion summary, it should not add a new topic for discussion because that creates a open ended essay. You have to properly summarize the discussion using the original topic, your reasoning topic sentences, and finally, a closing sentence to properly summarize your presentation. What you did, presenting health considerations at the very end of the essay created an open ended essay that would have reduced your TA score to a certain degree.","This essay provides a thoughtful perspective on how technological advancements in computing have reshaped our daily lives and makes a compelling argument that these changes will have a predominantly positive effect, despite potential negative consequences. The opening paragraph effectively sets the stage by clearly stating the essay's stance, which aligns well with the topic. This is a strong start that captures the reader's interest and directly addresses the essay prompt.

However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity and impact of the essay:

1. **Grammar and Spelling**: It is crucial to pay attention to grammar and spelling to communicate your ideas clearly and professionally. For instance, the use of ""melancholiness"" is incorrect; the correct term is ""melancholy."" Mistakes like these can distract the reader and potentially lower the overall score of your essay. Regular proofreading and using a dictionary or spell-checker can help mitigate these errors.

2. **Development of Ideas**: While the essay presents several reasons supporting the thesis, these ideas need further development and explanation. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea and offer detailed support. This could include examples, explanations, or data that reinforce your argument. Rather than listing multiple points in one paragraph, dive deeper into each point to demonstrate its relevance and impact comprehensively.

3. **Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph should effectively summarize the essay's main points without introducing new topics. The mention of potential health problems towards the end introduces a new discussion theme rather than summarizing previous arguments. Aim to restate your main thesis and key supporting points in the conclusion to reinforce your argument and provide a strong, cohesive finish to the essay.

4. **Paragraph Structure**: To enhance cohesion and coherence, organize your essay with one main idea per paragraph. Present your argument, follow it with supporting evidence or explanations, and then conclude the paragraph by linking back to your main thesis. This structure helps maintain focus and makes it easier for the reader to follow your line of reasoning.

Incorporating these suggestions will not only improve the grammatical accuracy and structure of your essay but also strengthen your arguments, making your perspective clearer and more persuasive.

What can be done to protect endangered animals?","It is said that wildlife habitats have been negatively affected and some animal species have been on the verge of extinction. In this essay, I would indicate reasons why this happens and some solutions to tackle it for animal conservation. \n The main cause that has a considerable influence on animal habitats is human activities. Due to the growth of urbanization all over the world people, cut down trees to generate more land for farming and building industrial areas, which affects directly to animal's homes. For example, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest causes a numerous impact on animal species, including Amazonian jaguar and various monkeys. Another activity that threatens endangered species is that some people are keen on collecting body parts of wildlife animals such as ivory of elephants, horns of rhinos, and scales of pangolins. This increases the supply of illegal poaching and wildlife trafficking since the profit they get from selling these rare products are enormous. Besides, climate change is considered as a cause leading to the loss of biodiversity such as global warming, natural disasters and other phenomenon. For instance, rising temperatures leading to rising sea level in the Arctic could disrupt the ecosystem and force many species to adapt or face extinction such as polar bears, coral reefs, and others. \n Because of the above activities, some measures are suggested to decrease its impacts. Firstly, we need to make efforts to save endangered species by raising public awareness since humans are the main reason for these consequences. For example: World Wildlife Fund( WWF) is the largest conservation organization globally which has effective campaigns to protect endangered species, conserve habitats and promote sustainable practices about environmental issues. Second solution is that the government must enact legislation related to preserving animal habitats because if there is interference of law, citizens will change their perception about protecting the natural habitat of animals. Overhunting could be declined due to the amount of fine \n In conclusion, there are a variety of factors causing negative influences on endangered species, therefore, people need to take action by modifying their performances on the environment to limit these issues.","Good work on the paraphrasing.

This subject is well-chosen and relevant, showing that the essay responds to the topic effectively. 

However, there's a clear need for a more distinct expression of your own viewpoint. While you do outline the issue and propose solutions, incorporating your personal perspective in a more explicit manner could strengthen your argument. For instance, after introducing the problem, briefly summarizing your stance on the solutions or emphasizing which solution you believe is most critical could make your position clearer. This helps in making your essay more engaging and persuasive.

Your essay has a rich vocabulary, which is commendable. Yet, there are some issues with sentence structure that need attention. Using a variety of sentence types—simple, compound, and complex—can enhance the readability of your essay. It's important to present your ideas in a way that makes them easy to understand. Clear and well-developed sentences will help in conveying your thoughts more smoothly and contribute to a better overall structure of your essay.

The overuse of complex information and ideas sometimes makes the essay difficult to follow. Aim for clarity by breaking down complex ideas into simpler, more digestible parts. When discussing solutions, for example, you could dedicate a sentence or two to each solution, explaining how it works and why it's effective. This will help in maintaining a coherent flow of ideas throughout the essay.

In the paragraphs where you delve into the causes of habitat destruction and propose solutions, adding specific examples, as you did with the Amazon rainforest, helps illustrate your points vividly. Continuing this approach with other points would reinforce your arguments and make them more convincing.

On spelling and grammar, there are minor errors that could be easily fixed with a thorough proofreading session. Paying close attention to grammatical correctness and spell-checking your work will refine the professionalism of your essay.

Lastly, the conclusion ties the essay together but could be strengthened by reiterating your key points and personal view more forcefully. A persuasive conclusion leaves a lasting impression on the reader.

Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. \n To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children? \n Education is likely the most critical thing learned by every child, and that education is not restricted to academic lessons only but also in behavior field as well. Punishment is believed to be required in educating a child about the differences between right and wrong behaviors. Personally, I disagree almost entirely with this opinion. \n First and foremost, behavioral teaching is a gradual process that needs a combination of parents, teachers, and children themselves. Therefore, punishment seems not always to have much of a role to play in this. To some extent, we should consider the age as well as the stage of a child to punish them. Punishing a very young child is either wrong or foolish because they are too small to recognize the issues they are confronting, or even it can entail detrimental consequences unintended by the parents. Adolescents should be rewarded for good behaviors and discouraged from wrongdoings. \n Instead of harsh punishment, there is a variety of alternative methods that assist parents to discipline their children charges. The reasonable fact is adolescents show a tendency for practicing parental actions as well as attitudes. Consequently, parents should provide good role modeling in their own behaviors. Moreover, children should be conscious that they have to be accountable for their own actions. Making the punishment fit the crime is a feasible way, for instance, young children can be asked to pick up rubbish they have dropped, or apologize to someone they have hurt. In these ways, responsibilities are enhanced in the child. \n As expressed, children need education about morality and teaching to distinguish good things from bad ones in the early stage. In addition, the older should utilize an appropriate approach to behavioral teaching. Punishment should not be excessively physical, rather than psychological and practical.","<quotation><del>Education is likely the most critical thing learned by every child, and that education is not restricted to academic lessons only but also in behavior field as well.</del></quotation> \n This is not partof the orginal presentation.

Focus should have been solely placed on the punishment discussion as indicated in the instructions.","The essay attempts to address the topic of what sort of punishment parents and teachers should use to teach good behavior to children. It offers a clear stance against physical punishment, advocating for alternative, more positive discipline methods. However, there are several aspects that can be improved to make the essay more effective and aligned with the prompt's requirements.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay begins by broadening the topic to include the overall education of a child, going beyond the specific question of punishment. The focus should be tightened to directly address the types of punishment for teaching good behavior, as this is the core issue the essay prompt asks about. Try restructuring the introduction to directly answer the question about punishment.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor grammatical errors throughout the essay. Although these errors do not majorly hinder understanding, careful proofreading could eliminate them, creating a polished final product. For example, paying attention to article usage (""the behavior field"" instead of ""behavior field"") and agreement (""children themselves"" instead of ""children himself"") would enhance clarity.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The essay clearly conveys a stance against harsh punishments and favors alternatives that teach responsibility and accountability. This viewpoint is consistent throughout the essay. However, explicitly connecting each argument back to the central thesis will strengthen the essay's cohesiveness.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides a variety of alternative methods to punishment and underscores the importance of role modeling by parents. These arguments support the author's position well but could be enhanced by including more specific examples or studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of non-punitive discipline methods. Additionally, the discussion occasionally diverts from the main focus on punishment. It's crucial to continually tie back to how the alternative methods serve as effective substitutes for punishment.

To improve, the essay would benefit from a clearer and more direct response to the prompt, focusing specifically on the question of punishment without veering into the broader topic of education. Each paragraph should explicitly support the thesis, avoiding deviations into general discussions about behavior and education not directly related to punishment. Incorporating feedback, specific examples, and ensuring grammatical accuracy will significantly elevate the essay.

By addressing these points, the revised essay would likely offer a compelling argument against punitive measures for teaching good behavior, supported by clear, well-structured, and relevant evidence.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

A child still in school is at an age that having the desire of being noticed. Wearing famous-branded clothes or shoes is a common way, which definitely need a big amount of money.

The earlier one understand this, the better they are prepared for getting into this society. By earning money from a good grade, students can experience this common rule and follow it. \n Although one may say that giving too much money to children for score is not a good idea, I believe that a children can actually start early learning how to manage their own money under a proper instruction from parents. When I was a kid, my mom used to gave me money as a reward for good grades. I usually use those money to buy my favorite snakes and toys. It is my mom who give me a chance to decide how to use my own money. The most significant thing, however, is that she also taught me how to deal with it. She told me that I should always save one third of it for the future in terms of buying things that I extremely want while it was not cheap. In this way, I can not only learn knowledge about science from school, but also master how to make a good use of my own save. \n All in all, using money as the reward of a good grade can motivate students to be hardworking, can teach them about earning, and can give them a chance to learn how to manage their own money.

Errors such as ""a well educated student always have an edge"" should be corrected to ""a well-educated student always has an edge"".

Specially when the writer is not even sure if he is actually following the required prompt discussion.

### Response to Topic
Your essay addresses the topic, exploring both sides of the job commitment debate. However, it's crucial to adhere closely to the prompt's requirements. There's an indication that your essay might slightly veer off from the core discussion by introducing personal encouragement in the conclusion, which wasn't requested in the prompt. Keeping your conclusion focused on summarizing the arguments without adding new advice would be more effective and prompt-adherent.

### Writing Style and Structure
The approach to explaining your viewpoint could benefit from clearer organization. Typically, essays should present the general opinion of the public using third person (e.g., ""they,"" ""people"") and then your personal viewpoint using the first person (e.g., ""I believe""). It helps distinguish between the general perspective and your own, ensuring the reader clearly understands your position. Incorporating this distinction more clearly could enhance the coherence of your argument.

### Word Count and Overwriting
Being concise is important. Your essay appears to be too long, which might not be feasible within the time limit of the test. Overwriting can also dilute your main points, making your essay less impactful. Focusing on making each word count and directly supporting your argument can improve your essay's effectiveness and ensure you remain within a manageable word count.

### Grammar and Stylistic Issues
There are some grammatical errors and sentence structures that could be simplified. For example, consider revising parts like ""we might learn new techniques, accumulate working experience comprehend more expertise and acquire more knowledge experience from experts"" to streamlined sentences like ""we might learn new techniques and gain experience from experts."" Simplifying language not only makes your essay clearer but also helps you avoid errors.

### Argument Clarity and Support
Your arguments for both perspectives are outlined, but making your personal stance and the reasoning behind it more distinct would strengthen your essay. Ensure that each paragraph supports your viewpoint directly, comparing, and contrasting the two sides based on the questions: What is the public understanding? and Do I support this opinion? Why?

### Conclusion
Your closing paragraph should summarize the previously made points without introducing new ideas. Eliminate the encouragement for action, as it deviates from the essay's analytical purpose.

4296,https://essayforum.com/writing/advertisements-drawbacks-benefits-82614/,test,IELTS writing task 2 - Advertisements - drawbacks and benefits,"Advertising is becoming ubiquitous these days due to the rapid development of the economy and an increasing number of new business. From my perspective, such a development, although detrimental at some points, could be seen as an essential step forward. \n On the one hand, advertisements bring several benefits to both customers and companies. Advertising informs people about the existence of a variety of products in the market before making a purchase. For instance, if someone wants to buy a watch, they can check out numerous advertisements, including both online and offline ads, to decide which one is the most appropriate product. Moreover, this marketing strategy also helps the companies build customer's loyalty and contributes to its reputation. It is clear that the popularity of advertising has paved the way for an incredible speed of economic growth. \n On the other hand, promoting advertising widespread is disadvantageous in some certain aspects. Firstly, customers can be misled and manipulated by the firms. In other words, different appealing advertisements in the supermarkets could affect buyers to make impulsive purchasers for unnecessary products. Furthermore, some companies make false claims to the customers by exaggerating the real quality of the products. As a result, people buy unqualified products have to bear all the costs such as money, time or even their health. Needless to say, advertising still obtains its own adverse ramifications, which people need to avoid. \n In conclusion, although there are some drawbacks of daily advertising, I believe this new term of marketing will revolutionary develop to the prosperity of the economy as well as people standard life.","Dear student, this is not a comparison essay. This is a single opinion essay whose response is based upon one of the two choices provided to you in the original discussion prompt. Your approach to the essay used the comparison discussion approach instead which, although acceptable to a certain extent, will limit the actual high score your essay can achieve through a proper task response. Had you chosen to address the essay from one supporting angle, you would have scored better with this essay as it would have shown your ability to understand the given instructions and discuss it accordingly. Due to the comparison discussion that you used, the essay failed to totally and accurately respond to the prompt requirements. So I do not believe that this is an essay that can receive a passing score.","Your essay on the topic of advertising presents a thoughtful discussion on both the advantages and disadvantages of advertisements in the modern economy. However, to refine and improve your essay, consider the following aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay attempts a balanced view by discussing both the positive and negative impacts of advertising. While this provides a comprehensive outlook, it's important to align more closely with the specific requirements of the prompt. If the task was to take a clear stance or to discuss the topic from one perspective, focusing more exclusively on either the positive or negative aspects could have strengthened your position and aligned better with the prompt’s expectations.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are minor errors and room for improvement in your essay. For instance:
   - The term ""customer's loyalty"" should be ""customers' loyalty"" to reflect the loyalty of multiple customers.
   - Be cautious of phrases like “advertising widespread” which might be more clearly expressed as “the widespread nature of advertising.”
   - Pay attention to plural and singular forms (“an increasing number of new business” should be “businesses”).

Improving on these points will make your writing more precise and easier to follow.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your essay presents a clear point of view, acknowledging that while advertising has its drawbacks, you believe its benefits outweigh these. This stance gives your essay a clear direction, but make sure that your thesis statement distinctly reflects this belief right from the introduction to guide your readers effectively.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You offer clear arguments supporting both the positive and negative impacts of advertising, using examples to illustrate your points. To enhance your essay, ensure that each argument is directly linked back to how it supports your overall point of view. For the arguments to have a stronger impact, more specific examples, data, or expert opinions could further validate your claims.

Remember, being specific and direct in addressing the essay prompt not only shows your understanding of the topic but also demonstrates your ability to focus and argue a point effectively. Additionally, reviewing your essay for grammatical accuracy and clarity can immensely improve its readability and impact.

4297,https://essayforum.com/writing/attendance-higher-education-students-class-76041/,test,The attendance of Higher education students in the class,"It seems to be true that higher education level is dominated by adult learners. As such, many claim that the students in university can choose to attend the classes or not because they have right to do so. Albeit the institution has their specific role regarding the student presence, I prefer to agree with this notion due to several justifications. \n First and and foremost, studying in university is different with studying in the school. This comparison can be seen from the curriculum they used. University's curriculum has designed to be more flexible based on each major's need. Likewise, the source of information that lecturer used is more variatif and sometimes can be found in internet. That is why, student can learn it outside the class. Hence, it proves that student can determine their presence or absentation in the class room. \n Another justification comes from the fact that university students tend to get involved in many different organisations in order for improving their self-development. As a result, they can not stay in the class totally. Interrestingly, there a lot of cases that someone who is seldom following the class has a high achievement too. Taking my friend, vera, as instance. She is very active in her research organisation. Thus, she rare to involve class, but she usually learn her subject outside the class or lend her friend's book. Ultimately, she has a high score in her class and being the best graduate in her major. This example has proven that absenteeism is not the only one measurement to be glorious in university. More than that, the key word is how students managing their priority. \n In conclusion, although a fully presence is good for student, it seems to me that it will be wrong for obligating university's student for this rule. I personally prefer to saying that they have right to consider some decision whether they attend classes or vice versa. Furthermore, students in higher education need to develope their self with enrole in several organisations.","Dear student, the first problem of this essay is that you did not include the original prompt requirement in the presentation of the essay instructions. A provided title does not us what we need to know about the requirements of the topic you are being asked to discuss. It is important that you always attach the original instructions when you as us to review your essay. \n The second problem with your essay has a lot to do with the first problem. The opening statement must always be a proper paraphrasing of the original prompt topic and required discussion instructions, prior to the presentation of your opinion. In this instance, your paraphrasing is not clear. It does not really tell the reader what the topic is about in an understandable manner and your outline for discussion is non-existent. So when you present your opinion to the reader, the question becomes ""What is this person talking about?"" These problems will result in a failing task accuracy score. \n Your lexical resource should never include localized language such as ""variatif"". It is imperative that you use only accurate American or British English words (depending upon the kind of test you are taking). When you use localized (English) slang, the examiner will most likely not know what you are talking about and consider this a lexical error, which will result in deducted points based upon unfamiliarity with the English language. \n When you speak of your friend Vera, make sure the capitalize her name as that is a proper noun. Your last sentence is incorrect because you used the term ""keyword"" which means one word that delivers the meaning of a sentence. In this sentence, you required a whole phrase to describe the subject of the sentence. So you should have said ""Key words"" or ""Key Phrase"" instead.","Your essay brings up interesting points about the flexibility and independence of university studies and the importance of self-development beyond traditional classroom attendance. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make your argument clearer and more persuasive.

1. **Topic Response**: It's crucial to start your essay with a clear paraphrase of the given topic or question. Your introduction should directly address the prompt, clearly outlining your stance and the main arguments you plan to discuss. This wasn't fully achieved in your essay, which may leave readers uncertain about the exact focus of your discussion.

2. **Language and Vocabulary**: Make sure to use standard English vocabulary that's widely recognized. Words like ""variatif"" aren’t part of standard American or British English and might confuse readers or examiners. Choosing the appropriate vocabulary is essential for your essay to be understood and taken seriously.

3. **Grammar and Style**: Pay attention to small details, such as spelling and proper noun capitalization (for example, always capitalize the names of people, like ""Vera""). Also, consider simplifying your language for clarity. Phrases like ""absentation"" are not only uncommon but can detract from the readability of your essay. Instead, you can use ""absence"" or ""not attending classes.""

4. **Argument Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure that explicitly states your main arguments in support of your point of view. Each paragraph should open with a topic sentence that introduces the argument or point you will discuss. Your paragraphs do bring up supportive examples, such as your friend Vera's experience, which is good. However, ensure every example directly ties back to your main argument, reinforcing your stance.

5. **Use of Evidence**: When mentioning examples, such as Vera's success despite frequent absences, make sure they are fully explained and clearly linked to the broader point you’re making. This will strengthen your argument, showing that active engagement in extracurricular activities can supplement or even enhance academic performance. Remember to generalize these observations to show that this can apply to more students than just Vera.

6. **Clarity of Opinion**: While your point of view is present, it could be stated more clearly and confidently. Avoid ambiguous language and ensure your conclusion strongly reaffirms your stance on the topic, summarizing how your arguments support this position. 

7. **Conclusion Improvement**: Your conclusion should not only restate your stance but also briefly summarize the key arguments supporting that stance. This helps consolidate your position and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of your perspective.

Improving on these points will make your essay stronger, clearer, and more persuasive. Keep practicing, and consider these tips in your next essay to enhance your writing skills further.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative
4298,https://essayforum.com/writing/universities-accept-equal-numbers-male-female-95599/,test,IELTS-TASK2: Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.,"It is sometimes argued that every subject at universities should reach an equal number of students from two different genders. I totally disagree with this view for a number of reasons. \n Firstly, it would be unrealistic to apply this scheme. Each major has its own characteristics and attributes that might be more suitable for a particular gender than the other, and help them get a thorough preparation for future careers. Occupations such as country soldiers or firefighters are usually preferred to males as their physical capacity is superior to females. It can therefore be argued that it would be illogical to fix the number of boys and girls in every university subject. \n Moreover, This new policy might also hinder problems for students and the universities themselves. Learners may struggle to register for their desirable classes because of their sexes. When a subject is fully-enrolled by a fixed number of men, which means other males cannot apply anymore even if this subject might lack its female students to process. Apart from controlling class availability, this scheme might also result in financial challenges for school management. Having to open more classes to accommodate students' needs, schools might need to pay for a larger amount of money for lecturers as well as teaching equipment. It can thereby negatively affect the process of learning and teaching in universities. \n In conclusion, I strongly believe that having to balance the number of men and women in every subject is unreasonable and it can create numerous problems for both educational institutions and learners.","<quotation>sometimes argued</quotation> \n So not make controversial claims in the restatement. It alters the original topic presentation and therefore, changes the actual topic presentation from the original. In this case, it went from a statement of fact to a debate. That means you will lose points for the slight topic discussion focus change. Good job on your opinion presentation. It aligns itself with the writing guide question. \n The first paragraph is not a very good argument since the roles of soldiers and firefighters now welcome women into the ranks. You cannot use this as a reason since it is not supported by the common knowledge anymore. It is already acceptable to see women in these fields. The second paragraph can do better in terms of defending the male presence in classes. The reasons presented are not well developed and prevent the full idea development in the presentation.","The essay effectively addresses the given topic by presenting a clear stance on the issue of gender equality in university subject enrollment. This alignment with the task is commendable. However, there are several aspects that could significantly enhance the essay both in content and form.

1. **Topic Presentation**:
   The essay begins by slightly altering the premise of the discussion. Phrases like ""it is sometimes argued"" may shift the focus from a clear-cut assertion to a more debatable presentation, potentially leading to a misunderstanding of the essay's objective. To improve, start by directly addressing the topic without implying controversy unless it's a central part of the discussion.

2. **Arguments and Examples**:
   - The examples used to support the main points, particularly in the first argument about gender suitability for certain occupations, are outdated. The roles of soldiers and firefighters, for example, have evolved to become more inclusive of women. Using more current examples that reflect the ongoing changes in societal norms would strengthen the essay's arguments.
   - The second paragraph introduces valid concerns about the proposed policy, such as enrollment difficulties and financial challenges for institutions. However, these arguments need further development to clearly understand their impact. Expanding on how these issues specifically affect students and the educational process would make the argument more convincing.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**:
   - The essay maintains a coherent structure, with each paragraph introducing a new argument. Ensuring each argument is fully developed and supported with relevant, updated examples would enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.
   - Using transitional phrases to smoothly link ideas between paragraphs can also improve the essay's flow and readability.

4. **Language and Style**:
   - There are minor spelling and grammatical issues that distract from the message, such as ""Moreover, This new policy might also hinder problems"" where ""This"" should not be capitalized mid-sentence. Paying attention to such details can greatly improve the essay's professionalism.
   - Aim for consistency in formal academic writing. Avoid colloquial expressions and ensure correct punctuation and spelling throughout the essay.

In conclusion, while the essay presents a clear viewpoint and is structured around relevant arguments, refining the argumentative support using current and fully developed examples, alongside polishing the language and presentation, would considerably elevate the work. Addressing these areas will not only make the argument more persuasive but also enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the essay.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

It can not be denied that it bring great economic benefits, but there are some serious concern about this kind of food. However, some others argue that GM food is necessary if we want to meet the demand of an increasing world population. \n Let start with the definition of GM foods which are produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA by using the methods of genetic engineering. It is often claimed that there are several concerns have been raised regarding this. Firstly, mentioning the effect on the environment that certain traits of GM crops might be introduced into the wild. Also, genetically modified plants grown on farms are given traits that will make them resistant to the effects of herbicides, pesticides and drought. For example, spreading of genetically modified plants beyond controlled areas to become ""super weeds"". Secondly, the effect on the human body should be considered. According to many scientific study, antibiotic resistant bacteria are often used to mark genetically modified plant cells. Using GM food means that people are putting antibiotic resistant plant cells into their digestive systems. Thus, this may cause to effect on the good bacteria in their intestinal tract. \n However, some people believed that GM food is essential to meet the demands for an increasing world population. It is applied to provide a number of benefits to producers and consumers. These consist of reduced production costs which can make foods cheaper, fewer chemicals in vegetative products because of their improved pest resistance as well as less stress on the environment due to lower need for using toxic pesticides. In addition, it also improved availability as fruits maintain freshness in seasons when they would not be normally available. These are several great benefits that this kind of food bring to our life. \n The second reason for continuing the GM foods is providing enough food for humans. In fact, the population is growing while food is at risk of being lacking, thus humanity wants to have livestock varieties that have some superiority in order to be able to provide enough food. For example, plants that are well drought resistant and highly resistant to pests in order to increase crop yields. \n In conclusion, GM foods bring a lot of benefits for producers and consumers, beside having some nervousness about environment and human body as well. In my view of point, although genetically modified foods cause several concerns, it should be continuously sale and produce because of its benefits and human demand in the world.","<quotation>Let start with the definition of GM foods</quotation> \n It is not necessary to define what genetically modified foods are to the reader.

However, there are various areas that need improvement to make your essay more compelling, clear, and aligned with the topic. Here are some points to consider for enhancement:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to discuss the pros and cons of GM foods, which aligns with the prompt. Nonetheless, the inclusion of a definition for GM foods, though informative, strays from the immediate discussion of their impacts. The task requires a focused debate on the advantages and disadvantages, assuming the reader already understands what GM foods are. Staying closely related to the discussion points outlined in the prompt will make your essay more relevant and focused.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are minor grammatical errors and instances of awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For example, ""it bring great economic benefits"" should be ""it brings great economic benefits,"" and ""there are some serious concern"" should be ""there are some serious concerns."" Paying attention to verb tense and subject-verb agreement will enhance the readability of your work. Also, consider using transition phrases to smoothly link your ideas and improve the overall flow of the essay.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your viewpoint, favoring the continuation of GM foods despite the concerns, is stated towards the end of the essay. While this perspective is clear, it would strengthen your argument to assert your stance earlier and more definitively. This early clarification will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent discussion and help guide the reader through your reasoning.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay mentions several benefits and concerns associated with GM foods but leans more heavily towards discussing benefits. To create a more balanced argument, consider offering deeper analysis and more concrete examples of the concerns. Furthermore, it's advisable to avoid including specific examples, such as the availability of fruits, when making general statements. This will ensure your argument remains broad and relevant to the wider discussion.

Additionally, while it's vital to present both sides of the argument, ensuring there's a balanced evaluation of pros and cons will more accurately fulfill the prompt's requirements. Currently, the discussion on the disadvantages of GM foods, especially regarding environmental and health concerns, is less developed compared to the advantages. Expanding on these points will enrich your essay and make your argumentation more comprehensive.

In conclusion, you've made a good effort to tackle a complex subject. By refining your focus, enhancing grammar and style, clearly defining your stance, and balancing your discussion, your essay will be significantly strengthened.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion,"Nowadays, environmental issues are the primary concern of the world, since the future of human beings heavily depends on the environmental conditions on Earth. In my opinion, though the extinction of some species of plants and animals are highlighted, there are several other critical environmental problems to be addressed immediately. \n Undeniably, the death of several animals and plants can negatively impact our human life. This is because the natural ecosystems are heavily connected in complex chains, where plants and animals co-live together. When some plants and animals are extinct, the balance in these systems would be broken, endangering other dependent species. Consequently, as the domino effect, mass extinction of many species around the world, which eradicates biodiversity, could be inevitable. Even worse, such imbalance in the ecosystems can also lead to the proliferation of new species that are harmful to human beings, which used to be suppressed by an extinct species in the past. Worldwide pandemic can be an example for the impact of such proliferation. \n However, there are much more urgent and threatening environmental problems to be resolved now, noticeably the heavy pollution and climate change. First, these two problems greatly impact our quality of life. Pollution causes widespread respiratory diseases among people, whereas sudden climate change causes discomfort, irritation or even mental sufferings in our daily life. Second, such environmental problems soon endanger the Earth as a livable place to our future generation. With the current growth rate of population, humans must soon find another livable planet and move a large part of the population there, or must impose cruel methods to reduce the population. \n In conclusion, there are more urgent and critical environmental issues to be addressed immediately for human survival, so the issues of plant and animal extinction should be put at the lower priority.","Your essay comes across as a solely general opinion presentation.

Properly formatting your discussion, based on the outline given in the original prompt will help improve your score. The differentiation of opinion discussions is a must as these are presented separately in the original prompt and not as a general discussion reference.","Final Feedback:

The essay addresses an important topic – environmental issues – which is highly relevant today. However, it's essential to closely follow the prescribed structure for the essay to ensure it fully responds to the topic's requirements. The essay should include a balanced discussion that explicitly acknowledges different perspectives before presenting a personal viewpoint. This structure involves mentioning what ""some people say"" and what ""others believe,"" then concluding with a personal stance. By integrating this format, the essay would not only align more closely with expectations but also provide a clearer presentation of various viewpoints.

Regarding spelling and grammar, there are no significant errors that detract from the overall clarity. Nonetheless, paying close attention to sentence structure and variety can enhance readability and engagement. For stylistic improvements, consider varying sentence lengths and structures to maintain the reader's interest throughout.

The point of view in the essay is clear, presenting a stance that prioritizes other environmental issues over the extinction of plants and animals. However, making the structure of argumentation more transparent by delineating opposing viewpoints, as suggested, would strengthen the essay's effectiveness. 

The arguments made to support this viewpoint are relatively clear and descriptive, particularly the discussion on the impacts of pollution and climate change. These are compelling issues that are well articulated. To improve, focus on providing specific examples or data to support claims, which would add depth and persuasiveness to the arguments. For instance, citing studies or statistics related to pollution's health impacts could reinforce the argument's relevance and urgency. 

Lastly, while it is crucial to express a personal opinion, the essay should strive for a balance between discussing varying perspectives and advocating for a specific viewpoint. This approach not only demonstrates an understanding of the complexity of environmental issues but also showcases critical thinking skills by evaluating different arguments before arriving at a conclusion.

In summary, with a more structured approach to presenting different viewpoints, alongside stylistic enhancements and deeper argumentation, the essay could provide a more compelling and comprehensive discussion on environmental priorities.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

Learning through the internet requires learners who have a basic knowledge about technology to use power-point, join online class, or do the assignment on the internet. Moreover, during studying on the internet, learners have to know the graphics which include icons, symbols, photos, and illustrations to support online learning. For instance, students can try and find a way to make animated videos for their online representation and attract modern learners. On the other hand, traditional learning brings to learners some experiences that e-learning is not.

Traditional learning; however, is not flexible like online learning and making the pupils more difficult to study because of the rigid schedules in colleges and universities. So the students have to arrange their time a suitable way to follow the class. The learners must attend obligatory subjects but they are not convenient.

Here are some suggestions to improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Relevance to Topic**: Your essay addresses a relevant topic, especially given current global circumstances. However, ensure that your essay explicitly responds to the specific question or topic posed. If there was an original prompt, your essay should directly and clearly answer that prompt. Without the original prompt, it's important to maintain a clear focus on comparing online to traditional learning throughout.

2. **Conciseness and Word Choice**: Aim to express your ideas more concisely. This means choosing stronger words and fewer of them. For instance, instead of saying ""have to be affected by..."", consider ""are affected by..."". This makes your writing stronger and clearer. Remember, every word should contribute to your argument or analysis without adding unnecessary bulk to the essay.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are a few areas where grammar and punctuation could be improved to enhance the clarity and professionalism of your essay. For example:
   - Use commas after introductory phrases to help the reader understand where your main idea begins, e.g., ""So, the presidents of schools notice...""
   - Be mindful of semicolon use; it seems like you might have used them in places where a colon or a comma would be more appropriate. For example, ""Traditional learning; however, is not flexible like online learning"" could be ""Traditional learning, however, is not as flexible as online learning.""
   - When using conjunctions to join two independent clauses, include a comma before the conjunction (e.g., ""obligatory subjects, but they are not convenient"").

4. **Argument Structure and Support**: Your essay presents two main distinctions between online and traditional learning, which is a good start. However, to strengthen your argument, ensure that each point you make is supported by clear, specific examples or evidence. Additionally, for every claim or contrast you introduce, consider exploring it further. For example, when discussing the need for basic technology knowledge in online learning, expand on why this is significant and how it contrasts with traditional learning's requirements.

5. **Point of View and Conclusion**: Your point of view becomes clear towards the end of the essay, advocating for online learning. Make sure your conclusion summarizes the key points that led you to this recommendation and reaffirms your stance clearly. A strong closing argument will leave no doubt in the reader's mind about your position and the reasons behind it.

The clarity of the essay's argument and the structure are commendable; however, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

Firstly, the introduction of the essay could be strengthened by adopting a more systematic approach. It begins directly with the topic discussion without properly setting the context or stating a thesis sentence. A stronger opening statement would paraphrase the essay topic and provide an outline of the arguments to follow, ending with a clear thesis sentence. This would guide the reader through your essay more effectively and establish a solid foundation for your arguments.

Regarding the body paragraphs, they each address a distinct reason people engage in dangerous sports, which is good. However, the development of these paragraphs could be enhanced. Each paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences to allow for adequate development of ideas. More specifically, after stating a reason, elaboration with examples, explanations, or personal reflection can further support your argument. Additionally, varying sentence structure and ensuring smooth transitions between paragraphs would improve readability and cohesiveness.

Another area that requires attention is the conclusion. The concluding paragraph should summarize the main points discussed and reiterate the thesis statement in the context of the information presented. Currently, the conclusion introduces new ideas about the potential dangers of participating in these sports, which could distract from the summary of arguments made.

Throughout the essay, there are some minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could be addressed to enhance clarity and engagement. For example, careful proofreading could eliminate errors like ""curiously"" instead of ""curiosity"" and ensure the correct use of articles and prepositions.

Moreover, while the essay does present clear arguments supporting the author’s perspective, providing more detailed examples and personal insights would enrich the content. Exploring the psychological or social implications of seeking danger for thrill or social validation could add depth to the discussion.

Lastly, understanding and adhering to the structure and content requirements of an essay as per English proficiency tests like the IELTS can significantly impact the overall score. Ensure that each paragraph serves its purpose within the essay's structure, from introducing the topic to providing in-depth analysis, and finally, to summarising the main points.

By addressing these areas of improvement, focusing on essay structure, developing arguments more deeply, and refining the essay's grammar and style, there is a significant opportunity to enhance the effectiveness and readability of the essay. Keep practicing, and consider these tips in future essays to improve your writing skills and performance on English proficiency tests.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4303,https://essayforum.com/writing/conversations-person-gradually-replaced-89243/,test,Conversations in person are gradually being replaced by internet communications through social apps,"In the technology-driven world, conversations in person are gradually being replaced by internet communications through social apps such as Facebook, Snapchat..., which has become a controversial issue. Personally, I believe that the drawbacks these technologies have brought might overshadow their benefits. \n In terms of the advantages, social networking sites not only allow us to stay in touch with our loved ones, families and friends but also are places where people can connect and share common interests with anyone from all walks of life. Every day, the internet apps continue to provide new facilities that are immensely convenient with instant access to an endless supply of knowledge. It is undeniable that social media greatly contributes to life, especially in the Corona situation when people can work and study from home without being affected by viruses. \n Sadly enough, social media also reflects an uglier side of society through a number of problems that have shown up for its users. The overuse of these apps causes obesity, shortsightedness, and makes people addicted to their screens all day. Students are likely to neglect their studies due to the appearance of games online, advertisements or even pornographic, prurient, violent and inappropriate contents which exert devastating influences on their development. Moreover, research has shown that users seem to lose their ability to communicate face-to-face with others and even increasingly suffer from depression or xenophobia. Insecurity is also concerned owing to hackers and scammers trying to get money and private information from users. \n In view of what was mentioned above, social media exerts substantial influence nowadays, creates both pros and cons, but somehow the disadvantages win out.","You need to refer to the keyword from the original essay which is ""outweigh"". The missing synonym for this word is what makes your last sentence in the prompt restatement partially incorrect. It would have been better presented as ""The drawbacks of these technologies eclipse / exceed / predominate / outbalance ( synonym words for outweigh) ... \n Your discussion does not provide evidence that would prove your opinion. This is a single opinion essay. So you cannot use the comparative discussion format. Since you say the negatives outweigh the positives, then you need to explain why this is so. There is no clear sense of a discussion that weighs consideration factors in the presentation. Just a continued discussion of a/d, which is different from the ""outweigh"" discussion.","The essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the impact of social media and internet communication, attempting to weigh its benefits against its drawbacks. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make the argument more compelling and responsive to the essay topic.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay topic seems to revolve around whether the disadvantages of internet-based communication outweigh the advantages. However, the presentation does not fully align with the task of discussing whether one aspect ""outweighs"" the other. A more effective approach would have been to directly address how and why the negatives surpass the positives, using phrases like ""the drawbacks of these technologies eclipse the benefits"" to better meet the essay's requirements. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the essay is well-written but could benefit from minor spelling and grammatical corrections. Additionally, varying sentence structure and using a wider range of vocabulary could enhance the essay's readability and engagement.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The point of view is clear; the author believes the cons of social media and internet communication overshadow the pros. However, this viewpoint could be strengthened by presenting a more balanced comparison before concluding that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. This would provide a clearer structure and logical flow to the argument.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: The essay does a good job of listing both the pros and cons of social media. However, it falls short in deeply analyzing why the negatives are more significant than the positives. Incorporating evidence, such as studies or statistical data, to support claims about the negative impacts of social media would make the argument more persuasive. Similarly, providing specific examples of how social media contributes positively could help in making a more balanced initial comparison, thereby making the conclusion that the negatives outweigh the positives more justified.

In summary, to improve this essay, focus on directly addressing how the disadvantages of internet communication outweigh its benefits, both in your thesis statement and throughout the essay. Provide more in-depth evidence and examples to support your claims, and consider improving the essay's readability and engagement through careful grammar checks and stylistic enhancements. Finally, ensure that your arguments clearly support your conclusion, offering a balanced comparison before declaring one side more significant than the other.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative
4304,https://essayforum.com/writing/cbest-contribution-technology-made-modern-life-80527/,test,CBEST: The Contribution Technology Has Made to Modern Life Has Been Positive,"Modern life is often defined as an era of progression. In the center of the modern progression, there is technology. Considering how technology has been used everywhere nowadays, it seems that humans are satisfied with the convenience of using technology. Therefore, it is assumed that the contribution technology has made to modern life has been positive. \n Technology is widely used in various fields, and one of them is medical. Medical technology is directly related to human well-being; the diseases may be treated and the lives may be saved. As well as the treatments of the diseases, humans are expected to live longer than their ancestors, while remaining healthy, by annual check-ups that use technology. The technology already became part of the human lifestyle and have been affected positively to save them. \n Living in Southern California could be challenging sometimes; mainly due to its extremely high temperature during summer. Thankfully, our ancestors have invented the very important appliance, called the air conditioner. The coolness that the air conditioners offer could not be compared to the natural wind, especially during hot summer. Without technology, human beings would not be able to stay away from the unpleasing humidity outside. \n Imagine that you are the teacher in 1800s and you are about to write letters to the parents. If it was the 2010s, then you would have to write it once ---and once only--- and print out multiple copies by using computer technology; however, in 1800s, there is no other choice than writing 30 individual letters by using your hands. The appearance of computer technology helped humans to save time and energy. Thus, computer technology is worthwhile increasing work efficiency by simplifying organizing patterns and saving them as a file. Technology is not only necessary anymore, it became essential to modern life. \n Technology is everywhere and anywhere nowadays. Although humans often fail to realize, we are taking advantages of technology in numerous fields, either intentionally or unintentionally. Expect more positive effects of technology and eager to find more advantages; then you will earn it.","Dear student, while you are doing your practice tests, you can use a thesaurus to vary your word choices. This is the listing of synonyms or words that are different in presentation but have the same meaning. If you had used a thesaurus then you would have known that the variation of the word technology includes automation and machinery, to name a few. You could have also said technical knowledge, scientific knowledge, or scientific know-how. There are various other words that you could have used, depending upon the meaning or topic of your sentence. \n Now, the main problem that I see with this essay is that the prompt asks you to complete a direct action; ""State your position on this issue and support it with appropriate examples."" Rather than stating a direct position using the first person pronoun ""I"", you instead say ""it is assumed."" which begs the reader to ask ""Who is making this assumption?"" Hence the creation of a mistaken response in relation to the given instruction. The correct response would have been ""Therefore, I believe that technology has made modern life more positive."" \n Your reasoning is acceptable enough but the use of the term ""ancestors"" is out of place. Ancestors are a person, typically one more remote than a grandparent, from whom one is descended. I think the more appropriate term would have been ""inventors"" since the air-conditioner is a modern invention of someone unrelated to you. \n It is because of your imprecise details, simplistic reasoning, and problems with word choice that I do not think you can score more than a 2 with this type of CBEST presentation.","This essay offers a thoughtful perspective on the role of technology in modern life, highlighting its extensive use and benefits, particularly in fields such as medicine and daily comfort. However, there are several areas that could be improved to create a more compelling and precise argument.

Firstly, it's essential to directly address the essay prompt. The instruction likely asked for a personal stance on technology's impact on life today. Instead of presenting a general assumption, ""it is assumed,"" it's more effective to use a personal voice, such as ""I believe technology has made modern life more positive."" This approach makes your argument clearer and more persuasive.

To enhance the richness of your essay, vary your vocabulary. Repeated use of the word ""technology"" can be monotonous. Exploring synonyms and related terms, such as ""automation,"" ""machinery,"" ""technical knowledge,"" or ""scientific know-how,"" depending on the context, can make your writing more engaging and demonstrate a broader lexical range. This strategy not only avoids repetition but also adds depth to your discussion.

Regarding word choice and accuracy, the use of ""ancestors"" to refer to those who invented the air conditioner seems misplaced. The term suggests a familial lineage, which may not be the intended meaning. ""Inventors"" is a more appropriate word, accurately attributing the creation of the air conditioner without implying genetic descent.

The essay makes some general claims about the benefits of technology without delving into specific, detailed examples or counterarguments that could enrich the discussion. For instance, while mentioning the role of technology in medicine and comfort during hot weather is a good start, providing concrete examples or statistics would strengthen your argument. Additionally, considering potential drawbacks or challenges related to technology can present a more balanced view and demonstrate critical thinking skills.

Lastly, there are minor spelling and grammatical errors, as well as places where sentences could be more concise or clearer. Paying close attention to language use, and possibly seeking feedback or using tools to check grammar and spelling, can significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of your writing.

In conclusion, focusing on presenting a clear, personal stance on the issue, expanding your vocabulary, ensuring accuracy in word choice, fleshing out your arguments with specific examples, and refining your grammar and spelling will greatly improve the quality of your essays. These changes will help convey your ideas more effectively, making your writing more engaging and persuasive.",4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Although the role of music plays is believed to alleviate high levels of human stress, I strongly agree that working while listening to music also improves working quality. \n On the one hand, there are several compelling reasons explained why music can be seen as a reducing stress method. First and foremost, healing music on any music streaming platform is believed to help listeners more optimistic about life and people, resulting in widespread positive energy. For example, ""Sportify"", a music app with a playlist called "" Heal me"" obviously spread love to the whole listener community so that they can sympathize with the lyrics of the writer and feel peace in their mind. Furthermore, music is considered a great method of curing a social disease such as depression, one of the most prominent in modern society. In terms of medical therapy, wring melodies and lyrics act as an incentive for people to confide the social pressure that they are suffering now, decreasing the rate of depression in all societies. \n On the other hand, it can be denied that music is an ideal place for working. The first one worth mentioning is that listening to music enables people to be more concentrated on their improving the quality of their work and thus achieve higher productivity during the working process. For instance, I used to be loss of concentration during working time, proved to enhance the quality of my work by listening to a concentrated music playlist on the Spotify app. Additionally, listeners themselves may be exposed to a wide range of imaginative ideas from the lyrics song, which is an dispensable for their critical thinking skills. As a result, they may become more receptive to others' opinions as well as more competent at debating to protect their viewpoint. \n In conclusion, the paramount importance of music brings is not only helps ease the pressure that people are burdened but also enhances the performance of working.","You have a presentation over 300 words here.

A 40 minute writing task cannot have this high number of words written. \n The paraphrase + Writer's opinion section of this essay should have only been composed of 2 or 3 sentences. It should not include a discussion deviation as this paragraph does. The change of discussion slant came in with the first sentence written for the presentation.

It should not be in this presentation. \n Using the phrases ""On the one hand"" and ""On the other hand"" refers to different or opposing discussion points in the reasoning paragraphs. It is not used when the reasons presented support the same opinion. Since the writer is strongly giving evidence to show the appropriateness of his opinion, the aforementioned phrases should not be used in either reasoning paragraphs. This would be considered GRA deductions since it caused confusion for the reader who was expecting to read topics that contradict one another. \n As far as the content of the reasoning paragraphs, both reasons are correct and show a clear understanding of the topic provided. There is a wrong reference in the first reason though. The app is called ""Spotify"" not ""Sportify"". While ""Spotify"" is known to the examiner, he will get confused by the ""Sportify"" reference, so that would be an LR deduction. You did correct that reference in the same paragraph, but you did not revise the wrong spelling in the previous reference. Next time, properly edit and revise the paper to increase your scoring marks. \n A conclusion for the task 2 essay is expected to summarize the previous discussion within 2 or more sentences.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to make the essay more effective and aligned with the requirements of an English proficiency test essay.

1. **Essay Length and Clarity**:
   The essay is over 300 words, which while allowing for detailed arguments, also opens the door to more errors. For a task that typically requires efficiency within a limited time frame, aiming for conciseness would help in reducing the risk of making mistakes. A more concise essay would also allow more time for reviewing and revising the content, enhancing its overall quality.

2. **Introduction Section**:
   The introductory paragraph should briefly paraphrase the topic and state your opinion in 2 or 3 sentences. Avoid deviating into a separate discussion or introducing personal opinions not directly tied to the topic. This deviation affects the coherence and relevance of your arguments.

3. **Use of Transitional Phrases**:
   Avoid using ""On the one hand"" and ""On the other hand"" when the paragraphs are not presenting contrasting viewpoints but are instead supporting the same argument. Such phrases mislead the reader to expect contrasting points, causing confusion and potentially leading to deductions on the grading scale.

4. **Spelling and Accuracy**:
   Pay attention to the correct spelling of names and terms, such as ""Spotify."" An incorrect reference, like ""Sportify,"" may confuse readers and impact your lexical resource score. Consistency in spelling is key—always double-check and revise your work to catch such errors.

5. **Content Coherence**:
   The reasons provided in the essay are relevant and demonstrate an understanding of the topic. However, ensure all references and examples used are accurate and properly spelled to maintain credibility and coherence in your argumentation.

6. **Conclusion**:
   The concluding paragraph should effectively summarize the main points discussed in the essay. Aim for at least two sentences that encapsulate your argument clearly, providing a strong closure to your essay. This was not fully achieved in the current essay, which may result in deductions.

7. **Review and Revision**:
   To increase your potential score, it's crucial to thoroughly edit and review your essay. This effort not only corrects possible spelling errors but also enhances the overall structure, coherence, and clarity of your argument.

While the essay is engaging and demonstrates an understanding of the topic, focusing on the above points can significantly improve its effectiveness and alignment with English proficiency test standards.

Take Vietnam as an example, that is, Vietnamese people fought a lot of wars in the past, but now they live peacefully because of some valued experienced that occurred years ago. \n Besides, studying the past of other nations could give the opportunity in terms of knowing more about their society.

It seems the essay slightly deviates from directly addressing the benefits of studying history to students today and the potential negative effects of not including it in the curriculum. Understanding and responding directly to the essay prompt is crucial for a successful essay.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay centers on the significance of learning history, which aligns with discussions about educational content. Nonetheless, it could be improved by directly confronting the question of how students today benefit from learning history and what negative outcomes might arise if they do not. Consider re-framing the essay to directly tackle these points.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay has minor grammatical and stylistic issues that can be smoothed over with careful proofreading. For example, ""it is not wise choice"" should be ""it is not a wise choice."" Additionally, the essay could benefit from varied sentence structures to keep the reader engaged. Avoiding repetition of phrases can also enhance readability.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay clearly opposes replacing history with other subjects in the school curriculum, underscoring the utility of historical knowledge. Strengthen this stance by explicitly stating how excluding history affects students negatively, making your position even clearer.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides some examples and reasons why studying history is beneficial, such as learning from past mistakes and fostering international friendships. Enhance this by adding more specific examples and elaborating on how these historical understandings directly benefit students' present and future. Incorporating the idea that a lack of historical knowledge can lead to negative consequences would also strengthen the argument.

Overall, ensuring the essay directly answers the prompt and clearly articulates the importance of history in education, alongside potential negatives of its absence, would make for a stronger argument.

Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?,"Nowadays, there are more and more people enjoy foreign films instead of local ones. While the theme from foreign firms is more interesting and also the technologies are more fancy, it would have more expenditure on film production which needs government support. \n There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the movie theme is the most important part of the movie. Popular themes such as adventure, magic, and sci-fi usually need more advanced animations with high production costs. Well-known movies such as 'Harry Potter' is one of the examples of vivid animations that lead the audience into a magical world. Secondly, foreign movies often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. By contrast, the poor movie production team would have less possibility to fulfill the film. \n In my opinion, governments should support local film industries financially. Firstly, the casts need funding for training and practice, while talented amateur film-markers also need chances to improve their skills and inspiration. Secondly, the equipment needs to be updated as time goes by, as the old saying 'If a workman wishes to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools.' Both of them need financial support to output high-quality films to attract theatergoers. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment on in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps a rise in tourist numbers. Take 'Cape No.7' for example, Kenting has seen a notable increase in tourism just after the movie was released. \n In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.","You are not very skilled at creating sentences and paragraphs in the English language yet.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the prompt by discussing the reasons people might prefer foreign films and advocating for government financial support for local film production. The opinion is clear, but the introduction to these ideas can be more directly connected to the topic to avoid any confusion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are noticeable issues with sentence structure and coherence that could confuse readers. For example, the phrasing ""Nowadays, there are more and more people enjoy foreign films instead of local ones."" could be improved to ""Nowadays, more and more people enjoy foreign films over local ones."" Paying attention to verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence clarity can significantly enhance readability. It's also helpful to review paragraphs for flow and logical sequence to ensure they build on one another smoothly.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your stance supporting government intervention in the film industry is evident. However, making your thesis statement more pronounced in the introduction will guide readers through your arguments more effectively. Be explicit about your perspective from the beginning to make your point of view unmistakably clear to the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You presented arguments on why local films might be less popular and proposed solutions through government support. These arguments could be strengthened by tightening the connection between ideas and ensuring each paragraph focuses on a single main point. For instance, when discussing the appeal of foreign films due to advanced technology and popular themes, directly linking this challenge to how government support could address these specific gaps in local film production will improve clarity and persuasion.

In terms of actionable feedback:
- Look over each sentence and ask if there's a simpler way to express the same idea that might be easier for all readers to understand.
- Ensure paragraphs flow logically from one idea to the next, which might involve reordering some points or adding transitional phrases.
- Review English grammar basics, particularly focusing on correct verb tenses and subject-verb agreements, to correct grammatical errors.
- Clarify the thesis statement in the introduction and ensure all paragraphs support this main idea.

This essay attempts to shed light on the driving factors behind tendency before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle it. \n There are two primary as why people get into the habit of walking as parts of their daily routine. One reason is that technology is increasingly developing, which leads to people are becoming lazier. For example, companies often have elevators for employees so that they walk less than in the past. Another reason is that people usually abuse certain hi-tech in their lives. For instance, some children often play games or watch videos on YouTube. As a result they have less time to get involved in physical activities. \n To combat this worrying issue, the following essential steps should be taken. Firstly, companies should limit on the usage of elevators in low-rise building. This would encourage people use stairs instead of elevators and develop a habit of walking every day. Secondly, the government should invest money to build infrastructure in order to serve local citizens. For example, exercise tools could be installed in parks, which encourage people to engage in physical activities. Furthermore, the government should also repair sidewalks so people can go to exercise or walk easily and support enough light and security to encourage people use the lane for people go in there. \n In conclusion, there are some underlying motives behind this negative tendency, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures be implemented to deal with this issue.","<quotation>agured</quotation> \n Incorrect word spelling.

Regarding the point about elevators in ""low-rise building,"" the essay would benefit from clarifying what constitutes a low-rise building. Adding a specific definition or range (e.g., buildings with up to 6 floors) would make the argument more precise and understandable.

The essay somewhat struggles with coherence and proffesional writing. For instance, phrases like ""people usually abuse certain hi-tech in their lives"" could be more professionally worded as ""people often overuse advanced technology in their daily lives."" Ensuring that arguments are expressed in a clear, professional manner will strengthen the essay's impact.

The essay outlines some solutions but could further enhance its argumentation. For each proposed solution, expanding on how it would effectively encourage more walking with examples or data could make the argument more compelling and descriptive.

Finally, ensuring grammatical correctness and stylistic appropriateness throughout the essay is essential. This includes maintaining a consistent tense, using appropriate prepositions, and avoiding repetition or overly general statements.

By addressing these points—improving spelling, crafting a succinct thesis statement, clarifying definitions, enhancing coherence and professionalism in writing, and strengthening arguments with more detailed explanations—the essay will significantly improve in quality, making a persuasive and coherent case on the topic.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Many people claimed that authorities should not allow people to take part in these games, while others disagree with this idea. However, I believe that these activities should not be banned \n On the one hand, governments have to ban dangerous games since these ones have a potential risk which players cannot control well. These games require people to have professional skills such as diving, jumping, so forth and practice them in many times. If people cannot meet these requirements, dangerous actions negatively affects on them. Take freediving as an example, to play this game, a gamer should be a diving expert, not an amateur and he needs to know his health condition to be sure the water's pressure not to cause his heart to stop beating. Therefore, to prevent individuals from the death caused by these sports games, authorities require people not to participate in them. \n On the other hand, I argue in favour of the view that harmful sports are only a professional players' choice. People who take part in these actions are experts, they will do things others are afraid of such as jumping from a helicopter or a high mountain. Before doing activities in the outside environment, experts have practiced in harmless places, thus they can manage their actions and conditions. Moreover, they can discover many new places and make various pictures of these views. As a result, we can know more parts of the world where we will never go to. \n In my opinion, politicians just need to alert people to be careful when playing these games. Comparing with driving carelessly on the streets, they are not as a serious problem as causing people's injuries to be limited \n To conclude, there is a beneficial effect on prohibiting harmful sports. However, I strongly contend that playing these games is an individual's choice which the government cannot restrict","In your reasoning paragraphs, you cannot start the second presentation with ""I argue"" because you have yet to present the second public point of view reasoning discussion. Whether you support it or not, you have to use a third person point of view at this point. You can only present your agreement int he 3rd reasoning section, which is your personal point of view discussion. You cannot have two personal points of view. Analyze the essay discussion requirement, it asks you to discuss both points of view (public) and then your personal (private) point of view so the statement format for the reasoning presentation is: \n - Public 1 \n - Public 2 \n - Personal \n Additionally, these essays are never debates or arguments. These are just discussions so do not use inflammatory terms such as ""argue or debate"". Simply indicate that you support or agree with the previous paragraph because (present your discussion topic). Elaborate on your reason within that paragraph. You do not need 2 paragraphs to do that. You end up writing the essay in the wrong format. Always count the discussion paragraphs and write it based on the points of view that need to be presented on an individual basis. \n Use topic sentences to start your paragraphs instead of filler phrases like ""on the one hand"" or ""on the other hand"". These work well towards fulfilling the word count, but does not help to deliver a clearer explanation or a cohesive discussion. An example of your direct topic sentence is: \n <em>Governments have to ban dangerous games since these ones have a potential risk which players cannot control well.</em> \n Use a transition sentence at the end of the paragraph to help create a cohesive / connected transition from one paragraph to the next. For example. The previous paragraph could have ended with: \n <em>However, people who have been trained to participate in these sports should be able to safely perform the dangerous activities.</em> \n That sentence alone connects the existing paragraph to the next which you started with the connected discussion topic: \n <em>People who take part in these actions are experts...</em> \n Do you see how the transition sentence in the previous paragraph clearly indicates the transition to the next discussion topic? That is the coherence that the examiner will be looking for in your writing. The ability to properly reflect the connection between reason 1 and reason 2. \n Additionally, your 3rd reasoning paragraph is too short. It does not contain a properly developed explanation and does not really prove a point. This happened because you tried to present 2 personal points of view, when only one is required. \n The concluding paragraph is lacking in content. You gave a personal opinion without doing the following first: \n - A 2nd version of the topic restatement \n - A presentation of the 2 public pov \n - Closing with a restatement of your personal point of view \n As of now, I am focusing solely on the format errors in your essay for now because you need to make sure that you have the proper essay response presentation before anything else is considered. All the other grammar and vocabulary errors can wait to be corrected. We need to focus on your English comprehension skills first, clarity of your discussion second, and everything else third. The last part, the grammar and LR sources, are the least of your problems .","The essay on high-risk sports presents a relevant discussion aligned with the topic. However, to enhance its clarity and effectiveness, several adjustments are needed. Firstly, the structure of the essay should follow a clear format that distinguishes between the public viewpoints and the author's personal opinion. Instead of starting the second part of the discussion with ""I argue,"" it's essential to present the second public viewpoint neutrally. The essay should be organized as follows: firstly, explaining one public viewpoint, then another, and finally, introducing your personal perspective. 

Moreover, the language used in the essay should not imply a heated debate. Phrases like ""I argue"" could be replaced with more neutral expressions that indicate support or agreement, thus keeping the tone of a discussion rather than an argument. 

Additionally, the use of topic sentences is crucial for starting paragraphs. Phrases such as ""on the one hand"" or ""on the other hand"" are less effective than direct statements that clearly convey the main idea of the paragraph. For instance, stating ""Governments have to ban dangerous games due to uncontrollable risks"" directly addresses the point. 

In terms of coherence and flow between paragraphs, consider using transition sentences that link the ideas from one section to the next, ensuring a logical progression in the argumentation. 

The third reasoning paragraph appears underdeveloped, which impacts the overall strength of the essay. It's important to fully articulate your personal viewpoint here, supported by clear and compelling reasons. 

The conclusion also requires expansion. It should restate the essay topic, summarize the public viewpoints discussed, and clearly reiterate your own stance. This will offer a rounded and complete end to the discussion.

Focusing on comprehending the English language, expressing ideas clearly, and then gradually addressing grammar and vocabulary will significantly improve the quality of the essay. Remember, the primary goal is to present a coherent and logically structured discussion that effectively communicates your perspectives on the topic.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

While a sizeable percentage of people hold the view that those modern devices bring numerous benefits to youthes, others point out that young generations are getting into several troubles due to their adverse effects.

Moreover, with several services of modern technology, young people can do anything easier such as booking flight, seeking jobs or shopping online everywhere thank to their portability. Especially, they help everyone relax through applications of videos,books,music,etc. \n On the other hand, we cannot deny that numerous serious consequences have been caused as a result of sharply technology development . First and foremost, the regulary using of smart devices has made numerous teenagers become addicted. They spend their whole time on them and get serious health problems like obesity or having short-sighted eyes. Secondly, the information from these devices is not always right and suitable for toung people. This can lead to wrong mental life and activities , which is very dangerous to their future. For example, over 100 Russian teenagers were died in 2016 as they joined the a risky challenge they saw on their devices called Blue Whale. In addition, there are a large number of bad applications which can leak private information or scam money. The personal life is also difficult to be projected as bad people can post any right or wrong news to social network and internet. \n In conclusion, althogh technological devices have several disadvantages, as long as there are parental supervision and teenagers'cafulness, it is safe to use them as their wonderful benefits.","Please do your best to limit your discussion presentation to within 275-290 words.

It effectively covers both the positive and negative aspects, which is an excellent approach for a balanced argument. However, there are several aspects that need improvement to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of your essay. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** You've chosen a relevant topic and discussed both sides of the argument, which is good. However, make sure every point directly supports your main argument to keep the essay focused and cohesive.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""youthes"" should be ""youth,"" ""abudant"" should be ""abundant,"" ""regulary"" should be ""regularly"") and issues with punctuation and spacing (e.g., there should not be a space before a period and always put a space after a comma). These errors can distract from your message. Avoid using informal expressions like ""etc."" in formal essays. It’s important to proofread your essay multiple times to catch and correct these errors, focusing on accuracy and simplicity rather than length.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your position is clear, but your argument could be strengthened by more succinctly stating your stance in the introduction and conclusion. This clarity helps guide the reader through your argumentation.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You provide several examples to support your points, which is great. However, focusing on providing more depth to fewer examples can make your arguments stronger and more impactful. Additionally, ensure the information shared is accurate and relevant.

Remember, quality over quantity in essay writing. A shorter, well-written essay is preferable to a longer essay with numerous errors. Prioritize clarity, coherence, and the correct use of English grammar and vocabulary. It's also beneficial to familiarize yourself further with English writing rules to avoid common mistakes.

Some people think that the computer is the most important invention of the last century. While others have different opinions. The essay supports the former idea that there are not other inventions more important than the computer. Firstly, the essay will discuss the convenience that the computer provides us with and secondly, discuss how the computer eliminates manual work. \n Computers are used everywhere we can imagine since they bring us lots of conveniences. Customers use shopping websites or smartphone applications to buy whatever they want online. Browsing goods on the computer is much easier than driving to the shopping mall. Many young people do not know how to cook a meal. And ordering meals on the computer is an alternative. Years ago, we communicated with each other through letters. Now we use instant messager like Facebook, Wechat. No waiting is needed anymore. It can be drawn that computers have made our life more convenient than years ago in many aspects. \n The computer is originally designed to deal with complex calculations that are used to be done by people. Calculating is a tiring and complex job. People often make mistakes doing such a job all day. Computers surely free us from tough calculation problems. After years of development, computers are able to do more difficult things now. Computers can control machines to produce goods without human guidance. In addition, advanced techniques like image recognition and automatic driving are also running on computers. Lots of tasks used to be done by the human now can be completed by computers. \n In conclusion, there is no doubt that the computer is the most essential invention in the last 100 years since it not only makes our life convenient but also reduces lots of manual and complex tasks.","By using a mix of singular and plural ownership pronouns (Me, myself, I, We, Our, for example) you would have boosted your overall score because you would have written a good mix of simple and complex presentations that highlight your ability to use various LR sources and also, prove that you have a good grasp of how to compose an effective English sentence. You could have used singular first person pronouns in the first body paragraph, then plural first person pronouns in the second paragraph to better highlight your grammar range accuracy and abilities. \n By the way, your final paragraph is a run-on sentence. Please avoid using long sentences that combine two ideas in one. That affects your GRA score. One idea per sentence please. That helps to increase the C&C scoring consideration for your essay as well. After all, the requirement for the concluding paragraph is a restatement of the discussion you provided in the body of paragraphs along with the topic for discussion and your opinion. \n Good work on this essay. You are well on your way to achieving an above average band-score at this rate.","This essay effectively addresses the topic by arguing that computers are the most important invention of the last century. However, to enhance the essay and make it stronger, consider the following points:

1. **Direct Response to the Topic:** The essay clearly supports the idea that the computer is a vital invention, showing a strong alignment with the prompt. The introduction prepares the reader well for the discussion. To improve, ensure that the thesis statement is even more direct, briefly highlighting the key reasons that will be discussed.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are minor issues with grammar and style. For instance, varying sentence structure and using a mix of singular and plural pronouns can make the writing more dynamic. Instead of sticking to one form, try using singular first-person pronouns ('I', 'my') in one paragraph and plural forms ('we', 'our') in another. This change will showcase your ability to handle complex grammar structures, making your essay more engaging.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The point of view is clear throughout the essay; it firmly supports the importance of computers. However, incorporating personal experiences or observations could enrich the narrative and strengthen your stance.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The arguments presented are clear and relevant. They effectively support the claim that computers have significantly impacted society. Improve by adding more descriptive examples or statistics to bolster the argument further. Instead of general statements, offer specific examples of how computers have transformed daily tasks or industries.

5. **Run-on Sentences and Clarity:** Be cautious of run-on sentences, especially in the concluding paragraph. Aim to express one idea per sentence. This will not only make your essay easier to read but will also help in clearly conveying your points. Remember, the conclusion should succinctly restate your main arguments and reaffirm your standpoint without introducing new information.

Overall, the essay is on a promising path toward achieving a strong score. By incorporating these suggestions, focusing on variety in grammar usage, avoiding run-on sentences, and enriching the argument with more detailed examples, the essay will become more coherent, compelling, and grammatically diverse.

Although people put a premium on salary in the workforce, I do not agree that money is the most essential reason as there are still some other elements that motivate people to stay in the workforce. \n On the one hand, we can understand why money is an important factor. Money is an element that people notice when they apply for a job. More specifically, they are likely to look for a well-paid job and offer a high salary, and those who do that tend to stay in the workforce for a long time. In addition, people go to work to make money because it is needed for their daily life such as houses, clothes, food, and transportation. As a result, a high salary is a necessary element to have loyal staff. \n Nevertheless, there are also several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce. Firstly, the environment and association in the workplace can affect people's work. Specifically, a place that has many arguments between co-workers, or the boss's criticism can influence the staff's productivity, and those lead them to leave a job. Secondly, people also decide to stay in the workforce based on their feelings as well as their passions. Take musicians and composers as an example, creativity and achievement in their field are more important than money, so money does not matter to them either stay or leave. \n Overall, I disagree that money is the most important reason to stay in the workforce while there are some factors such as association, passions, and feelings that are also important.","The writer has not provided an originally worded prompt topic restatement.

His opinion also does not represent the correct emotional or measured response as required by the discussion question. He did respond using an agree or disagree format but he did not provide the degree of response that is required. So he can only get low marks for this semi compliant opinion presentation. \n His opinion is not properly supported in the discussion paragraphs since he used a comparative discussion and tried to provide reason for the opposing opinion, which ran counter to his provided opinion. As such the essay will be seen as improperly discussed / developed and will lose points due to this incorrect discussion format.","Your essay attempts to address the topic of what motivates people to stay in the workforce, suggesting that elements beyond money, such as the work environment, passion, and personal satisfaction, play significant roles. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test.

Firstly, it is important to restate the topic in your own words at the beginning of your essay. This demonstrates your understanding of the topic and your ability to express it in original language. Your introduction closely mirrors the prompt language, which may make it seem like you haven't fully developed your own understanding of the topic. Try to paraphrase the essay prompt more distinctly to show a deeper engagement with the question.

Regarding the structure of your argument, while it's commendable that you explored both sides of the argument (the importance of money versus other motivating factors), your essay would benefit from a clearer stance that is consistently supported throughout. The discussion seems to alternate between the significance of money and other factors without a firm position. When you state your opinion, it's crucial to back it up with specific, convincing examples and reasons throughout your essay. This will also help in making your point of view clearer and more convincing to the reader.

Grammatically and stylistically, your essay is generally well-composed. However, watch out for repetitive phrases and try to vary your language more. For instance, instead of repeatedly saying ""people stay in the workforce,"" you could use synonyms or rephrase it as ""individuals remain employed"" to add variety to your essay.

Your arguments would be strengthened by providing more concrete examples and elaborating on your points. For example, while you mention that passion and the work environment can motivate people, adding detailed scenarios or real-life examples would make your argument more relatable and persuasive.

Finally, it's crucial to conclude your essay by summarizing your main points and restating your opinion in a powerful way, helping to leave a lasting impression on the reader. Though you do conclude with a brief summary, expanding on how your points support your stance could further solidify your argument.

Overall, your essay touches on essential aspects of what motivates people in their jobs, but focusing on clearer argumentation, originality in presenting your thoughts, and providing strong support for your views will enhance the quality of your writing.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

I completely agree with the opinion that overseas education should be promoted from the perspectives of students and universities. \n Students who study abroad for a semester or a few years can be benefited in several different ways. For those who spend a semester abroad, they can have access to academic resources that couldn't be obtained at their home university. For example, architecture students who are interested in flood risk adaptation may join a laboratory or take courses at a university in the Netherlands, where the most innovative technologies and research related to this topic come from. Furthermore, studying at a foreign university means meeting classmates from diverse cultural backgrounds. Students could enhance their ability of cross-cultural communication by exchanging opinions and discussing in class. Lastly, if students are dedicated to obtaining a foreign degree by spending 4 years in another country, for instance, they will not only grow intellectually. They may leave their comfort zone and learn how to settle down in a totally new environment, and therefore gain experience in tackling numerous obstacles in life independently. \n When universities are welcoming students from a variety of countries, they can also take advantage in two aspects. Firstly, it is crucial for the university to pursue cultural diversity nowadays in the context of globalization. Receiving foreign students could lead to a more international academic environment that fosters new ideas, while local students mingle with people and knowledge from all over the world. Secondly, universities can improve the quality of students by accommodating talented students from other countries. If there are more motivated and intelligent foreign students, it thus becomes a valuable chance for the university to advertise itself on the global education stage. \n In conclusion, it is certain that an international academic environment benefits both the students and schools for learning and generating knowledge if overseas education is encouraged.","Do not alter the orginal discussion foundation by presenting your opinion in the first paragraph that will make it fail the prompt restatement requirements.

By immediately discussing your opinion, the examiner will have to partially lower the score for that section. Something that will not be good when the sectional scores are added up. \n The writer's opinion will also get a lower score because of the incorrect presentation format.

While it presents a clear stance and offers detailed arguments to support this position, there are areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to test requirements.

1. **Response to Topic:** The introduction immediately shares a personal viewpoint rather than closely restating the discussion points using synonyms for the original ideas. For better alignment with the essay prompt, start with a neutral presentation of the topic before introducing the personal stance. This approach will ensure the essay fully meets the task's requirements.

2. **Presentation of Opinion:** The presentation of the personal opinion could be adjusted to better fit the standardized discussion format. Instead of adopting a highly enthusiastic tone, maintain a measured and straightforward expression of your views. This will help match the expected response style for such essays, avoiding potential penalties in scoring.

3. **Content and Structure:** The essay does an excellent job in the body paragraphs, providing comprehensive reasons and effectively defending them. The connections between ideas are clear, and the supportive arguments are well-developed. However, aim to be more concise. The essay's length—exceeding the typical word count—might pose challenges for completion within a given timeframe and could impact the overall test performance.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement:** To refine your essay:
   - Rewrite the introduction to first neutrally introduce the topic before presenting your stance, closely mirroring the language of the prompt.
   - Adopt a more reserved and straightforward tone when sharing your personal views, aligning with the expectations of a discussion essay.
   - Streamline your examples and arguments to ensure that the essay can be comfortably written within the exam's time limit, targeting a word count of around 275-300 words. This will not only make your essay more focused but also increase your chances of achieving a higher score.

5. **Technical Aspects:** On the whole, your essay is free from significant spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. Nevertheless, always proofread your work to catch and correct minor errors, ensuring your essay remains polished and professional.

In my perception, this problem stems from various reasons, and it is more serious than most people think because it is detrimental to society. \n In general, it is undeniable that technology plays a vital role in our lives. However, there are several compelling reasons why I argue that it has demerits for our society. First and foremost, if students enroll in these courses, they won't have any R&D activities. Specifically, most factories focus solely on assembly and production. Therefore, industrial occupations cannot become innovative, which leads employees to be underpaid. Following that, the public won't have a clear understanding of science. If people do not appreciate science, there will be an ignorant and distrustful society. According to the study, teens in America were more likely to fall for conspiracy theories, like the flat-earth or the anti-vaccine movements. \n In addition, this problem stems from different reasons. Primarily, studying science subjects will narrow your future career path. Based on current salaries, states and companies do not pay enough for scientists, and lab technicians. This problem will affect students ' motivation. Also, the way universities teach science is too boring and rusting. For example, teachers always focus too much on math and complex problems that do not have many applications, little interactivity in class, outdated information, and labs, which is why enrollment in science majors is dropping. \n To conclude, it is reasonable to understand why many students choose not to enroll in science majors at higher-education levels. However, the lack of science in society might be attributed to rising underdeveloped countries and people's lack of knowledge.","<quotation>Despite the fact that science has made great strides in the past few decades,</quotation> \n This is a writer's personal opinion.

To improve clarity and effectiveness, consider the following points:

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay addresses the topic, presenting an argument about the significance of science subjects and the consequences of their decline in popularity. However, the introduction can be more directly related to the essay's main claim. Instead of beginning with general statements about science's advancements, directly state your main argument and the reasons you will discuss. This approach helps readers understand your position from the beginning.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is mostly free from spelling and grammatical errors. Yet, the writing could benefit from a conciser style. Avoid overly complex sentences and word fillers that do not add value to the argument. For instance, instead of saying ""Despite the fact that,"" simply use ""Although"" or ""Despite."" This makes your writing more straightforward and powerful.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your point of view comes across clearly but could be strengthened with more direct statements. For example, when expressing an opinion, ensure it is categorically placed within the context of your argument. Instead of leading with a personal view on science's strides, directly state your stance on the preference for computer-based subjects to align with your subsequent points.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides arguments supporting the view that moving away from science subjects is detrimental, such as the lack of R&D activities and the public's growing ignorance of science. However, these arguments would be more compelling with precise examples and data. Moreover, the reasoning can be better structured. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main argument of the paragraph, followed by supporting details. Avoid starting paragraphs with broad statements.

5. **Constructive Introduction and Conclusion**: The introduction and conclusion sections play crucial roles in framing your essay. Begin with a direct statement about the issue at hand, followed by a brief overview of your reasons. Likewise, conclude by summarizing the key points made throughout the essay and the implications or suggestions for addressing the issue.

6. **Avoid Generalizations**: Be cautious of making sweeping generalizations, such as the assertion that studying science narrows career paths. Instead, offer balanced viewpoints or acknowledge exceptions to present a well-rounded argument.

By addressing these aspects, the essay can become more persuasive and engaging. Focusing on direct, clear expression of ideas and providing specific, well-supported arguments will significantly enhance the overall quality of the essay.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

The solution to this problem.,"There is no denying that the number of obesity in humans is increasing dramatically day by day. according to experts, the solution is to impose a higher price on fast foods. To some extent, I agree that this is a brilliant suggestion, while I also believe that this isn't the only way that we could think of. \n It is true that rising food prices tend to create hesitation when a person is about to purchase it. In light of economic hardship, people need to consider carefully before any payment because money doesn't grow on trees. And when it comes to fast food which is obviously not human stable food, consumers will probably choose to not buy it anymore once the cost is increased. another explanation for the mentioned fact is that people are accustomed to buying fast food at an affordable price. This sudden change is likely to curb the craving for junk food among eaters. \n However, pushing the price is not the only solution that we could come up with. One another viable remedy that I could think of immediately is to raise the awareness within individuals about a healthy and fitness body. For instance: encouraging citizens to exercise daily or go to the gym if they are not able to do it themselves. Exercising or gym is not only helps overweight people to get their desired body but also improves their health from the inside. For example, running, swimming is both great ways to burn fat and build muscle while bicycling makes your legs more flexible. \n All in all, there are various recommendations to reduce the seriousness of overweight that people can refer to alongside increasing the fee. That said, humans' consciousness is still the most crucial factor in the process. In conclusion, I'd like to send to all the fat people out there: what you need to do right now is to forget about that bowl of French fries and get up, do something active and be more patient with the result","The writer has not provided a simple restatement of the topic. When rewriting the topic presentation, the personal opinion presentation or any other information reference must be avoided as it changes the original topic projection. When the topic representation carries added information, the examiner will have no choice but to reduce the possible score for that section since it is no longer in accordance with the original content presentation. \n <quotation>To some extent, I agree that this is a brilliant suggestion</quotation> \n <quotation>while I also believe that this isn't the only way that we could think of.</quotation> \n The extent response is correct but not properly formatted for the presentation. Consider that the second half appears to run counter to the measured response and you will understand why the score will be faced with deductions. Had the writer framed this as "" I agree that this is a brilliant suggestion to the extent that this isn't the only way..."" then the writer's opinion + thesis statement would not appear to be contradicting each other. \n The concluding paragraph must not contain additional discussion presentations anymore. It must only restate the topic, writer's opinion, and reasoning subjects. When new information is included, it will not be given a score and will instead, force deduction upon the concluding paragraph due to incorrect discussion format problems.","The essay addresses the topic of increasing obesity rates and suggests raising fast food prices as a possible solution. However, the essay also presents additional ideas for combating obesity. While engaging with the topic, the introduction could be improved by clearly restating the topic without adding personal opinion or extra information, which can divert from the original topic and potentially lower the score.

Firstly, there's a commendable attempt to engage with the topic by suggesting an increase in fast food prices could reduce obesity rates. This argument is supported by reasoning that higher prices may deter people from purchasing fast food, a point that aligns well with the topic. The suggestion to raise awareness about healthy lifestyles as another solution shows an understanding that the issue is multifaceted. However, these arguments need clearer separation and more depth to effectively support the claim.

Regarding language use, there are several areas for improvement:
- The opening sentence lacks proper capitalization (""according to experts...""), which is also seen with ""another explanation..."" These errors can distract readers and impact the essay's professionalism.
- There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (""humans' consciousness is still the most crucial factor in the process"") that hinder clarity.
- The concluding call to action (""I'd like to send to all the fat people out there..."") could be perceived as insensitive. It's crucial to maintain a respectful and objective tone throughout.

The essay's structure needs refinement. Each paragraph should focus on developing a single main idea. The transition between supporting higher fast food prices and suggesting alternative solutions like promoting exercise is a bit abrupt. A smoother transition and a more detailed exploration of each point would strengthen the argument.
The conclusion should succinctly restate the essay's key points without introducing new information. The current conclusion introduces new ideas, which distracts from summarizing and reinforcing the essay's main arguments.

To improve the essay:
- Begin by restating the topic clearly and concisely in the introduction, following the prompt closely.
- Use precise and respectful language throughout the essay to maintain objectivity and professionalism.
- Enhance the structure by clearly separating and developing each argument with more detailed explanations and examples.
- Improve upon spelling, grammar, and punctuation to ensure the essay is easy to read and understand.
- Ensure the conclusion effectively summarizes the essay without adding new information.

The attempt to explore the reasons behind and solutions to this problem is appreciated. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and alignment with expectations for a structured essay response.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay focuses on internet-related identity theft, which is a significant issue. However, it narrowly misses discussing identity theft in its broader spectrum. Identity theft can occur through various means, not just via the internet. A wider perspective on the topic, including non-technical methods of identity theft, would comply more thoroughly with the essay prompt and give a comprehensive view of the subject.

2. **Structure and Formatting**: An ideal educational essay should be structured into clear paragraphs, typically including an introduction, body paragraphs (each discussing a separate idea), and a conclusion. Each paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences to maintain clarity and coherence. The introduction should ideally include a restatement of the topic, a brief mention of the causes of identity theft, and its effects. Similarly, the conclusion should succinctly summarize your discussion. This format helps in organizing thoughts more logically and makes the essay easier to follow.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several instances of grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward phrasing (""strongly development of the Internet"", ""identify theft"", ""earning from a grant source of information""). Careful proofreading is needed to correct these mistakes. It might also help to simplify the language to enhance the essay's readability and ensure the intended message is effectively communicated.

4. **Clarity of Argument**: While the essay attempts to articulate causes and solutions to identity theft, the points occasionally lack depth and specificity. For a stronger argument, it's crucial to clearly define and elaborate on each reason and solution mentioned. For example, more specific examples of how identity theft occurs and detailed, actionable solutions would enrich the essay. Moreover, directly linking each cause and effect will fortify the argument's coherence.

5. **Point of View**: The essay's point of view is somewhat evident but could be made clearer by directly stating the personal stance in the introduction and maintaining it consistently throughout. Asserting a clear thesis in the beginning will guide the narrative and make it more persuasive.

In conclusion, focusing on structuring the essay with clear, defined paragraphs, broadening the discussion beyond internet-related theft, enriching the content with specific details, and improving language accuracy will significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness.

For example, in the US, Almost elementary pupils have been equipped with chocolate bars or soft drinks while they go to school, and they argue that it has become a popular trend or even a habit on a daily basis. In addition, Advertisement exerts a great influence on purchasing and using rich in high glycemic items.

Unfortunately, companies producing sugary drinks create plenty of advertising posts through Facebook and Youtube which are regarded as one of the most prevalent websites have a lot of interest in children. \n However, high-glycemic drinks are more likely to pose serious health implications such as diabetes or hypertension therefore governments need to adopt a number of viable solutions to deal with this problem. First and foremost, authorities should exert pressure on the producer in this field by increasing the tax of sugary products, this can decline the levels of production of drinks containing too much sugar. One particular example in France, the government has raised the tax in the production of soft drinks year-on-year, resulting in pushing up the price of soft drink items to restrict the demands of consumers. Second, state subsidies that should be invested to encourage their citizens can cut down using sugary drinks by informing some serious effects via newspapers or social media or organizing some health-related events in the universities or academic institutions. \n In conclusion, the habits of young people's lifestyles and advertisements in order to maximize profits are two main reasons for using more and more soft drinks.

Instead of alluding to a broad argument or discussion, it is essential to directly address the specific questions presented by the essay prompt. A more precise paraphrase of the prompt at the beginning could strengthen the foundation of the essay.

As far as I am concerned, while local history lessons are crucial to children's development, world history could also benefit them a lot. \n There are many reasons why children are made to learn their national history. Firstly, teenagers can understand their indigenous history carefully such as significant historical events and famous heroes who protected their countries, which helps them adjust their behavior to fit the society they live in. For example, by learning native history, schoolchildren will respect their ancestors as well as express their gratitude toward their parents and grandparents. Another reason why national history is mandatory in schools is young generations can draw lessons from the process of protecting and constructing their countries of their ancestors. Using this knowledge, youngsters can deter their nations from making similar mistakes in the past and also make their countries prosper by experience collected from the past. \n On the other hand, young people can also gain many benefits from learning world history. It is an inevitable fact that by studying history, learners can acquire more knowledge about other nations in various aspects. Due to the close relation between history and indigenous cultures, teenagers can have a deeper insight into customs and traditions of other areas. As a result, a deep understanding of historical situations and cultures can prevent students from offending local values when travelling to other nations. Furthermore, studying world history can provide young people with experience to develop their countries. For example, the underdeveloped nations can imitate other prosperous countries such as following their educational curriculum or strategies to make their own nations flourish in an effective way. \n In conclusion, I believe that native history and world history should be taught all over the world because they are of the same importance.","Dear student, why are you discussing a compare and contrast essay when you are being asked to represent your personal opinion on a specific matter?

The response suggests that while native history is crucial, world history also offers substantial benefits. However, the essay's approach diverges from the expectations of the provided prompt, which affects its overall effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of feedback aimed to improve the essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay mixes a compare and contrast approach with personal opinion. Though the essay attempts to weigh the importance of national versus world history, it misses explicitly stating a clear stance in response to an implied prompt's requirement to argue one side predominantly. A more focused response, clearly outlining a position with regard to prioritizing native history or world history based on the prompt, is necessary.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay is generally well-written with minor issues. However, it would benefit from varying sentence structure and more precise word choices to enhance clarity and engagement. Ensuring punctuation is correctly used (like commas and semicolons) can also improve readability.

3. **Author's Point of View:** The perspective is that both native and world histories are of equal importance, which conflicts with the need to take a definitive stand as the essay task requires. Specifying one aspect as more pivotal and supporting it with compelling reasons would align better with the task's expectations.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay includes arguments for the value of learning both national and world history, with examples to illustrate points. To improve, ensure that the arguments directly support the author's main position. It's also vital to avoid introducing new information in the conclusion, as it can confuse readers about the essay's main arguments and stance. The conclusion should succinctly summarize the discussion and reinforce the author's viewpoint without adding new details.

Lastly, it's crucial for the conclusion to effectively encapsulate the essay's discussion and reiterate the author's opinion without introducing new information. A clear, concise summation that echoes the essay's core argument strengthens the overall coherence and leaves the reader with a definitive understanding of the author's stance.

I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay. \n To begin with, a big city centralizes a vast number of schools and cultural facilities. Children have more opportunities in determining a good education from primary schools to universities in urban areas; the key for children to approach a brighter future. My own experience is a compelling example of this. I lived in a big city, the capital of the country, where I have studied for eighteen years but no need to move out of the city.

From the stories which I have heard in my life, the children live more beneficial in a big city than a small town. \n In conclusion, I always believe that children need to grow in cities than rural areas.

However, there are several areas where this work could be improved for clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, the introduction does convey the topic but lacks a clear statement on the type of discussion (e.g., comparison, opinion). It's essential to directly state whether you're comparing urban versus rural upbringing or solely advocating for one side. Also, phrases like ""I will explore in the following essay"" are repetitive and don't showcase a range of grammatical structures. Try to vary your sentence structures to enhance readability and engagement.

The essay does well to present personal experiences and observations as evidence, but the argumentation could be strengthened by contrasting these points with potential downsides or challenges of urban living, providing a balanced view. This approach would not only lend credibility to your reasoning but also demonstrate a logical and coherent thought process in English.

Regarding grammar and style, there are some issues that need addressing:
- Consistency in verb tenses (""has"" should be ""have"" in ""children who live in a big city has more chance"")
- Article usage (""the countryside keeps"", ""a good education"")
- Spelling and punctuation, particularly in the conclusion (""in cities than rural areas"" could be clearer as ""in cities rather than in rural areas"").

Your conclusion is brief and could be expanded to effectively encapsulate the essay's main points. Rather than summarizing briefly and stating a personal belief, aim to summarize both the educational and healthcare advantages discussed, and then conclude by reinforcing why these factors make urban living beneficial for children. A nuanced conclusion that reflects upon the entirety of your discussion will leave a stronger impression on the reader.

Finally, the clarity of your viewpoint is apparent; however, offering a comparison or acknowledging counterarguments, even if to refute them, would enrich your discussion. As it stands, the essay strongly leans towards personal opinion without fully engaging with potential counterpoints.

While it is important for parliaments to take the initiative, I strongly believe that people's role in tackling these issues is indispensable due to their significant impacts on nature. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that it is the responsibility of politicians to tighten regulations on environmental problems and take the initiative in this journey. Since they are given the power to make changes to the law, any of their actions would have significant impacts on the behaviors of citizens which directly affect the surrounding environment. For instance, if the Ministry of Environment applied strictly financial punishment on people who cut down trees illegally, they would be afraid and stop their crime. Furthermore, as politicians are considered role models for residents, them taking the initiative would raise awareness among the vast majority of people about the necessity of natural preservation. This can be seen in many Vietnamese new schools, when the city council sent a tree to these schools as a gift, it has started to influence students to grow more plants on their campus. Such small actions, as a result, might lead to considerable improvements in the environment in the future. \n On the other hand, an individual's role in solving this issue is part and parcel given their huge impacts on nature. This could be explained by the fact that apart from politicians, the rest of us make up nearly 100% of the world population. Consequently, even an insignificant action like littering a plastic bag, combined with tons of other bags being thrown away around the globe can devastate the entire ecosystem. In fact, the deterioration in the environment these days is also the aftermath of irresponsible exploitation and usage of natural resources as well as inhumane wars happening for centuries just for the convenience of humans' lives. As a result, only unity and precise awareness among every individual worldwide can resolve these natural issues. \n Based on the aforementioned points, while politicians can partly tackle the problems by tightening environmental regulations, it is mainly individuals' actions that have huge impacts on nature. I am also convinced that as soon as people are fully aware of their roles and willing to take serious steps, the environment would be improved. \n 387 words","Why is the writer constantly changing the presentation slant of the original prompts?

1. **Response to the Topic**: It's important that your essay directly addresses the question or statement provided in the prompt. In your case, while you've discussed the roles of both governments and individuals, ensure that your response clearly aligns with the original prompt's focus. Instead of introducing new angles or debates, concentrate on directly agreeing or disagreeing with the statement, followed by your reasons. This will help avoid any deviation from the topic and ensure your essay is considered responsive to the prompt.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: While your essay is structured with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is excellent, ensuring the clarity of your stance throughout is crucial. Instead of indirectly stating your viewpoint, start with a clear thesis statement that reflects your position in relation to the prompt. This helps in maintaining a coherent argument throughout your essay.

3. **Word Count and Conciseness**: Your essay is almost 400 words, which indicates a good effort in elaborating your points. However, it's essential to remember that proficiency tests evaluate quality and comprehension, not just the quantity of words. Aim for concise sentences and paragraphs that directly contribute to your argument.

In my perspective, this propensity can reduce urban pressure and lower business costs, while firms themselves may encounter stumblocks associated with recruitment and market access. \n To begin with, relocating organizations to rural areas eases tensions from increased population. In fact, through this action, authorities can alleviate traffic congestion, housing shortages, and infrastructure strain in cosmopolitan cities due to the dramatic expanse of inhabitants. Another merit is that operating costs including rent, labor, and overhead in non-populated regions are usually a real bargain. This is because of the lack of awareness from land purchasers as well as a small number of residents living there. Therefore, enterprises and institutions can make use of them to cut down their budget on these costs significantly and lean towards enhancing products' quality and sustainable development. \n Nevertheless, this trend may prevent associations in regional places from seeking or retaining talented employees compared to ones in hustle and bustle cities. Fewer amenities and support services for laborers could be the factors for this demerit. As a consequence, efficient innovatives can not be frequently given from non-skilled employees, leading to the decline in the revenue stream and reputation of the businesses. Furthermore, being far from economic centers can restrict firms' access to key markets and strategic customers. They cannot always follow consumer behaviors and market demand in order to conduct prompt and suitable solutions. This results in the imbalance and deficiency when confronting against counterparts who are prioritized in populated centers. \n In conclusion, I believe that while moving to rural areas benefits organizations' development through urban pressure and lower business costs, its negative impacts concerned with employment and exposure to the market should not be disregarded.","You over discussed the essay without actually addressing the discussion topic properly. Therefore, regardless of the content of your essay, you will receive a failing score due to not meeting the discussion requirements, not achieving the task goals in terms of using the correct format for the discussion presentation. You were asked to discuss if the advantages outweighed the disadvantages or vice versa. Instead, you do discussed both opinions in the presentation That is a task inaccuracy. You created a prompt deviation and altered the overall discussion presentation from the original expectations. Therefore, you did not provide the correct writer's opinion, incorrect discussion paragraph focus, and an irrelevant discussion in the process. This is a failing essay.","Your essay provides a thoughtful examination of the advantages and disadvantages of relocating businesses from urban to rural areas. It is clear you have put effort into developing arguments to support both sides of the discussion. However, to further improve your essay and ensure it fully meets the requirements of the task, consider the following points:

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears the specific requirement to discuss whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages (or vice versa) was not directly addressed. When the task asks for a comparison or judgment like this, it's important to clearly state your position on which side you believe is stronger and why. Consider revising your conclusion to explicitly state if you think the benefits of moving businesses to rural areas are greater than the negatives, or the other way around.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** While your essay demonstrates good use of language, there are minor issues to be aware of. For example, ""stumblocks"" should be corrected to ""stumbling blocks"". Keep an eye on spell-checking and consider simplifying complex sentences for clarity and impact. Additionally, phrases such as ""hustle and bustle cities"" can be plainly stated as ""busy cities"" for easier understanding.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view comes across in the essay; however, it is somewhat diluted by not conclusively stating which aspect outweighs the other. To make your standpoint clearer, summarize your judgment in both the introduction and the conclusion, guiding the reader to understand your perspective better.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You have done well in providing arguments for both the advantages and disadvantages of the topic. To enhance this further, consider adding more specific examples or evidence to support your points. This will strengthen your arguments and make your essay more convincing. For instance, mentioning a case study or statistical data supporting businesses' success in rural areas can validate your arguments about lowered costs and reduced urban pressure.

Remember, the goal of such essays is to demonstrate your ability to engage with a topic critically and present a well-structured argument. By focusing more precisely on the task's specifics, ensuring linguistic accuracy, and reinforcing your arguments with clear examples, you can elevate the quality of your writing significantly.

However, using a simple way of rising cost of petrol will not only have no results but also bring more drawbacks than usual, therefore, people must adopt other solutions which can address this. \n I firmly believe that rising the price of fossil fuels is not going to curtail the number of drivers using vehicles such as private cars and motorbikes; thus, it will not minimize the effects on the traffic and environment. Furthermore, that situation can lead to the fact that the cost of transportation can go up and make travellers meet more dilemmas and difficulties while they have to spend more than usual to travel every day. \n I believe without a doubt that instead of increasing the price of the resources, people have to concentrate on developing a new kind of petrol which is environmental friendlier while its cost is nearly unchanged when compared to the main sorts of petrol that we are using. Thus, this would be a more effective strategy for improving a clean atmosphere after persuading civilians to start using this alternative choice. To tackle the traffic congestion issue, the most operative action is to improve the choice of public transport so that people can have lots of available services to travel which is more affordable and convenient than using their own vehicles; therefore, traffic on the roads would be dramatically reduce. \n To conclude, i strongly disagree that rising the price of petrol can be a solution for the traffic congestion and environmental issues, instead, only by using a cleaner resources and improve public transportation services would these problems be solved.","Your prompt paraphrase inaccurate. You are also making claims that are not included in the original presentation. This indicates that you are trying to change the discussion topic and discussion format for the essay. You will lose points for that. Always be accurate. Always indicate a clear restatement, without exaggerations. Outline your response to the questions so that you will have an easy to refer to guide for your topic content when writing the essay. A better restatement would have been: \n <em>Due to the increasing traffic jams and greenhouse effects, a suggestion has been made regarding the cost of gasoline in relation to solving the previously mentioned problems. It has been implied that multiplying the cost of fuel in relation to use should produce a satisfactory solution to the problems diesel fuel causes. I strongly oppose this solution. In place of this, I suggest that using alternative energy sources for transport vehicles would be a more viable solution to the problems.</em> \n The prompt paraphrase should represent the topic statement, the response to the question, and a direct response to the additional question.

Use only 1 topic per paragraph so you can clearly develop your explanations as per scoring guidelines.","Your essay on the topic of rising petrol costs as a solution to traffic and environmental problems has some strong points, but it also has areas that need improvement to make your argument more compelling and aligned with the requirements of an English proficiency test essay. Let's address these aspects one by one.

Firstly, when paraphrasing the prompt or introducing your stance, accuracy is crucial. It appears your introduction slightly alters the original topic, potentially leading to misconceptions about your understanding of the subject. A more effective approach would be to clearly restate the topic and your position without deviating from the original meaning. Consider refining your introduction to more closely reflect the statement and suggested solutions, affirming your stance in a structured manner. This ensures that your essay directly answers the question and sets a clear direction for your arguments.

Regarding the structure of your essay, it is essential to observe conventional essay formatting norms. This includes the use of proper punctuation and adherence to paragraph guidelines. Each paragraph should consist of 3-5 well-structured sentences. To enhance readability and coherence, avoid creating overly long sentences or paragraphs that can confuse the reader. Proper use of punctuation, like semi-colons, can help connect related ideas within a sentence without leading to run-on sentences.

Your essay would benefit from a more systematic development of reasoning paragraphs. Sticking to one topic per paragraph allows for deeper exploration and clearer argumentation. Currently, your essay suggests alternative solutions to the issue but lacks concrete examples and detailed reasons to back your stances convincingly. To strengthen your argument, consider dedicating individual paragraphs to:
1. Articulating your opposition to increasing petrol prices, supported by logical reasoning.
2. Explaining your first alternative solution, providing evidence or examples for its viability.
3. Optionally, offering a second alternative measure, again with supporting details.

Incorporating these elements can enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of your essay, ensuring each argument is fully developed and supported. Remember, the goal is not only to present your viewpoint but also to substantiate it through clear, reasoned arguments that directly address the topic.

Finally, spelling, grammar, and stylistic choices play a significant role in the overall effectiveness of your essay. While your essay is mostly clear, minor errors and stylistic choices, like the informal use of 'i' instead of the proper 'I', detract from its professionalism. Paying attention to these details can significantly improve the readability and formal tone of your essay.

In conclusion, focus on accurately addressing the prompt, structuring your essay correctly, developing your arguments with clear, supported reasoning, and refining your language use.

As far as I am concerned, this should not be the scenario because only an educated people can make the society successful and prosperous. At the moment, the world is advancing at an incredible speed and to be in the race a community require experts in every field such as IT experts, scientist and doctors and to produce these people a society need a well structured and free of cost education system because mostly hardworking candidates are from poor background but they have courage to do something for themselves and the society and that courage make them to breakthrough in their field. Therefore, the government should need to have some sort of scholarships to support the students to get higher education which can be the main reason of a society to become successful. Moreover, in my opinion there should be some pocket money given to bright students to encourage them more to work hard because they are the future of the society and these are the ones who going to serve for their community. For example if a government support the candidates of a rural areas to get higher education of medical and become doctor then after completing their education it is obvious that they will go back to their villages and open an hospital to serve the people of that area and then the patient will not be require to commute to the city to get basic medical facility. To conclude, it can be reiterated that government should support the candidates while getting higher education because it is only education which can bring the change to the society's future.","I have to immediately call your attention to the presentation format of this essay. I am not sure if you used a mobile phone to write this essay or you had posted it in the text box without correcting the formatting instructions but, this is a very bad essay format to use. Remember to divide the presentation into discussion paragraphs. Separate these by topic for clarity and ease of reading. You cannot use a compressed format in your presentation because the examiner will have a difficult time reading your work. It also shows that you were not properly taught how to write essays in your school, which is something that is standard in US and UK, and European education. \n The writer's opinion presents a thesis statement but not a direct response to the extent question. Both the measured response and thesis sentence are required in every prompt restatement + writer's opinion paragraph.

It is necessary to meet all of the writing requirements for full scoring consideration. The writer's opinion in response to the question needs to be mentioned twice. Once in the restatement and the second, within the summary conclusion. \n Discussion paragraphs for the essay are difficult to understand due to the writer's lack of control over word usage and sentence structuring. The GRA score for this essay will be within the failing range due to the confusion that the statements makes. Readers will find it difficult to follow the stream of thought in the presentation. \n The second reasoning paragraph is a total prompt deviation that is unrelated to the given discussion points. Therefore, that paragraph will not be awarded any points and the essay will receive a final score based on a under developed discussion presentation. \n Make more of an effort to write clearly.

This is a strong stance, and your commitment to this viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. However, there are several areas where this essay could be significantly improved to better convey your arguments and meet the expectations of an English proficiency test essay format.

First, the presentation of your essay needs careful attention. It's crucial to organize your essay into separate paragraphs, each discussing a specific aspect of your argument. This not only makes your essay easier to read and follow but also demonstrates your ability to organize thoughts coherently—a skill highly valued in academic writing. Your essay should include an introduction, several body paragraphs discussing your arguments, followed by a conclusion. This structure is not just a preference but a standard in educational systems in many countries, including the US, UK, and Europe.

Regarding your thesis statement and response to the essay question, while your position is stated, it falls short of directly addressing the full scope of the prompt. A strong essay explicitly states the writer's opinion in response to the question at both the beginning and end of the essay. Make sure to clearly restate the question in your own words, present your thesis, and then summarize your stance in the conclusion for clarity and effectiveness.

Your essay suffers from issues related to sentence structure and word usage, making some sections difficult to understand. This lack of clarity disrupts the flow of your argument, making it hard for readers to follow your line of thought. To improve, consider simplifying your language and focusing on building clear, straightforward sentences. This will help in presenting your ideas more effectively and make your writing more accessible to your audience.

Specifically, your essay deviates from the prompt in some paragraphs, presenting ideas that don't directly support your main argument. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea that supports your thesis, ensuring all parts of your essay work together to make a cohesive argument. Straying from the topic not only confuses readers but can also impact the overall score of your essay.

In addition to these structural and organizational improvements, consider focusing on more precise language and providing concrete examples to support your claims. For instance, when discussing the benefit of government-funded education, offering specific scenarios or statistics can make your argument more compelling.

To conclude, while your essay presents a valuable perspective on the importance of government-supported education, paying attention to structure, clarity, organization, and directly addressing the essay prompt will significantly enhance the quality of your writing. Practice organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs, simplifying your language for clarity, and ensuring each part of your essay supports your main thesis.

4324,https://essayforum.com/writing/employment-pressure-graduate-students-76076/,test,The employment pressure of graduate students,"With the rapid development of society, recent years have witnessed an increasing number of graduate students facing with too heavy pressures, such as academic stress, economic pressure, emotional stress, but the most serious one may be the stress of job hunting. About a decade ago, graduate students could find suitable and enviable jobs easily after their graduation. But now, things are different. More and more graduate students grumble that it is difficult to find a satisfactory job. From my own perspective, both society and individuals should be responsible for this matter. \n First of all, it is the contradiction between the ever-expanding number of graduate students and the comparatively less demand from the society that brings about a fiercer competition of the job market. For example, Amy, a graduate student, who is busy submitting her resume through the internet and job fairs, says that since a large number of job positions for her specialty are lost, she has not found a suitable job until now. According to the statistics, there were just 74% of graduate students who had found their jobs last year, and this year the number of graduate students will reach a new high, leading to a decreased chance for students to find jobs. \n At the same time, many companies are gradually improving their requirements for candidates, making the situation much worse. Through the results of a survey, many recruitment companies have made severe qualifications for graduate students, such as graduating from prestigious universities, getting certain certificates, having practical experience, having a certain height, just male or female and so on. If applicants do not meet the requirements, companies will refuse them immediately. \n Nevertheless, there are also students who have successfully found their jobs. It is found that many other graduate students who can not find work are in common because of lack of adequate social experience or knowledge to apply for positions they want. For instance, some of them spend most time at school studying academic subjects while lacking relevant job training. On the contrary, some are not interested in their subjects, therefore they are reluctant to do their experiments and even apply to postpone their graduation date. It is not surprising that when they are leaving the university campus to society, both of them feel extremely lost and frustrated in job application. \n In conclusion, not only the social environment aggravates the pressure of employment for graduate students, but also the students themselves limit them to get a better paid job. All in all, it is necessary for government, society and students to work together to solve this problem urgently.","I wish that you had given me an inclination as to what the actual prompt for this essay is. That instruction is very important in my analysis of your work and eventual scoring. I could've given you a more specific review instead. As of now, what I can tell you is that your use of the term ""graduate student"" is quite possibly wrong. A ""graduate student"" is someone who has already completed a college level education and is selling to find employment in his field of academic training. That is not the kind of person you describe in your essay. You are describing a college student, who, although a graduate is never referred to as a graduate student but rather, is simply called a ""college graduate "" or ""graduate"". Your use of the word ""but"" at the start of a sentence is academically unacceptable. You can only use but to join two related ideas in one sentence. Since a sentence does not start out presenting an idea, you cannot use the term to compose a stand alone sentence. As for the correctness of your discussion, that is a gray area because you failed to provide the prompt requirement and since I can only advice you once, you just water the opportunity to recurve a comprehensive analysis of your work from me.","Your essay makes a valuable effort to explore the multifaceted pressure faced by students transitioning from education to the job market. Your discussion effectively highlights the challenges, including academic stress, economic pressure, emotional strain, and the stress of job hunting, painting a comprehensive picture of the situation as it stands. However, to enhance your essay further and align it more closely with English academic standards, some areas need attention.

1. **Response to the Topic**:
   It appears that your essay aims to discuss the pressures facing college graduates as they enter the job market. While you've provided a thorough analysis, ensuring that your essay strictly addresses the prompt would strengthen your argument. Making the prompt clear at the beginning of your essay could help in keeping your discussion focused.

2. **Terminology**:
   The term ""graduate student"" seems to be used incorrectly throughout your essay. ""Graduate students"" are those pursuing further education after completing their undergraduate degrees, such as Master's or Ph.D. programs. The challenges you describe relate more accurately to ""college graduates"" or ""recent graduates"". Precision in terminology is crucial for clarity and accuracy in academic writing.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**:
   - The misuse of ""but"" at the beginning of sentences should be addressed. ""But"" is a conjunction meant to connect two related ideas within a sentence; starting a sentence with ""but"" is generally considered inappropriate in formal academic writing. Try employing alternatives such as ""However,"" or restructuring the sentence to maintain the flow of your argument without beginning with ""but"".
   - Some sentences could benefit from minor grammatical adjustments for smoother readability and professional presentation. For example, ""facing with too heavy pressures"" could be rephrased to ""facing significant pressures"".

4. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**:
   Your point of view comes across clearly: you propose that both societal factors and individual preparedness contribute to the difficulties faced by recent graduates. This balanced perspective is an asset to your essay. Ensuring each paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence summarizing its main idea would further enhance clarity.

5. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**:
   Your essay does well to incorporate examples and statistics, like the case of Amy and job market data, which support your arguments effectively. Expanding on these with more detail or additional examples could strengthen your position further. Moreover, drawing on a wider range of sources or evidence could add depth to your discussion.

Finally, while your essay aptly covers the challenges recent graduates face, incorporating a brief discussion on potential solutions or strategies students could employ to overcome these pressures would provide a more rounded conclusion. This addition could inspire readers and give your essay a more proactive and hopeful tone.

I will elaborate with reasons below. \n The popularity enriches with valuable life experiences to those famous young people. Usually, similar schedules are fixed in most of the teens, such as completing assignments or preparing exams. So they cannot experience a life other than studying in their youth. Being popular as teenagers allow them to live a different lifestyle, with loyal fans and wealth. These changes will soon become an important part of the life lesson to them. \n Moreover, the young generations' voices are powerful.

Her speeches on the stage influence many people point of views towards women and the LGBT community. It is because of her young age with such knowledgeable thinkings that impresses the audience. \n Last but not least, the fame provokes the famous youth to ruminate their past so they will show more gratitude to one another. Whenever they start reflecting on their lives, they are likely to compare the present and the past. Presumably, they will understand being famous is challenging. As a result, they will appreciate what they have and be good to others. \n To recapitulate, people who are famous at their young age gain extraordinary experiences in their lives. Their words are also influential to the people. And the popularity renders them to be more thankful. \n -------","there is a problem in your representation of the prompt statement. ""Younger than others"" implies that you are discussing about an age difference in the essay. That is not the case. You are merely referring to young people in general. Then, you did not really offer a clear idea of what your reason for your opinion is, which left the direct question essay, that should have a direct response, pointless. Here's a sample thesis statement for this essay with a more appropriate response: \n <em>There are some celebrities who become popular during their adolescence. I believe that this is something that can be viewed in a positive manner. Popularity at an early age can result in a more enlightened adult. The reasons behind this are lessons learned from mistakes in life and a growing voice of influence as they experience a different life from other people of a similar age.<br/><br/>The life experiences...<br/><br/>These experiences help the youth to develop a more influential and powerful voice...</em> \n Emma Watson is a good example however, you failed to illustrate how her voice helps her cause in the industry or helps to influence other youth. \n Your concluding summary is not complete. You forgot to restate your response to the direct question as the closing sentence of this paragraph. Mistakes aside, you have shown a tremendous improvement in your work with this essay.","The essay provided makes an interesting argument about the positive aspects of celebrities becoming famous at a young age. However, there are several areas where it could be improved for clarity, coherence, and relevance to the topic.

Firstly, it's important to directly address the topic given. The initial statement about celebrities being ""younger than others"" isn't fully explored in terms of age differences among celebrities. Instead, the focus shifts to the general idea of young people becoming famous. A clearer thesis statement at the beginning could better guide readers. For instance, stating something like, ""Becoming famous during adolescence can have positive outcomes, such as unique life lessons and a significant influence on society.""

Regarding content and organization, the points made do enrich the argument but need further development. While mentioning the benefits of youthful fame, such as a different lifestyle and influential voice, providing more detailed examples or evidence would strengthen these claims. For example, when discussing Emma Watson, elaborating on how her advocacy work specifically impacts her audience could make the argument more compelling.

From a grammatical perspective, there are a few areas that require attention. Being mindful of sentence structure and verb tense consistency can enhance the readability of the essay. Also, using more varied vocabulary and avoiding repetition would improve the stylistic quality of the writing.

The point of view is somewhat clear but could be made more explicit with a stronger thesis and more defined personal insights. Connecting your arguments back to the thesis throughout the essay will help maintain a clear point of view.

Finally, the conclusion needs to reinforce the essay's main points and thesis statement. Rather than simply summarizing, it should tie back to why these points support your viewpoint on the positive aspects of young celebrities. Mentioning how early fame can lead to a more enlightened adulthood, as suggested in the human feedback, could provide a more rounded conclusion.

Overall, the essay does cover some valid points regarding the positives of becoming famous at a young age. With adjustments for clearer thesis formulation, detailed examples, grammatical accuracy, and a more impactful conclusion, it could more effectively convey the intended message.

While the essay addresses a relevant and significant topic, there are several areas that could be improved to strengthen the argumentation, clarity, and overall effectiveness of the writing. Here are some specific points of feedback focusing on the initial request for ensuring the essay fully responds to the topic, addresses spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, clarifies the author's point of view, and provides clear, descriptive arguments to support the author's position.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay begins by stating an opinion but doesn't fully lay out both perspectives before diving into the argument. It's crucial to introduce both viewpoints clearly to the reader before presenting personal opinions. For example, a more effective introduction might give a brief overview of why some people believe maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a personal responsibility, while others see it as a governmental duty. This approach ensures that all parts of the topic are addressed and sets the stage for a balanced discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While the essay is generally well-written, attention to detail in grammar and style would enhance readability and professionalism. For instance, look out for run-on sentences, proper use of commas (e.g., before ""however""), and ensure consistency in tense and voice throughout the essay. Additionally, reviewing the essay for varied sentence structures could make the writing more engaging.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The author's point of view is expressed; however, it tends to merge with the general discussion, making it somewhat difficult to distinguish personal stance from the objective analysis of both sides. It is beneficial to distinctly state personal opinions towards the end of the essay after a fair discussion of both perspectives. This structure guides the reader through the debate before arriving at the writer’s conclusions, making the argument stronger and more persuasive.

4. **Descriptive Arguments Supporting the Position**: The essay mentions important concepts, such as the role of self-conviction and government initiatives in promoting a healthy lifestyle, yet these arguments could be developed further. Providing specific examples or statistics, describing potential government policies in more detail, or illustrating personal convictions with real-world outcomes could all lend more weight to the arguments. Moreover, exploring counterarguments and then refuting them can deepen the essay's analytical aspect.

In summary, focusing on a balanced exposition of the topic, refining language and style, clearly stating and supporting personal viewpoints, and enriching the discussion with detailed arguments and examples would significantly enhance the essay. These improvements aim not only to boost the writing score but also to engage and inform the reader effectively.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative
4327,https://essayforum.com/writing/work-study-home-95798/,test,IELTS WRITING TASK 2 - WORK AND STUDY FROM HOME,"WWorking from home has become a trend for both workers and students thanks to the accessibility of technology. Although there are inherent problems with this, I reckon this is a fundamentally positive development by its flexibility and controllability. \n Proponents of distant working may cite controllability as their primary argument. Executives may find struggle in checking whether their employees have been engrossed in their tasks or not, ensuring the possible outcome of the task. Moreover, students can be easily distracted with their surrounding environment, lessening the concentrating ability, which leads to lower amount of knowledge absorbed. This eventually reduces their cognitive ability, degrading the quality of the future workforce. \n However, I challenge this notion by the flexibility of online working and studying. In major enterprises, outcome, calculated by how a worker contributes to them, is of more importance; hence, workplace is not their priority anymore, but the productivity. This can be exemplified by the fact that an increasing number of the young generation have been visiting coffee shops to work and study because these places serve romantic scenes, relaxing music and beverage, contrasting with noisy offices and classes, where colleagues often have conversation in groups. At the same time, with the advent of technology, teachers can manage their pupils by online exams, testing how much of the lesson they have acquired. Another justification is that students who have financial difficulties may find it easier to be admitted to major universities around the world. Thanks to online classes, they do not necessasrily have to travel overseas to attend lectures from eminent professionals anymore, which is more secured when saving a sum of money for accommodation, flight fees and the chance of getting culture shock. \n In conclusion, it is my conviction that the tendency towards online learning is largely positive in light of the flexibility of work and the access to higher learning materials. \n _______","The paraphrasing for the original topic is acceptable. The writer understood the writing task as can be seen from his properly developed opinion and thesis statement. However, that is not to say that the discussion followed the correct development format. It focused on only one of the 2 given discussion considerations when both were expected to be defended, in terms of his previously stated opinion. He must not veer away from his opinion statement, even if he references a discussion by other people since this is a single opinion essay. Both opinions, covering one paragraph for students, one for workers, must be seen as only supporting the writer's given opinion. Any paragraphs that do not provide a supporting stance will not be considered for scoring and will be deducted from the word count. The essay will not receive a passing score, regardless of the overwritten word count in the presentation.","The essay successfully addresses the topic by presenting a clear stance on the advantages of working and studying from home, demonstrating an understanding of the assignment. The introduction effectively rephrases the prompt and sets up the thesis statement, which is a critical strength. However, the development of the argument could be improved to align more closely with the essay's initial stance.

A significant concern is that the essay tends to focus predominantly on one aspect of the discussion, without equally defending both perspectives as suggested by the thesis statement. It's vital that both sides of the argument—pertaining to students and workers—are integrated to support the author's view comprehensively. Any section that doesn't actively contribute to reinforcing the original opinion may detract from the overall effectiveness and impact of the essay, and could result in a lower score.

Additionally, there are a few areas where the essay can be improved for clarity and coherence:

1. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are minor spelling errors (""WWorking"" should be ""Working"", ""necessasrily"" should be ""necessarily"") that can easily be corrected with a thorough proofreading. Paying attention to these details will enhance the professionalism and readability of the essay.

2. **Stylistic Issues**: At times, the sentence structure is a bit complex and could benefit from simplification. Simplifying the language will not only make the essay more accessible to a wider audience but will also avoid potential clarity issues.

3. **Clear Point of View**: The point of view is mostly clear, but maintaining a consistent stance throughout the essay will strengthen the argument. Avoid shifting away from your opinion, even when discussing contrary viewpoints. Every part of the essay should work to support your initial thesis.

4. **Support for Arguments**: The arguments presented are valid but require more detailed examples and explanations to be fully compelling. Specifically, illustrating how both students and workers benefit from online environments will provide a stronger foundation for your claims. Additionally, ensure that your examples directly relate to and support your thesis to maintain a focused and cohesive argument.

In conclusion, this essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and presents valuable insights. With more balanced argumentation, a focus on supporting the thesis throughout, addressing minor spelling and grammatical issues, and simplification of complex sentences, the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the essay will significantly improve. Focusing on these areas will not only align the essay more closely with the requirements but also enhance its overall impact and coherence.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

The major merits of working in large businesses may be related to more opportunities while its drawbacks concern the issue of instrumentalization of employees. \n There are several benefits to working in large businesses. First of all, well-established management methods could ensure that all employees with the same conditions have equal treatment to a large extent. For example, in terms of personnel adjustment employees who have similar work performance will be considered a promotion equally regardless of race or gender. Moreover, large companies probably provide more opportunities and better platforms for employees' self-development and growth. In other words, people working in large companies may frequently face new and tricky challenges that would give them precious experiences in their career development. Furthermore, large companies are more likely to be well-functioned and have a long history. Thus, they are more robust in facing crises compared to small businesses. For employees, a stable job is a major attraction. \n While there are several advantages to working in large businesses, it is important to consider the disadvantages. The production routines and business categories in a large company are normally settled. Most of the work employees do every day may be repetitive and focused on enhancement rather than invention. Thus, working in a non-creative department in a large company may be dull. In addition, the labour division in a relatively large business tends to be well-fixed and the mobility level is relatively low. People working in a large company may be assigned to very specific and trivial tasks. As a result, they may not be fully developed in terms of working abilities, which may be adverse if they want to change career paths or just find another job. \n To conclude, large companies could provide employees with better opportunities and larger platforms, while they may show the inclination to instrumentalize employees.""","Why did you write the response in quotation marks from beginning to end? That is unnecessary in a task 2 essay. You just need to write the essay in block format, nothing more, nothing less. You may also want to consider writing 300 words to help you stay within the 40 minute writing allotment so that you can have a few minutes to review your work before submission. You missed some mistakes in your writing because you did not proofread the paper prior to submission. Those small errors can add up and cause you to fail the test you know. Always leave at least 10 minutes to review your work in case changes and improvements need to be applied.","Your essay successfully addresses the topic, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of working in large businesses. This comparison provides a well-rounded view of the subject, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where you could improve your essay to elevate its quality and effectiveness.

Firstly, it's important to ensure your essay follows the appropriate format. You've enclosed the entire essay in quotation marks, which is unnecessary. For Task 2 essays, a simple block format without any quotation marks is preferred. This helps in maintaining clarity and adheres to standard essay-writing conventions.

Regarding the essay's length, aim for around 300 words. This word count is optimal for staying within the 40-minute writing allotment while leaving a few minutes to review and revise your work. Speaking of reviewing, always allocate at least 10 minutes at the end to proofread your essay. This practice is crucial as small errors can accumulate and negatively impact your score. By revising, you can catch and correct these mistakes, thereby enhancing the overall quality of your submission.

In terms of content, your essay does a good job of presenting both sides of the argument. Yet, there are a few areas where clarity and effectiveness could be improved:

1. Spelling and grammatical errors are present, which can detract from the reader's understanding. Such mistakes can be minimized with careful proofreading.
2. The essay's point of view is generally clear, but making a more compelling argument for each side would strengthen your position. Providing more specific examples and elaborating on the points mentioned would make your arguments more persuasive.
3. While you've identified the advantages and disadvantages of working in large companies, diving deeper into the implications of these points would add depth to your analysis. Discussing how these factors affect employees on a personal level could provide a more nuanced perspective.

All I could think was: ""Why I'm I crying"", as I could not understand why. \n The next time it happened was when I was reading a story in which a character was staying close to a little girl in a hospital bed while recalling the little things they did together and the promise he made to her: ""I will also get better, so that we can go and ride bicycles together"". Feeling relieved that she was still alive. \n This and a few similar instances made me realize that it was because I cherished the unconditional love that they had for each. That it didn't have anything to do with what that person had or would have, but because he accepted that person with all the flaws she had and cared so much for her that he was willing to put her before himself. \n But what followed was a realization that while this is something that I'm feeling from the depths of my heart, it is in a lot of ways coming from trauma and parts of my childhood. The feelings that I didn't get then that I so much cherish now. It was also because I deep down know that it will take a lot from me to achieve that. While I may be a very curious person, I am also very selfish and self absorbed. Not caring about other people nearly as much as I should. \n And I think that that is okay. It is a part of mine and while I don't necessarily love it, I have learned to cherish it. It is after all proof that I am a living person with trauma, feelings and emotions.

I understand you are new to English writing so you should be careful. Make sure that you double check the grammar after writing, before you submit your paper. That way you can lessen the obvious mistakes you make in the essay. \n The presentation is not very smooth. You will do well to learn to use better transition methods so that there will be a proper connection between the previous paragraph and the next one. It will help make the presentation more understandable to the reader. The fact that you are trying to connect this to your own life and traumas means that you should be using a more personal transition approach to the writing.","The essay presents a deeply personal reflection on the experience of feeling and understanding unconditional love, connecting it with personal trauma and self-awareness. While the core message is powerful, there are several areas where improvement could make the essay more effective and engaging for the reader. Here’s a detailed feedback focusing on content relevance, language, structure, and clarity of argument.

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The essay successfully addresses an implied topic of personal growth and realization through experiences of unconditional love and introspection. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state the essay's main idea early on to guide the reader through your reflections.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some grammatical errors that need attention. For example, ""Why I'm I crying"" should be corrected to ""Why am I crying?"" Paying attention to grammar will help clarify your intended meaning and make your writing more professional. Consider using grammar checking tools or revising your essay after a short break to catch such errors.

3. **Clarity of Author’s Viewpoint**: Your perspective is clear—you've had profound personal realizations about love, self, and trauma. However, to strengthen your viewpoint, avoid broad statements and focus on specific, personal examples that illustrate your journey. This specificity will make your arguments more persuasive and relatable.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Viewpoint**: While you share meaningful anecdotes, the essay could benefit from clearer connections between these stories and your overarching thesis. Consider using transition sentences that bridge your personal experiences with your reflections on love and self-awareness. This will not only improve the flow of your essay but also reinforce your arguments.

5. **Transitions and Flow**: The essay has a tendency to jump from one idea to another without smooth transitions, making it challenging for the reader to follow your thought process. Using transitional phrases can help create a more cohesive narrative. Phrases like ""This realization led me to understand,"" or ""Reflecting on this, I recognized,"" could serve as bridges between your ideas, enhancing the overall flow of the essay.

6. **Personal Tone and Engagement**: Your use of a personal tone is effective in engaging the reader, making your reflections on love, trauma, and self-realization relatable. Continuing to write from a personal perspective will strengthen your connection with the audience. Sharing more about how these realizations have impacted your actions or perception would add depth to your essay.

It’s commendable that you've chosen to explore such profound topics. Focusing on clear expression, cohesive structure, and grammatical accuracy will significantly enhance the impact of your writing. Keep reflecting and writing about your experiences and lessons, as this practice will continue to refine your skills and deepen your insights.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Narrative

Although this practice might facilitate a better user experience, I believe the trend is negative as people will likely be vulnerable to cyber-crimes. \n To begin with, posting personal information online brings lots of benfits. The key factor is that by providing the Internet with personal data, users are effortlessly able to log into some social networks or other platforms and this leads to the convenience in many aspects. For example, when consumers want to purchase any products on e-commercial websites such as Amazon or Alibaba, they can immediately order as all the necessary information for delivery had been saved since the log-in step. Furthermore, it is uncomplicated for people to broaden their social relationship and also a convenient way to get in contact with their relatives and friends. \n On the other hand, I wholehearted believe that putting private details on social media open a way to execute criminal activities. The first reason is the address, telephone number and any personal data can be stolen by sophisticated cyber-crimes and used for negative purposes such as scam, blackmails and so on. As a result, people whose information are leaked might have to face up with numerous consequences. To be more specific, almost victims of cyber- crimes have gone through lots of difficulties in not only finance but also health. Their entire money in banking account is took away, which means they do not have any savings to make ends meet. Morever, the victims might contract to some diseases such as autism or axiety disorders due to the financial pressure. \n In conclusion, despite the advantages of sharing personal information online, I hold a belief that users should be aware of the serious risks of publicising private details to protect themselves from cyber-attack.","<quotation>user experience</quotation> \n Good restatement but it should have had a direct reference to the indicated channels where the use of personal data is required. Excellent work on the personal opinion. The thesis statement really helped support the clarity of your opinion. Expect to get a very impressive score in this section. \n <quotation>posting personal information online brings lots of benfits.</quotation> \n There is no need to explain the benefits. The examiner already knows what there are. Your focus, should solely be on presenting 2 reasons that support your opinion. This discussion deviation will not help increase your cohesive discussion scoll as the paragraphs are now unrelated in terms off discussion focus. \n So what happened to your presentation? It appears that you have provided only 1 discussion related paragraph. This reduces the development of your discussion potential as further supporting evidence is required in a 2nd paragraph. You might get a low passing score because of this. Do not waste your scoring potential. You clearly understood the topic but got waylaid, and in the process, a lower score because of the discussion deviation in the first reasoning paragraph.","The essay addresses the topic well by discussing the issue of providing personal details online, weighing the convenience against the risk of cyber-crimes. The clear stance against the trend due to the vulnerability it creates is a strong point. This clarity, especially with the inclusion of a thesis statement, effectively communicates the author's viewpoint and supports the essay's argumentative structure. 

However, while exploring the benefits of posting personal information online for user convenience, it's essential to remember that the primary focus should be on supporting the essay's main argument. The discussion on benefits, though important for a balanced view, diverts attention away from directly supporting the negative stance on the issue. Instead, the essay would benefit from presenting two distinct reasons that align directly with the opinion to strengthen the argument and maintain coherence throughout the essay.

There are a few spelling and grammatical issues, such as ""benfits"" which should be corrected to ""benefits"", and ""Morever"" to ""Moreover"". Consistency in spelling and grammar is crucial for clarity and professionalism. Additionally, some stylistic refinements could enhance the essay's readability and impact, such as varying sentence structures and ensuring a logical flow of ideas.

In terms of arguments, the essay attempts to describe the potential dangers of cyber-crimes stemming from sharing personal information online. However, the arguments would benefit from being more developed and specific. Including concrete examples, statistics, or studies could strengthen the point about cyber-crimes and their impact on victims.

The mention of serious consequences, like financial loss and health issues, is an excellent start but could be elaborated on. For example, explaining how cyber-crimes lead to these specific outcomes and providing more detailed scenarios could make the argument more persuasive and engaging.

In conclusion, focusing on directly relevant arguments to support the stance, improving spelling and grammatical accuracy, and adding depth to the analysis of the negative impacts of sharing personal information online will significantly enhance the essay. Remember, specificity and coherency in presenting and supporting your viewpoint are crucial for a compelling argumentative essay.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

The author has recommended that in order to become well-rounded individuals, all college students should be required to take courses in which they read various types of literature like poetry, novels, mythology. This recommendation does seem believable at first, but having thought through is not convincing enough. \n The author recommends that all college students should be required to take courses that will help them to become well-rounded individuals. The best time to indulge such moral thoughts into the minds of children is at the tender age of 8 to 12 years, as it is easy for the teachers to mold the students at this age. For instance, in many countries, personality development courses are compulsory for students at the mid-level of their schooling. This is mainly because the personality of any grown-up college student is almost in developed-form and forcing to take these courses will not help him to become a well-rounded individual at the college level. \n Secondly, students already have a penchant for certain courses and want to explore more in them. Many students prefer courses in fields of management, engineering, business, finance, etc. These students will be more curious about those fields which they find interesting and hence would like to know about them in-depth. Thus, they wouldn't prefer to spend their time in studying literature. Therefore, making compulsion for taking these courses may even lose the interest of these students in studying. Thus, rather than becoming a well-rounded individual, they might end up being antipode of it. \n In addition to that, a well-rounded individual has an experience or a knowledge of different fields, and thus studying courses in which they have to read poetry, novels, mythology, and other types of imaginative literature will not be enough to become one. For instance, in a cricket team if there is a player who is a specialist in only batting then it will be incorrect to entitle him as an all-rounder player, instead, it is essential for a player to have expertise in other fields as well. Similarly, focusing only on literature will not make a person well-rounded, but also other skills like sports, communication, are important. Thus, taking courses that only include reading poetry, novels, mythology, and other types of imaginative literature is not sufficient to become well-rounded. \n To sum up, the author's recommendation is not agreeable as taking such courses by college students does not give surety of becoming a well-rounded individual.","Did you write this for a CBEST essay?

Your paragraphs fail to properly utilize a topic sentence at the start and a transition sentence at the end to introduce the next topic. Overall, the essay suffers when comparing the facts of the article with the reasoning of the writer. Again, this is just an assumption on my part since you failed to include the original article for comparison purposes.","Your essay aims to critique the recommendation that college students should take literature courses to become well-rounded individuals. 

1. **Relevance to Topic**: Your essay directly addresses the proposed recommendation, maintaining focus on whether literature courses should be a mandatory part of college education to foster well-rounded individuals. This shows a good understanding of the topic and a clear attempt to engage with it critically.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, Stylistic Issues**: Generally, your essay is well-written with minimal spelling errors. However, attention to grammar and style could enhance clarity and readability. For example, more varied sentence structures and careful attention to punctuation (especially comma usage) would make your arguments more compelling and easier to follow. Be cautious of using overly complex sentences, as they can sometimes obscure the point you're aiming to make.

3. **Author's Point of View**: Your stance against the recommendation is evident throughout the essay. You've clearly articulated your viewpoint that imposing literature courses on college students might not be the best approach to creating well-rounded individuals. This clear stance is a strength of your essay.

4. **Arguments and Support**: You provide several arguments to support your position, including the timing of personality development and students' pre-existing interests. However, these arguments would benefit from more specific examples and evidence. Furthermore, integrating a topic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph and a transition sentence at the end could greatly improve the flow and coherence of your essay. This structure helps the reader to follow your logic and understand how each paragraph contributes to your overall argument.

While your critique of focusing solely on literature courses is valid, consider exploring how these courses could complement other forms of learning rather than dismissing them outright. Acknowledging potential benefits while still arguing your position could strengthen your analysis.

Regarding your point about the preferable age for moral and personality education, it's essential to substantiate such claims with credible sources or logical reasoning. Without reference to specific studies or theories, this argument remains unsubstantiated and weakens your overall position.

Lastly, although comparing well-rounded individuals to all-rounders in cricket is creative, ensure your analogies are directly relevant and contribute to the clarity of your argument. Sometimes simpler explanations are more effective.

In summary, your essay commendably addresses the topic at hand and presents a clear viewpoint. Improving the structure of your paragraphs, enhancing the support for your arguments, and refining your grammar and style will significantly increase the effectiveness of your critique.

Although experts in the healthcare domain advise that the elders should take part in physical activities on a regular basis, a great number of them ignore it. In this essay, I will argue why health and safety problems are the main factors which affect the way older people get exercise. Besides, I will provide several solutions to solve these problems. \n When it comes to the elderly, there are health issues to be considered as older people are more likely to get diseases. Indeed, ailments such as diabetes or high blood pressure affect their motor abilities. Therefore, seniors are unable to do physical activities according to weak physical conditions. An obvious example is my friend's grandmother, who is at the age of 69, is suffering from arteriosclerosis. Her grandmother is unable to walk or do basic hygiene without supporters. Furthermore, safety problems are factors which should be noticed. In recent years, sports centres have grown excessively. However, these fitness centres only provide facilities which are also known as gym equipment for young people. Accordingly, weak eye sights and joints can lead to severe injuries in older citizens if they approach inappropriate fitness facilities. \n In order to tackle these problems, developing a positive attitude to exercise at an early age would be a necessary solution. In short, by providing basic healthcare education for younger generations, they can build up an exercise routine which can stick to them from an early age. As a result, young people will be able to prevent the ageing process and chronic diseases. Moreover, the government should give the elders opportunities to enhance their strength by creating more walking pathways in safe areas. Even more, encouraging older citizens to do internal nourishing exercise is a great method since it can facilitate a healthy development both mentally and physically for the elderly. \n To sum up, even though it is recommended to work out regularly, many older people remaining lack exercise. I argued why some issues like health and safety play an important role in the way the elders exercise. For the aforementioned causes, education, publicity campaigns and government policies are the core solutions to encourage the elderly to do more physical activities.","A properly written 40 minute essay should contain no more than 300 words.

1. **Adherence to the Topic**: The essay addresses the assigned topic by discussing the reasons why older people might not exercise and proposing solutions. However, the response could be more focused. The essay somewhat lacks a direct answer to the second part of the question about proposing solutions. Consider revising to ensure both parts of the question are equally and directly addressed.

2. **Length and Content**: The essay exceeds the recommended word count for a 40-minute test writing task, which is around 300 words.

Aim for a more concise presentation of your ideas to stay within the word limit, ensuring you can finish your discussion within the expected time frame.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The introduction successfully sets up the topic, but the thesis statement could be strengthened by clearly responding to the entire prompt. Remember, a strong thesis statement guides the reader through your argument and sets the stage for your discussion. Ensure your thesis statement fully reflects your position and covers all aspects of the prompt.

4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Overall, the essay is well-written, but there are occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that could be refined. Pay special attention to verb tense consistency and the correct use of articles. Improving these aspects can significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.

5. **Arguments and Support**: Your arguments are generally clear and supported with relevant examples. However, these could be made more persuasive by deepening the analysis and connecting the examples more directly to your main argument. It's also beneficial to explore a wider variety of evidence and examples to support your points.

6. **Solutions and Conclusion**: The solutions provided are a good start, but they could be expanded upon with more specific examples and a clearer explanation of how they address the problems mentioned. The conclusion effectively summarizes the essay but could more forcefully reiterate your stance and the importance of the solutions proposed.

By focusing on these areas, the essay could be significantly improved, making it more concise, coherent, and compelling.

Some difficulties in life such as being broke or unhappy jobs are sometimes accepted by people; nonetheless, there are also people always seeking for solutions and improvements. For me, I side with the latter idea. \n There are some justifications explaining for reasons why people opt to do nothing with their bad situations. One of them is due to their pessimism. Those who always think of the possibilities of failures and barriers would never make a move forwards. In this case, they find no reasons to make efforts to improve their circumstances and forfeit their benefits. Besides that, there are also people have a desire for a change but do not have a problem-solving skills. Consequently, having no clues to do people feel less encouraged or feasible to strive for an improvement. As a result, this type of people choose for doing nothing for their bad events. \n On contrast, the reverse way of coping with the situations mentioned above is to strive for an improvement, With a different perspective about life, people take distinctive responses to what they encounter during their life.

For instance, sentences like ""Besides that, there are also people have a desire for a change but do not have a problem-solving skills"" could be corrected to ""Besides, there are also people who desire change but do not have problem-solving skills."" Paying attention to verb agreement and the use of articles would improve the readability of your essay. It's also suggested to break down complex sentences into simpler ones for clarity.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: While you mention your stance clearly towards the end of the introduction, embedding your point of view more explicitly in each paragraph would strengthen the essay. A topic sentence at the start of each paragraph illustrating your viewpoint could guide the reader more effectively through your arguments.

4. **Argument Structure and Development**: Your arguments would benefit from more detailed development and concrete examples. The essay currently lists reasons why people might not seek to improve their situations but lacks depth in examining why striving for improvement is beneficial. Expanding your points with examples or more detailed reasoning would make your argument more persuasive. Also, incorporating a distinct third paragraph to fully elaborate on your personal viewpoint, as opposed to briefly mentioning it in the conclusion, would adhere to a more structured and effective essay format.

Remember, practice with sentence development and structuring your essay to include clear topic sentences for each paragraph will not only improve readability but also significantly enhance the persuasive power of your writing. Keep these points in mind for your revisions, and your essay will undoubtedly show marked improvement.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4334,https://essayforum.com/writing/government-payment-nursery-homes-79401/,test,"IELTS, task2, Government payment for nursery homes.","In the UK, elderly usually go to nursery houses in order to take care of them, and it is sometimes the responsibility of the government to provide such care. This essay agrees that government should pay for this service when people get old not their families. This essay will give the reasons that justify such opinion as people spend most of their lives pay taxes when they have the ability to work so it is time to be paid off. Also, elderly need special care that sometimes family cannot provide. \n Young people have to give sometimes half of their salaries to the authorities under the title of ""taxes"" which must go to fund the service provided to people. When people get older they will not be able to work so they deserve to be helped and to have the ultimate care that they need. For instance, Denmark provide a professional house nurse for people when they turn 65 and a weekly doctor visit if they have chronic diseases. \n Also, most of elderly people suffer from chronic and mental diseases that require a medical intervention that most of the times cannot be afforded by their families due to their high costs. These illnesses cannot be treated by their families as they need special team and medications ,which are expensive, to deal with their conditions . For example, according to Princeton hospital study, 80% of old people have diseases that could cost their families higher than they earn to only control their situation. \n In conclusion, Government in the UK take the responsibility of their own nation to send elderly to special nursery houses. It is agreed that this is a part of the government duty toward their people who spent their lives pay taxes from their own income. Also, this special care cannot be usually provided by their families due to the high cost of it, so government must provide support to this category of people.","your opening statement is a bit in error when it comes to representing the opinion discussion. The prompt is asking you the question ""do you agree?"". The prompt itself does not lend an actual opinion for you to agree with based upon the format of the original prompt discussion presentation. Therefore, you have to frame your opinion as the main discussion point. Your opinion cannot be an agreement opinion as no previous opinion exists in the original. You also presented evidence in the opening statement, which is not allowed due to the lack of discussion development. I think you were not properly oriented regarding the proper method of developing the opening paraphrase. Let me show you an example of one way of paraphrasing this prompt in the expected manner: \n <em>Elderly Britons often go to senior homes in order to live with people of similar ages and also have more professional medical care readily available to them. While some private citizens pay for this care, there are times when the British government ends up paying for the senior care bill. Since there are two types of payments available for senior care, those who pay privately believe that the government should pay for senior care, regardless of the senior's ability to pay. In this essay, I will present supporting reasons for my personal opinion based on personal knowledge that supports having the government pay for the senior home fees in this essay.</em> \n Please make sure that you use the correct word to describe what you want to say. A ""senior home"" is different from a ""nursery home"" . The first one is a home for old people and the latter, is a home for babies. In addition to that, you need to make sure that you write 5 paragraphs in the essay as per the required format for this test. Try to avoid writing run on sentences like you do here. Instead make sure that your sentences completely discuss one thought each. That would be composed of 1 topic sentence, 2 supporting sentences and one example, per paragraph. This will help your GRA score. \n In addition to that. I don't recommend that you write more than 250 words for this type of essay. You need to make sure that you allot at least 10 minutes to review, revise, and edit your essay. Writing more than 250 words will not allow you that liberty and could lower your final score due to lack of technical merit based on the scoring criteria.","This essay aims to discuss whether governments, specifically in the UK, should bear the costs of care homes for the elderly, as opposed to the costs falling on the individual or their family. Here's some focused feedback to enhance the essay further:

1. **Responding to the Topic:** The opening statement needs refinement to more clearly establish a personal stance on the provided topic. Instead of seeming to agree with a pre-existing opinion (which the essay prompt does not provide), the essay should state a personal viewpoint as its thesis. For instance, ""This essay argues that the UK government should cover the costs of care homes for the elderly, given their lifelong contribution to society through taxes and the specialized care needs they may have.""

2. **Clarity and Accuracy:** The term ""nursery houses"" is incorrectly used to refer to homes for the elderly. The more appropriate term is ""senior homes"" or ""care homes."" This distinction is crucial for clarity and accuracy in your argument.

3. **Essay Structure:** The essay's structure could be improved by adhering to the five-paragraph format typically required for such tests. This format includes an introduction, three body paragraphs each with a unique point supported by evidence, and a concluding paragraph. Ensuring each paragraph focuses on one main idea will aid clarity and coherence.

4. **Sentence Structure:** The essay includes some run-on sentences which could hinder clarity. Each sentence should convey a single idea, supported by evidence or examples. Breaking down complex thoughts into simpler, well-structured sentences will enhance readability and effectiveness.

5. **Word Count and Revision Time:** Be mindful of the word count; aiming for around 250 words is advisable to allow time for review and revision. This review process is critical for identifying and correcting errors or weaknesses in the argument, structure, or language use.

6. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are some grammatical errors and stylistic choices that could be refined. For example, ensuring consistency in tense and use of articles can make the text smoother. Consider revising phrases like ""people spend most of their lives pay taxes"" to ""people spend most of their lives paying taxes.""

7. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** The essay presents two main arguments for government-provided elder care: the contribution of the elderly to society through taxes and the specialized care needs that families may not meet. These arguments would benefit from more detailed examples and data to strengthen them. Referencing studies, as done with the Princeton hospital study, adds credibility but ensure that such references are accurately represented and relevant to the UK context.

In summary, focusing on these areas will significantly enhance the essay's clarity, persuasiveness, and adherence to the test's requirements. Reflecting on the structuring of arguments, refining language use, and keeping within the word limit while allowing time for revision are essential steps toward improvement.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

It is happen because there are many opportunities to be an entrepreneur. Although, some people think that work as a employee is the best choice in life. I believe that people who have their own company giving more positive effects than drawbacks. \n Firstly, people who become entrepreneur have flexible time to manage their own business. They can choose what time do the company open and decide when it will be closed. Also, if people have a lot of orders from customer, they can open the company longer than usual. A further benefit is that people can open job opportunity. It is very helpful due to they can decrease the amount of unemployment in their neighbourhood. After that, the government is helped by reducing the rate of poverty level in a country. And of course, the owner of company feels satisfying because they can help other people. \n On the other hand, becoming an entrepreneur has drawbacks effect. First of all is high-risk. It happens because if there is something bad happening, the company easily get bankrupt. Skills are needed to manage the company. Another disadvantage is that there are many competitors that compete to get many profits. The worse think that will occur is criminality. The competitor can do anything to be leader market. \n All in all, I think to be an entrepreneur is more benefits than working in office as an employee. However, someone who wants to start business should think twice about the risk of tax and they must have big capital to make big company and to anticipate if there is a problem in financial sector.","Dear student, it looks to me like this essay would score a decent 5 in an actual test.

You have a tendency to discuss all of your reasons in one paragraph instead of spacing them out. By spacing out your topics, you will be able to present better evidence in support of each evidence presented.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   - There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that could be improved. For instance, ""It is happen because"" should be ""It happens because,"" and ""work as a employee"" should be ""work as an employee.""

   - Be cautious with verb tenses and ensure consistency throughout your essay.

However, there are several areas that require attention to improve the overall quality and effectiveness of the writing. It's essential to address these issues systematically to enhance clarity, coherence, and correctness, making the essay more comprehensible and engaging for the reader.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay attempts to address the given topic by discussing the allocation of resources between the elderly and the young. However, the argument could be made clearer. It is beneficial to directly state the essay's stance in the introduction and then support this stance throughout the essay with clear, consistent reasoning. 

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are numerous grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure, subject-verb agreement, and tense consistency, that significantly hinder comprehension. For example, ""It is common beliefs"" should be ""It is a common belief,"" and ""childrens had a well-educated"" should be ""children have a well-rounded education."" Also, pay attention to the correct use of articles (""a,"" ""an,"" and ""the"") and prepositions (""for,"" ""to,"" etc.). To enhance readability and coherence, sentences should be concise and clear. Using simpler language more accurately can be far more effective than attempting to construct complex sentences with inaccuracies. 

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: While the essay attempts to present a personal standpoint, the argument becomes muddled due to the issues mentioned above. It's crucial to begin by clearly stating your position on the matter and maintaining this perspective consistently throughout the essay, ensuring each paragraph contributes to reinforcing your argument.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay attempts to use statistics and studies to support its claims, which is a good practice. However, in this context, where a personal opinion is being solicited, it is equally important to include personal reasoning and logic to defend one's stance. Make sure that each argument directly supports the thesis statement made in the introduction and is followed by a concrete example or explanation. Remember, clarity and relevance of your arguments are key to persuasive writing.

5. **Improving English Language Proficiency**: To address the English language proficiency, engaging in regular reading and writing practice can be immensely beneficial. Consider enrolling in English as a Second Language (ESL) courses or utilizing online resources to build a stronger foundation in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence construction. Practice writing essays on various topics and seek feedback from teachers or peers to identify and work on specific areas of improvement. 

Finally, the determination to improve and the effort put into practicing writing in English will over time lead to significant improvements.

Regarding to this, the family structure and capacity has altered in order to take part with the times. In my opinion, this is a negative changes which can inflict matters in the housewifery and affect the child's development. Furthermore, it will be discuss below. \n One serious problem that can be arise from the changing in family structure and role is that it can provoke the housewifery problem. For instance, many mothers decide to be a career woman, leave the house, and hand the house affairs over to the assistant. Moreover, some women also require their husbands to handle duties at home and take care of their child. This will be triggered a dispute even to divorce in the household relations. \n Another issue is that it will be interfered the children development. Some studies have reported that many cases of juvenile delinquency caused by the lack of parental function which affects children's development. To illustrate, the modification of roles and structure can be deflected the real function of parents in the family. As a result, the children will endure lack of attention and affection because the parental role is weak. According to this, the transformation in family capacity should be considered in order to avoid several matters in relatives. \n To conclude, although it has common to change family roles and structure, it has brought several problems in the relationship between husband and wife and also impact the children progression.","Dear student, you have a noun phrase problem in this essay. The term ""negative changes"" should have been written as ""negative change"". You need to change the verb form since you presented an auxiliary word ""discuss"". As you are still talking about it, you should say ""will be discussed"" instead. That shows the ongoing status of your presentation. There are several other presentation problems in your essay but I believe that these are the most pressing that need to be addressed in the presentation. \n Your opening paraphrase is a hanging phrase. It ends with a sentence that does not make much sense since yo used the term ""Furthermore"" which means in addition to or besides. You did not add information nor did you expand the discussion. Therefore, this paragraph is short of the 3 sentence minimum paragraph requirement. A clearer and more acceptable paraphrase is: \n <em>The past few decades has shown a change in family dynamics. There are several reasons for this changes which I will be discussing in this essay. Based on the changes that I will be presenting, it appears that there is a negative trend occurring within the family structure.</em> \n In the second paragraph, you did not need the connecting word ""be"" for the first sentence. Simply saying ""can arise"" shows the use of the connecting word ""can"", there is no need to add ""be"" as it is a redundancy. \n Since you are in the present time and discussing this essay, the present tense must be used throughout the references. Therefore, it is not ""interfered"" but ""interfere"". You can say ""can be deflected"" because that phrase does not make sense. Rather say ""can change the real function..."" You should never say ""according to"" unless referring to a statement made by another person. \n You wrote a good concluding summary, but you wrote it as a run on sentence. Next time, separate the presentation into 3 sentences since there is a minimum sentence requirement and you will lose GRA points for writing run-on sentences.","Your essay on the changes in family structure and its impacts provides a valuable topic for discussion. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. Here are specific points of feedback to help improve your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay addresses the topic, which is commendable. However, your argument would be stronger if your introduction more directly stated the reasons for changes in family dynamics and their implications. Consider starting with a clear thesis statement that outlines the negative impacts you will discuss. For example: ""Changes in family dynamics over the past few decades, including altered roles and structures, have led to negative consequences for household harmony and child development.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
   - The phrase ""negative changes"" should be singular: ""negative change"".
   - In the sentence mentioning discussion, instead of ""Furthermore, it will be discuss below,"" it should be ""Furthermore, it will be discussed below.""
   - Avoid using “be” unnecessarily. For example, instead of ""can be arise,"" use ""can arise.""
   - Stay consistent with verb tenses. Instead of ""it will be interfered,"" consider ""it will interfere"" or ""it interferes.""
   - The phrase ""can be deflected"" is unclear. Try using ""can change"" or ""can alter.""
   - Use ""according to"" only when citing someone else's ideas or statements. Instead, you could use ""thus,"" ""therefore,"" or ""as such"" to link your reasoning.

3. **Point of View Clarity:**
   - Your viewpoint is clear but could be expressed more assertively. Support your opinion with more detailed examples or evidence to make your stance more convincing.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:**
   - Aim for more detailed and specific examples when explaining how family structure changes affect household harmony and child development. Instead of broad statements, consider including statistics or findings from studies to strengthen your arguments.
   - Avoid vague expressions like ""affect the child's development"" by specifying which aspects of development are impacted and how.

5. **Overall Structure and Coherence:**
   - The introduction could be more engaging and informative. A revised introduction could outline the key points that will be discussed, setting a foundation for the reader.
   - Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that all sentences within the paragraph support that main idea.
   - To avoid run-on sentences and improve the readability of your conclusion, break down complex ideas into simpler, standalone sentences.

6. **General Advice:**
   - Remember to meet the minimum sentence requirement in each paragraph to ensure your ideas are fully developed.
   - Practice using transitions effectively to improve the flow between sentences and paragraphs.

4338,https://essayforum.com/writing/formal-academic-qualifications-life-80200/,test,IELTS TASK 2: formal academic qualifications VS life experience or personal qualities.,"In this increasingly competitive society, high-level qualifications are considered to be more expected than life experience or personal qualities by some employers when they seek new candidates these days. In my perspective point of view, I believe that this is a negative movement. \n There are two factors to explain why recruiters put formal academic certifications as top priorities when recruiting new employees. Firstly, in many professions, a university degree is needed for a specific job. A student has to devote a lot of time and effort to his or her study in order to get a university qualification which somehow prove that this student is a hard-working and persevering person. For instance, a candidate for biology teacher position is required to have a great deal of knowledge at university as well as spend a lot of time to practice and carry out experiments. Secondly, this tendency might be a great way for a recruiter to save time finding top-notch applicants. Selecting the candidates base on common criteria certificates is necessary for screening the good candidates from a large applicant pool before employers find their excellent and right employee. Compared to formal academic candidates who are likely ready to start working, employers may have to spend time on training non-academic applicants how to work properly. \n However, I think that this is a negative development and recruiters should consider a mix of factors, including education background, work experience and personalities. Many people decide to work right after school instead of starting tertiary education in order to gain life skills and practical experience. On top of that, after a long time of working in a real work environment, people are also capable of doing most assigned tasks without a formal academic education. In addition, warmth and smiles indicate the type of employee who will work well with others. An unhappy worker takes more time to finish the quest, does only the minimum to avoid being fired while a happy worker finds value in the work they do, and do the best they can to finish it. \n In conclusion, compared with qualifications, life experience and personal traits are considered less important criterion for employers to assess potential employees, and I believe that this is a negative progress for the above-mentioned arguments.","Hey, I'd like to tell you not to worry about your score. I have thoroughly reviewed your essay and, based upon the scoring requirements, I can safely tell you that you will get at least a 6 with this type of writing. That is because you stayed on point with your discussions and you managed to remain clear and relevant with your 2 points for discussion. However, there are some points that you need to consider improving upon in order to improve your scoring potential. \n The first thing that you have to consider is that when you deal with a direct question essay, of which this particular exercise is one, you should make sure to indicate not only your position regarding the topic, but also the main discussion points you will be presenting. That is because the opening paragraph, which requires at least 2 sentences to represent the prompt paraphrase, you also need to add the discussion outline by indicating your position and the discussion points towards the end of the paragraph. This helps inform the reader as to what the flow of the discussion will be and how it will be presented. \n The next thing you have to remember is that redundancies need to be avoided in your presentation. While I understand your desire to increase your LR score, repeating information in the essay will not be helpful because it shows a lack of control with regards to word usage and grammar development. For example, when you said: \n <quotation>In my perspective point of view</quotation> \n The term ""perspective"" already means point of view. It is a synonym word so when you said ""perspective point of view"" you created a redundancy in the presentation. \n Your body of paragraphs are acceptable and does make valid points. However, you presented too many points in one paragraph which did not allow you to really fully explain the purpose of the paragraph. It would be better if you pick only up to 3 strongest discussion points to present in individual paragraphs so that you can clearly explain your meaning. It is not enough to list discussion points with single sentence explanations. You need to fully explain using a topic sentence, reasoning, and clear example. All of those 3 points need to be interrelated in the paragraph with the final sentence being an introduction to the upcoming discussion topic in the next paragraph. \n Overall, you did acceptable work in this essay. It shows that you have the potential to score even greater in the actual test. You just need to practice writing in the various forms to make sure that you will get at least a 6 in all the test question formats.","Your essay tackles the topic effectively, staying focused and relevant throughout its entirety. This focus and relevance are your strengths, reflecting a clear understanding and response to the given topic, which is a positive aspect likely to contribute to a favorable assessment.

However, there are several areas in which improvements could be made to enhance the overall quality and scoring potential of your essay:

1. **Introduction and Thesis Statement**: It's important to not only state your position but also outline the main points you intend to discuss right from the introduction. Incorporating a thesis statement that does so clearly would guide the reader through your argumentation more effectively. For example, rather than simply stating your view, you could say, ""This essay will argue that while qualifications are essential, a balanced consideration of experience and personal qualities is equally important.""

2. **Avoiding Redundancies**: Be cautious with your word choice to avoid repeating the same idea, which can detract from the precision and clarity of your writing. An example pointed out in your essay is the phrase ""in my perspective point of view,"" where ""perspective"" and ""point of view"" mean the same thing. Simplifying to ""from my perspective"" would eliminate the redundancy and strengthen your sentence.

3. **Developing Your Arguments Fully**: While your essay presents several interesting points, they often feel crowded within paragraphs without thorough explanation or support. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, focus on developing a smaller number of key points more fully in individual paragraphs. Each point should be introduced with a topic sentence, supported with reasoning and clear examples, and concluded in a way that leads to the next point or paragraph. This approach will allow you to explore each argument in greater depth and demonstrate your understanding more effectively.

4. **Balanced and Coherent Structure**: Ensure your essay progresses logically from one point to the next, adequately concluding each argument before moving onto the next. This structure applies both within paragraphs and across the essay as a whole. It will make your writing more cohesive and ensure that your reader can easily follow and understand your line of reasoning.

Remember, your essay already possesses the fundamental strengths of staying on topic and presenting a clear argument. By focusing on these areas of improvement—clarity and structure, avoiding redundancies, and thoroughly developing your points—you will likely enhance the quality and impact of your writing. This practice will not only elevate your score in the test but also improve your writing skills overall. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to see progress in your ability to articulate complex ideas effectively.",4,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

While many believe that it should be done to ensure public health, others maintain that they should not intervene business activity as well as people's living. Given that this food trend can bring adverse impact and the government are obligated to ensure people's health, I strongly agree that a higher tax should be imposed to raise the effectiveness on preventing citizens from over-consuming unhealthy fast food. \n Concerning the negative effect, fast food restaurants sell extremely high calories food. As an example, McDonald's sell deep fried french fries, soda with high sugar content and unhealthy burger. They contain exceedingly high calories by which nutritionists said that a McDonald's cheeseburger with fries already exceeded the daily suggested sodium level intake. At best, costumers will be overweighted. At worst, they will suffer from chronic disease like coronary heart disease and diabetes. Raising the price allow people to think twice before buying them. Therefore, a higher selling price can impede citizens from eating foods with high fat content. \n Regarding government's responsibility, they are responsible to ensure people's health. Given that high calories fast food can bring detrimental and even irreversible impact, the government should act on it by reducing the temptations. For instance, Hong Kong currently has a high duty on tobacco so as to control the number of smokers. In fact, the harmfulness of fast food is no less than that of cigarette. As a result, as a responsible government, raising the tax on unhealthy food can ensure the public's physical health. \n Having discussed the harm on eating fast food and government's responsibility, I firmly believe that the officials should spare no efforts preventing citizens from harming their health through high calories foods. If the government could do so, I am confident that the obesity rate as well as the number of people suffering from chronic diseases could decline significantly.","Where did the obesity topic come from? There is a general reference to health concerns in the original discussion, you should not have changed the topic in your restatement. \n There is no need to discuss the negative effects in the manner that you did. Rather, the negative effect should be mentioned in short form, only as a reference point for the increased taxes. You could have done better in your first reasoning paragraph. Rather, you should be discussing 2 separate topic paragraphs that will simply support the strength of your agreement with the proposal (higher tax on fast food). You had too much emphasis on the health discussion when the focus should have been mostly on the benefits that increased taxes would afford the public such as: \n <em>""Higher quick food taxes would result in health benefits for the people. Rather than reaching for the soda which, when drank regularly could result in Diabetes, the person could reach for a bottle of distilled water instead as a cheaper and healthier alternative. The same goes for the high calorie foods. Instead of a Whopper Burger, the person would opt for the much healthier Apple instead. Thus creating a healthier lifestyle for the person, all because of the way that the junk meals will no longer be as affordable as these currently are. ""</em> \n Your first discussion paragraph created an accidental prompt deviation because you said ""Concerning the negative effect"" instead of using a more relevant topic sentence such as; ""Higher convenient food taxes will result in a healthier person because..."" . Explain how the food tax will help create a healthier person. Always stay on point. Use the actual topic in various forms to represent the discussion topic. For the second paragraph, the discussion topic should have been; ""Given that high calories fast food can bring detrimental and even irreversible impact, the government should act on it by reducing the temptations."" Then proceed to discuss the benefits of the food tax in terms of lessening the temptation to eat food on the go. \n Your essay deviated from the original prompt yet again in the concluding paraphrase. Why did you decide to focus on obesity when it was not mentioned in the original prompt? This misunderstanding of the prompt discussion format on your part is what will cause this essay to get a low score.","Your essay offers a persuasive argument on the necessity of imposing a higher tax on fast food to combat obesity rates and promote public health. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the essay's clarity, relevance, and impact.

1. **Topic Relevance:** The original topic centers on whether officials should implement a higher tax on fast food chains to address obesity. Ensure your essay sticks closely to this discussion. Your introduction rightly sets up this debate, but there are sections where the focus shifts mainly to the health effects of fast food rather than directly linking these effects to how higher taxes could mitigate the problem. It's essential to keep the essay aligned with the original prompt throughout.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Your essay maintains a good level of grammatical correctness, but some minor errors and stylistic choices could be refined for better readability and professionalism. For example, consider simplifying complex sentences and directly addressing how the tax increase could lead to healthier consumer choices, making your argument more straightforward and compelling.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your stance on the imposition of higher taxes on fast food chains is clear and consistently maintained throughout the essay. This is a strength, as it leaves the reader in no doubt about your position. However, reinforcing your viewpoint with more direct arguments on how this approach could specifically lead to better health outcomes would strengthen your essay further.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** Your essay presents some strong arguments, particularly the negative health effects of fast food and the government's role in public health. However, focusing more on how higher taxes on fast food could directly lead to healthier lifestyle choices would make your argument more robust. For instance, explaining how increased prices could make healthier options more appealing or feasible for consumers would directly support your thesis. Moreover, presenting a balanced view by briefly acknowledging potential counterarguments—such as the economic impact on low-income families—and then refuting them, could add depth to your analysis.

5. **Conclusion:** The closing paragraph should succinctly restate the original topic and your thesis, summarizing the main reasons for your stance without introducing new information. This would strengthen the coherence of your essay and ensure it concludes on a focused note. 

By addressing these areas—particularly staying closer to the topic by explaining how increased taxes on fast food could lead directly to healthier choices, and refining the structure and clarity of your arguments—your essay would not only respond more directly to the prompt but also present a more persuasive and well-rounded argument.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

In taking both perspectives into account, I find myself leaning towards the former outlook. \n On the one hand, choosing a particular job and pursuing it for a long period of time generate tremendous beneficial outcomes. The key rationale is that those who spend most of their time in one job are more likely to have rich occupational experience. As a result, they gain a lot of fame or praise from others and soon get promotion prospects from their employees, which enhance their salary package to cover their bills. In addition to this, once working for a long time in a specific field, people get job security and save their precious time to pursue their true passion in life in lieu of spending time finding a new job. As a matter of fact, these valuable time can be spent on looking after their own family, taking up a new hobby or going traveling to broaden their horizons. \n On the other hand, exploring new career paths frequently produces more detrimental risks than benefits. On the bright side, it helps people to fulfill their interest and have an opportunity to work in a new environment. However, its demerits exceed its merits. The key factor is that some recruiters sometimes do not believe candidates who frequently switch occupational interests. Those who change career paths on a frequent basis may be seen as impatient and ""easy come, easy go"" people. Hence, they are not highly evaluated and are less likely to get a chance participating in the company's important tasks. As a consequence, those workers can not experience great fulfillment in work and they are soon dissatisfied with their current job. \n In conclusion, while finding new career paths usually exists to satisfy one's desire, I do believe that it is an optimal decision to get an appropriate job and pursue it in the long term.","<quotation>sparks off an intense debate in modern society</quotation> \n This statement will cost you point deductions in the TA section. There is no reference to such a thing in the original presentation. In fact, this statement has changed the discussion considerations from the original prompt, creating a separation between your interpretation and the first version of the topic.

Your opinion will receive a failing score. You are asked to respond in a measured extent manner, something that you failed to do in your opinion presentation. \n The actual discussion is also incorrect since you did not provide the correct single opinion defense in the presentation. You used a comaparison discussion, meaning you failed to address the prompt writing instructions. So the essay will not receive a passing score. You did not follow the correct writing instructions.","The essay provides an engaging discussion on whether one should stick to a particular job for fulfillment or explore new career paths. Here is a breakdown of feedback focusing on the four main aspects:

1. **Response to the Topic:** The opening statement suggests a debate in modern society which might not directly relate to the specific prompt given. It’s important for the essay to directly address the topic from the start. The prompt requires a clear stance or opinion, but the essay seems to present a comparative discussion instead. This approach diverges from the expected format of strictly defending a single viewpoint. Ensuring that the essay directly and accurately responds to the prompt is crucial for meeting the task's requirements.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written with minor errors. However, attention to detail can improve clarity and readability. For example, in the phrase ""enhance their salary package to cover their bills,"" consider specifying the subject more clearly to avoid confusion. Also, be cautious of singular and plural agreement in sentences such as ""these valuable time can be spent,"" where it should be ""this valuable time can be spent."" Improvements in these areas will refine the essay's quality.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay leans towards the perspective of sticking to a single job for greater fulfillment. However, the clarity of this stance could be enhanced by directly stating it in response to the essay prompt, rather than implying it through a comparative analysis of both viewpoints. Clearly articulating your standpoint at the beginning and reiterating it in the conclusion can strengthen the essay's persuasiveness.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position:** The essay offers arguments for both sides before stating a preference for one. While this provides a rounded view, the task requires a focused defense of a single opinion. Instead of comparing, devote the essay to building a case for the chosen perspective with clear, descriptive arguments and examples. This ensures alignment with the task's instructions and maximizes the essay's effectiveness.

In summary, while the essay is thought-provoking and well-composed, aligning more closely with the specific requirements of the prompt, opting for a direct and singular perspective, and refining grammatical precision can significantly improve its effectiveness. Directly stating and consistently supporting your viewpoint with clear, specific arguments will not only enhance clarity but also the persuasiveness of your essay.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative
4341,https://essayforum.com/writing/number-offences-mainly-committed-youngsters-94386/,test,"The number of offences, mainly committed by youngsters, is on the rise in most parts of the world","The number of offences, especially committed by youngsters, is on the rise in most parts of the world. There are some possible causes for this trend, and several remedies appear to be open to us. \n Perhaps the major factor is the increasing influence of negative entertaining products such as horror games and films portraying killings and hurting. In the past, it was hard to come across such extreme examples of crime when there are no internet, meaning there are no bad examples for people to follow. But now, it appears to be easier than ever to access or chance upon media that contains criminal acts which may lead to the normalization of crime, thus increases the chance of committing crimes among people. A further cause is the lack of supervision on the use of such products, especially among young people under 18. This seems to stem from the fact that most parents nowadays are too busy to look after their kids that children are more susceptible to the progressively stimulating and easy-to-access products like this. \n Turning to possible solutions, it would seem unfeasible to completely erase the crime-related contents from such medias as some of this, for example the award-winning game Resident Evils, have made huge contributions to the industry of game and culture that they now have become irremovable symbols. I would rather think putting a restriction on the access to these products, for instance by age-rating or warning about the graphic contents, would encourage people to think twice before turning to it. Secondly, parents should perhaps spend more time to control the use of such media among their children. This can be done by blocking specific websites that contain harmful graphics which will lessen exposure to malicious media in children. A further solution might be to raise awareness and educate people, especially children, about the consequences of crime so that they will not commit crime in the first place. \n In summary, the factors of harmful entertaining media and lack of supervision on the use of such products appear to be the main causes. Restrictions on access to those things and education on retribution for crime may well lessen the severity of the situation.","The topic restatement is almost word for word accurate, even in word placemen. The synonyms used were perfect for the reinterpretation. However, the writer's opinion merely restates the writing questions, rather than providinc comprehensive responses to the given questions. A quick response to the cause and solution was required not only for the preliminary outline of the discussion, but also to show that the writer clearly understood what the writing intructions are. Minus points for not providing a proper thesis statement to represent a clear writer's opinion. \n Uncertainty has no place in a cause and solution essay. You need to represent your opinion and reasons with conviction. That means, using words of uncertainy such as ""perhaps"" defeats the definite purpose of the discussion and the convicing manner with which you are expected to represent your explanation. Deductions will apply since you are not even convinced of the validity of your own opinion and therefore, you are leaving the reader confused as to your discussion points. Support your discussions strongly or lose points for not doing so. \n Problems with the GRA section can also be found. A properly written paper does not start sentences with conjunctions such as ""but"". A conjunction is used as a sentence idea binder. Since there are no 2 connected but different ideas to be bound at the start of a sentence, such words should not be used in that paragraph position. \n Further problems are to be found in this failing score presentation. However, the most evident and easiest to correct have been presented for your information here. I hope to see improvements with your next writing.","The essay addresses the topic by exploring the causes and solutions related to the increase in offenses committed by youngsters. It uses synonyms effectively and closely aligns with the topic by discussing the influence of media and lack of supervision as primary causes, alongside proposing restrictions and education as solutions.

However, the essay lacks a clear thesis statement, which is crucial for outlining the author's main argument or stance. Including a concise thesis statement in the introduction could significantly enhance the essay's focus and clarity. 

Another issue is the use of uncertain language, such as ""perhaps"" and ""would seem.” This weakens the argument by suggesting a lack of conviction in the proposed ideas. It's essential to state opinions and reasons confidently to make a compelling and persuasive argument. Removing uncertainty from the language will make the arguments stronger and more convincing.

Furthermore, there are grammar, style, and accuracy issues that need attention. For instance, starting sentences with conjunctions like ""but"" is inappropriate because conjunctions are meant to connect ideas within or across sentences, not to start sentences. Additionally, consistency in verb tense and subject-verb agreement needs improvement. For example, ""there are no internet"" should be corrected to ""there was no internet.""

The essay could also benefit from more detailed support for its arguments. While it mentions the influence of media and the role of parental supervision, it could provide more concrete examples or data to strengthen these points. Expanding on how specific media influences behavior or detailing how increased supervision could deter crime would make the arguments more credible and descriptive.

Lastly, while the essay mentions solutions, there is a need for deeper exploration and justification of these solutions. For example, discussing the practicality of implementing age restrictions or the potential impact of educational programs would provide a more well-rounded and thorough analysis.

Overall, the essay has a strong foundation but can be improved by incorporating a concise thesis statement, adopting a more confident tone, correcting grammatical/stylistic issues, and providing more detailed support for its arguments. These changes would enhance the clarity, persuasiveness, and overall quality of the essay.",3,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Maybe computers will help students feel more comfortable, convienient,.. or computers may teach them more effective than teacher, but teachers know how to handle their student's emotion. For example : teachers can motivate their students to learn better, or they can help their students to achieve much success now as well as in the future. Plus, If we use computer in education, students will not know how to interact with one another anymore. They may improve their knowledge , but they will become a machine without emotions. \n My second assessment is "" If computers are money, teachers would be gems, and money does not glitter "". Basically, teachers can show expressions that highlights key points. They also have the ability to correct students and can clear doubts, But computers can not. Moreover, students can get the opportunity to help a teacher, and the teacher can share their expieriences about life, in education,.. with their students. Plus, teachers is more like a friend who give students knowledge, help students achive their dreams, guide students in the path of learning,... And by the way, who wants to replace a friend with a machine ? \n In conclusion, I want to say that we should not and must not replace teachers with computers.

It presents a clear stance against this idea, emphasizing the value of human interaction and emotional support in education. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and grammar accuracy.

1. **Grammar and Spelling Corrections:**
   - Careful attention needs to be paid to the usage of conjunctions and punctuation. Avoid starting sentences with ""Because"" and using commas followed by ellipses. Opt for one punctuation mark and ensure it is used correctly.
   - Capitalization errors are present. Only proper nouns, the beginning of sentences, and specific titles should be capitalized. Avoid unnecessary capitalization within sentences.
   - Spelling mistakes detract from the essay's professionalism. For instance, ""convienient"" should be corrected to ""convenient."" Always proofread to catch and correct such errors.
   - The essay would benefit from understanding the difference between ""I can not"" and ""cannot."" Generally, ""cannot"" is preferred in formal writing.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - The comparison phrase, ""If computers are money, teachers would be gems, and money does not glitter,"" is creative but may be confusing. It's crucial to ensure idioms or metaphors used are clear to an English-speaking audience and are well-explained within the context.
   - Aim for more coherent argumentation. Ensure each argument is clearly stated and directly supports the main thesis against the replacement of teachers with computers.

3. **Argument Development:**
   - While the essay makes valid points regarding the emotional and social learning advantages of human teachers over computers, these arguments could be more developed. Providing more detailed examples or evidence could strengthen the case.
   - Discuss further how computers cannot replicate the mentorship and guidance that teachers offer. This could involve more specific scenarios or benefits of human interaction in the learning process.

4. **Stylistic Suggestions:**
   - The essay's tone and style are generally appropriate, conveying a conversational yet persuasive argument. However, refining the essay's structure, such as clearer paragraph transitions and a more formal introduction and conclusion, could improve readability.
   - Reflect on the essay's flow. Ensure each paragraph logically leads to the next, with clear connections between your points and the overall thesis.

Competitiveness or cooperativeness?,"Nowadays, many concern that children should compete each other in someways, while some other suggest that children need to be taught to co-operate. In my point of view, these two ways to educate the young are both important in different situation. \n I believe that when children accomplish a task as a a group, they can acquire some abilities of communication, improve the skill of being a leader, and learn to interact with other properly. For example, in class we need to report a presentation in a group. We have to divide the task to a small one, then assign it to each member. In this case, we need to find everyone's specialties and debate when should we have a meeting or a deadline. Everyone should work hard for the group not for itself, and consider the result of one's laziness or arrogance. \n On the other hand, it is also very effective method for children to have motivation to improve skills by competition. Though the system of racing with other people, children would have more awareness that ""Others are better,so I need to catch up on them."" For example,in a basketball team there are only five people who can be on the court. So when you have a chance, you will not just let it go, and if you can not be called, you must will practice harder to improve your skills. \n In short, each teaching technique has its reason to make every child more skillful, useful, and even better in their future.","you once again failed to understand the prompt requirements. You turned a comparison and opinion essay into a purely opinion essay instead. The prompt clearly states that you are to discuss both sides and then give your opinion. The resulting paragraphs would have produced a total of 5 paragraphs. You only have 2 complete paragraphs and two sentence lines. Obviously, you will not pass this exam because of the big mistake in the discussion style. I predict that you will not get higher than a 4 in this instance. You must always double check the prompt requirements before you submit the essay. Make sure that the instructions for the discussion are completely followed. You always neglect to check yourself before submission. If you continue to submit essays without double checking the content and prompt requirements during the practice test, the chances are that you will make the same mistake in the actual test, which would result in you failing the all important test. Do not be careless. Be careful and treat the practice tests like the actual test. There is a reason that it is called a practice test. This allows you to make mistakes that you can learn from in order to improve your weak points before the actual test.","**Final Feedback:**

It's essential to closely examine the instructions for your essay. Your essay does tend to lean heavily towards sharing your own opinion, rather than evenly discussing both competing and cooperating among children, as the prompt suggests. The essay structure expected for a topic like this typically involves a balanced discussion on both views followed by your personal opinion, totaling in a structure that ideally should have five paragraphs: an introduction, a discussion of the first view, a discussion of the second view, your opinion, and then a conclusion. The text provided only comprises two main paragraphs and introductory sentences, indicating a deviation from the expected structure.

There are noticeable spelling and grammar errors throughout your essay. For example, ""concern"" should be ""concerns,"" and ""someways"" is more correctly expressed as ""in some ways."" Watch out for repeated articles such as in ""a a group,"" where only one ""a"" is necessary. Attention to such details can significantly enhance the clarity and professionalism of your writing.

Your point of view appears in the essay; however, it intertwines with the discussion of the two perspectives without clear separation. This approach can confuse readers about when you are presenting general viewpoints versus your personal stance. A more structured separation of these elements would improve the clarity of your message.

The arguments provided do have descriptive elements that support your view, showcasing some advantages of both competition and cooperation. Yet, these arguments could be enhanced with a more varied range of examples and a deeper analysis of how these methods impact children's development. For instance, discussing the specific skills children gain from competition and cooperation would strengthen your argument.

Finally, always review the essay prompt to ensure full compliance with the task requirements. Practice with a critical eye towards following instructions precisely, as overlooking them can significantly impact your performance in both practice and actual examinations. The practice is a crucial time to make and learn from mistakes. Therefore, engaging with practice essays as though they are the actual exam will prepare you better for the real scenario.

Improving upon these areas will not only help in adhering more closely to the prompt requirements but also in enhancing the quality of your essays in general.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

In addition to that, you do not have enough English vocabulary knowledge to know when you are not using the correct translated word in the sentence. One of the most confusing presentations in your essay is: \n <em>While the news on the internet are divided many spices and have many sources different, unknown.</em> \n This is a hanging sentence that is lacking a secondary subject.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to strengthen the essay and make the argument more compelling and easier to understand.

Firstly, the essay suffers from grammatical, spelling, and stylistic issues that hinder clear communication. For instance, the phrase ""Information technology are"" should be ""Information technology is"" since 'technology' is a singular noun. Attention to verb agreement and the correct use of singular and plural forms will greatly improve sentence structure.

The choice of vocabulary can also confuse readers. An example of this is the use of ""spices"" instead of the correct term ""spaces"" or ""sections"" when referring to how information is organized on the internet. Ensuring the correct words are used for the intended meaning is crucial for clarity. Additionally, sentences like “While the news on the internet are divided many spices and have many sources different, unknown” are confusing due to misplaced words and incorrect grammar. A clearer way to express this thought could be, ""News on the internet is divided into many sections and often comes from various, sometimes unknown, sources.""

The essay's structure could also be refined for better coherence and flow. The use of transitional phrases and a more logical organization of thoughts would help in guiding the reader through the essay smoothly. For example, before jumping into arguments, briefly introduce what the essay will discuss and why it's important. This will prepare readers for what's to come and help connect your points more effectively.

The point of view of the author is somewhat clear - there is a preference for newspapers over digital news - yet the arguments supporting this view need to be more descriptive and robust. For each point made in support of newspapers (credibility, inclusiveness, etc.), providing specific examples or further explanation would strengthen the argument. For instance, when discussing the credibility of newspapers due to their regulation, details about this process and how it enhances the information's reliability could be more convincing.

Some people may not have access to digital devices, making newspapers essential for their access to information. While this is a valuable point, it could be expanded by discussing potential solutions or the importance of ensuring that all members of society have equal access to information, whether through digital means or traditional ones.

To improve the essay, focus on simple, clear sentences that express one idea at a time. Avoid directly translating phrases from another language into English, as this often leads to confusion. Instead, aim for simplicity and clarity. Reading widely in English can also help in understanding how sentences are structured and ideas are conveyed.

In summary, by addressing these issues - refining the grammar and vocabulary, ensuring clear and logical argumentation, and using a coherent structure - the essay will be significantly improved.

On the stylistic front, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that need attention. Phrases like ""as world is changing"" could be revised to ""as the world is changing"" for clarity and correctness. Also, ensuring consistency in tense and proper article usage will make the essay easier to read and understand.

It's also noticed that there are sentences directly copied from the prompt without rephrasing. In academic writing, it's important to express ideas in your own words and demonstrate your understanding of the topic. Practicing paraphrasing skills will be beneficial and will help to avoid lower scores in language proficiency assessments.

The viewpoint of the author is somewhat clear but could be more explicit. After discussing both views, a concluding paragraph does present a personal stance; however, it would be more effective if this opinion were directly linked to the discussed viewpoints. Moreover, introducing this opinion earlier and weaving it throughout would make for a more compelling argument.

To elevate this essay, ensure that instructions are thoroughly understood and followed, work on paraphrasing and using your own words to express ideas, and focus on providing clear, well-supported arguments for your views. Additionally, paying attention to grammatical details will significantly improve the overall quality of your writing.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Take a risk.,"no success without risk? \n In modern society taking a risk is usually presented as a good thing, as an opportunity to express yourself and bring innovation. But as much as society praises the courage to show your ideas, most of the time in actuality there are some repercussions. \n The greatest innovators have started in less than stellar conditions. The biggest companies - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google have started in a basement or a garage. And their creators have often, in the beginning, been looked at as being the crazy inventor type of people that were constantly bombarded by the heavy hammer of social judgement. For an idea, no matter how good or revolutionary, to take shape it must be correctly presented and navigated onto the cold waters of society. \n The presentation of the idea, some would argue, is far more important than the idea itself, and I am inclined to agree with them. Take, by way of example, Thomas Edison. The famed American inventor who rose to prominence in the late 19th century because of his successes. For a long time he was widely acclaimed as the creator of many innovations, the most important of which was the light bulb. Nowadays we are offered a new view of his supposed creations, with the claims that Edison stole Nikola Tesla's inventions. But even with this information Thomas Edison will remain in history as the person who managed to bring the light bulb on the global stage and dethrone the millennial old non-electric light sources. \n In our modern age we are faced with a new challenge of equal, if not greater proportions, and that is fossil fuels. Climate change has become a problem of global magnitude and yet we hardly do much to change our current ways. The use of fossil fuels has become so entrenched in our society that most people cannot imagine a world without the roaring engines and the black smoke. Some say that there is no alternative to the current status quo, that no solution can fully replace the lifeblood of the world's economy. But others have decided to take a risk and try to present a realistic solution. The biggest proponent for post fossil fuel future is Elon Musk, who has not only created a viable electric car, but also a brand around it. The Tesla brand is the biggest attempt to make people see electric cars not as a sci fi futuristic idea, but as a reality. \n While this is a great way to popularize an idea it also shows the need to","Dear student, when the essay prompt asked you to take a risk, what the instruction meant was for you to discuss something that you had taken a risk on. Something that will help the reviewer understand the kind of risk taker you are. Are you a non-risk taker, a moderate risk-taker, or a full-out, devil may care, I'll only live once kind of risk taker. You are not being asked to discuss risk, its factors, well-known risk takers, and the like. Your mindset as a person who takes a chance is what the reviewer wishes to get to know better in this essay. All of the essay prompts focus on one subject alone. YOU. You are always the main personality in all the essays because you are the one being interviewed for admission to the university. Not other people, not your understanding of others. Just you and your understanding of yourself. Don't muddle the issue. I can see why you might have been confused since the prompt is very general in coverage. You were right to ask for help because not everyone could have understood what the general prompt wanted in relation to specifics.","The essay presents an interesting discussion on the importance of taking risks and provides examples of notable figures who have succeeded because of their willingness to embrace risks. But there are a few areas where improvements could make the essay more aligned with what's expected and enhance clarity and impact.

1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears there's a misinterpretation of the essay prompt. The focus is meant to be on a personal experience with taking a risk, highlighting your own attitude and actions towards risk-taking. It's essential to share your personal story or a specific instance where you took a risk, explaining how that reflects on your character, rather than discussing the concept of risk in a broad sense or citing examples of famous risk-takers.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay is well-written with a good flow, but attention to detail in grammar and spelling is crucial. Checking for typos or grammatical errors can polish your essay further. Additionally, using simpler language can help convey your ideas more directly and clearly, making your essay more accessible, especially considering the English language learner context.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** While your essay beautifully outlines the significance of risk in innovation and societal progress, it doesn't clearly express your personal stance on risk-taking. Reflecting on and stating your own experiences with risk can provide a clearer view of your perspective and make the essay more personal and engaging.

4. **Support for Your Position:** The essay effectively uses historical and contemporary examples to discuss the role of risk in achieving success. However, without personal examples, it lacks the direct support needed for your specific viewpoint on risk-taking. Including a personal anecdote or a detailed example from your life where you faced a risk and how you dealt with it, réussi or failed, would strengthen your argument by showing rather than telling.

In summary, refocusing the essay to highlight your personal experiences with risk, ensuring grammatical accuracy, simplifying your language for clarity, and directly supporting your viewpoint with personal examples will significantly enhance your essay. Reflecting more on your experiences and how they shape your understanding of taking risks will provide a unique and compelling response that aligns with the prompt's intentions.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,2,Argumentative
4347,https://essayforum.com/writing/decision-pregnancy-termination-prohibited-93201/,test,The decision of whether pregnancy termination should be prohibited or not,"When it comes to the decision of whether pregnancy termination should be prohibited or not, opinions differ among people. Although it may have some negative effects, I believe that it is more advantageous if they allow abortion. \n On the one hand, abortion ban has a good influence on individuals and society. It is such a dangerous procedure that the mothers could be put at high risk for some health problems like infection, bleeding, heart diseases, and so on. Even if the operations are conducted legally at hospitals with high expertise doctors and good medical conditions, these risks are just minimized, not wholly disappear. Furthermore, pregnancy termination is considered to be murder. As life is likely to start at the beginning stage of pregnancy, putting an end to it means killing a person. \n On the other hand, this method should be legal for some benefits. To begin with, abortion can help prevent women from poor living conditions when they are not in a position to give birth to their children. Some may suffer from financial problems due to unemployment and the responsibility to pay for baby nurture expenses such as milk, clothes, or education. Whereas, a large number of teenage moms, especially in the least developed countries like Pakistan, will be forced to leave school and get married early, which could drive them to a future of joblessness and poverty. Moreover, abortion could save women from mental breakdown, depression, or even suicide in case of unintended pregnancy, for example, as a result of rape or forced marriage. Another advantage is that it ensures the rights of women to make decisions about their bodies. As the unborn baby in the womb is a part of the mother's body, no one other than women can ultimately decide whether to bear or not. \n In conclusion, it seems to me that abortion should be permitted to enhance life's quality and guarantee the execution of women's rights.","There is a complete lack of pronoun usage in this essay which indicates that the public opinions were not properly considered in the discussion presentations. All of the information stems only from the personal opinion of the writer. Where ""Discuss both views"" are indicated, the keywords ""Some people"" and ""others"" indicate the points of view to be referenced in the reasoning paragraphs. These indicators require the use of group pronouns in the presentation to allow for a defined method of presenting both supporting and dissenting opinions. The writer must use first person references whenever needed to indicate the separation of 3 opinions in the presentation: the public in support, the public in opposition, and the writer's point of view. The summary conclusion is also too brief to be considered a proper recap of the discussion. Aim to write 3 sentences composed of 40 words next time. That means, properly summarize the topic, discussion points, and a closing sentence to end the paper.","Your essay on the topic of whether pregnancy termination should be prohibited provides a comprehensive view, articulating both sides of the argument. However, there are improvements that can be made to enhance clarity, persuasiveness, and adherence to the essay prompt. Here are some specific points to consider:

1. **Response to the Topic**: You have indeed addressed the topic, presenting arguments for and against the prohibition of abortion. However, the presentation of these arguments could be more balanced. The essay prompt often suggests discussing various viewpoints (""Discuss both views"") before sharing your own. This approach involves clearly indicating when you are presenting others' opinions and when you are sharing your personal stance. Introducing perspectives with phrases like ""Some people believe"" or ""Others argue"" before elaborating on your view could enhance the clarity of your argument structure.

2. **Pronoun Usage and Clarity of Opinion**: Your essay predominantly reflects your perspective without explicitly acknowledging the diversity of public opinion on the matter. Introducing group pronouns (e.g., ""some,"" ""others,"" ""many"") can help distinguish between general opinions and your viewpoint. Also, using the first-person pronoun (""I"") selectively can clearly demarcate your personal position from the rest of the argument. This technique ensures that your opinion stands out clearly against the backdrop of the broader debate.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written but watch out for run-on sentences and ensure clarity in your argumentation. Considering simpler sentence structures can aid in maintaining the focus of your arguments and avoiding potential grammatical pitfalls. Additionally, attention to transition words (""Furthermore,"" ""Moreover"") can help improve the flow between your arguments.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments are descriptive, particularly when discussing the implications of banned or permitted abortions. To strengthen them, incorporate specific examples, statistics, or credible studies to back your claims. This evidence can provide a solid foundation for your arguments, making them more persuasive.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion succinctly states your stance but could be developed further. A well-rounded conclusion recaps the topic, summarizes key discussion points, and reiterates your opinion, thus providing closure. Aim for a more extended conclusion that encapsulates the essence of the essay more comprehensively. A three-sentence structure could serve this purpose effectively—outline the topic, synthesize the main arguments from both perspectives, and conclude with a strong, reflective statement on your viewpoint.

In summary, while your essay demonstrates an understanding of the topic, paying closer attention to the presentation of various viewpoints, clarity of your personal stance, and the conclusiveness of your argument can significantly improve your essay.

Some countries held this idea that it has beneficial effect on country where people earn a lot of money, others advocate this approach that salaries must be supervised and restricted by government. However, In my opinion, high salaries can create some financial difficulties for governments benefetis in terms of economy and social issues exceed detrimental sides. \n There is thought that if governments are willing to make strong their countries they have to provide opportunity their citizens for job satisfication and to make a lot of money. The power of countries rely on citizens' social and economic status which in turn vary from person to person due to financial conditions of people. When human being could be well-worthy they spent their money entertainmet issues and purchase other goods as well as food stuffs, hence, it bring about to evolve other industrial fields and enhance general living standarts. For example, comparing superior and poor countries, the amount of money people gain is not hindrance to develop economy and being one of the the most affluent countries. \n On the other hand, one of the policies what makes nations great is restraining people's salaries that is adopted by some countries. They strive to obstruct citizens to get high wages,as a result of this, people do not squander more money redundant things and governments are not forced to have more obligation. For me, taxing authorities could assert their power to impose high tax on unnecessary things and conduct campaign that people allocate their money in sensible way, rather than intruding their salaries. Greece had to experience crisis in last decade which was arised from people's high salaries but the main reason is not high salaries, is people get more money than they deserved. \n To conclude, while citizens who get high wages are one of the main reason behind being strong nation, unconscious payments to people also could lead to being undebted country. Government do not think how they can prevent people from excessive salaries, they have to assume role to avoid problems related-wasting money issues.","the way I teach my students to write these essays is to have them avoid writing a comprehensive personal explanation of their opinion at the end of the prompt paraphrase. That is because the prompt paraphrase should never be more than an explanation of your understanding of the following: \n 1. The topic for the discussion \n 2. The reason for the discussion \n 3. The instructions for the discussion \n While some teachers will say that you should not indicate a repeat of the instructions in the opening paraphrase because is looks like a ""memorized phrase"", in actuality, the examiner expects you to render an explanation of the prompt discussion instruction as part of the English comprehension considerations for the test. It only becomes a memorized phrase because students tend to use the same explanation for the instructions discussion instead of using more complex forms of sentence discussions for it. If you cannot explain what you are supposed to write about, how can the examiner be sure that you will be properly responding to the prompt right? It's all part of the task accuracy test. \n Also, the instructions for the essay, indicates a 5 paragraph response since the maximum explanatory body of paragraphs requires a maximum 3 paragraph presentations of no less than 3 sentences and no more than 5 sentences. You are not supposed to offer a personal opinion at the end of every paragraph. You are supposed to present a solid analytical personal paragraph presentation towards the end of the essay. That is why this essay type requires the 5 paragraph format. \n Your essay suffers from GRA issues. You have several punctuation problems where you use a comma instead of a period which cause confusion when reading the essay. You also have missing subjects in a few presentations that depict actions but not the subject being discussed so the reader is left wondering about what you are trying to say. \n Basically, this is a good start for a practice test. There is room for improvement and I do not doubt that I can guide you well into becoming a successful exam taker provided to continue to diligently practice, listen to the advice given, and apply it to your work for continued improvement.","Your essay addresses a complex and relevant topic, which is whether people should be paid excessive wages and the implications for a country's economy and social structure. Let's explore ways to refine and enhance your writing for clarity, coherence, and effectiveness.

**1- Essay Response to the Topic:**
You've understood the topic but could improve how you introduce it. Start by explaining the discussion topic, its importance, and what the essay will cover, without sharing your opinion just yet. This will help set a clear foundation for your arguments.

**2- Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
There are areas where the punctuation, particularly the use of commas and periods, needs attention to avoid confusion. For example, knowing when to end a sentence and start a new one will greatly improve the readability of your essay. Additionally, watch out for sentences that lack a clear subject, which can leave readers guessing what you are referring to. To address spelling and grammar more effectively, consider using tools like spell check, and read your essay out loud to catch awkward phrases.

**3- Clarity of Point of View:**
Your position on the topic seems to be that high wages can benefit countries economically and socially, despite some drawbacks. To make your viewpoint clearer, try stating your main argument at the beginning of your essay and then reiterating it in the conclusion, ensuring it is supported throughout by your analysis.

**4- Arguments and Descriptive Supports:**
Your essay presents arguments on both sides of the wage issue but could benefit from more specific examples and clearer, more logical explanations. When discussing the benefits of high salaries, for instance, provide concrete examples or data to illustrate your points. Similarly, when arguing against excessive wages, detail the specific problems they can cause, using examples or hypothetical scenarios.

**Structural Suggestions:**
Consider adopting a five-paragraph format, with an introduction, three body paragraphs each focusing on a distinct argument, and a conclusion. This structure helps organize your thoughts and makes your essay easier to follow. Ensure that each body paragraph contains between three to five sentences, clearly presenting a single idea without mixing personal opinions throughout.

**In Summary:**
Your essay is a good starting point, and with focused revision, it can become more coherent and engaging. Paying attention to the structure, providing clear examples, and refining your grammar and punctuation will make your arguments more compelling. Continuously practicing and applying feedback like this will greatly enhance your writing skills.",3,4,3,4,4,3,2,3,4,1,Argumentative
4349,https://essayforum.com/writing/presentation-skills-think-public-75449/,test,IELTS Writing Task 2: Presentation skills. Do you think public speaking skill is really important?,"It has been observed that few people face difficulties to deliver a speech or to give a demo in public. In my view, it is very much essential to master the qualities of oration. This is because enhancing these skills provide a great deal of confidence to an individual. \n To begin with, there are plenty of reasons to illustrate the benefits of giving a presentation in public. First and foremost, individuals who can face the world without shy and hindrance are good at handling things with confidence. In other words, people who can clearly express their ideas and make others understand are bound to achieve success. A good illustration is the life history of Dr. Mukesh Batra, who is the founder of Dr. Batra's Group of Medicine. He started off his journey into the field of medicine and brought his company to the international level in a couple of 20 years. In his biography people have shared his qualities of leadership which were the key to his great success, this reveals that having a quality of addressing audience can act as the key to success. \n In addition, university education includes pursuing internship and projects in the final year of the course. As a part of this, students are supposed to prepare a presentation to brief their project work in front of lecturers and students. Even though, a student has prepared an excellent presentation, without proper narration skills it is indeed difficult to get a higher band. Universities are giving a lot of stress on these skills and some universities are arranging weekend classes on soft skills which are highly beneficial for students. Thus presentation skills give more exposure for Juveniles and help them to express their ideas clearly. \n All in all, communication skill is one of the main soft skills which add flavors to one's professional career. People pursuing these skills are in high demand, who can be appraised and appreciated with some perks.","Dear student, the example that you gave about the doctor is irrelevant to the discussion. You presented his success but it does not clearly related to an ability to be able to conduct public speaking. Public speaking is different from merely speaking to people in private. Public speaking requires an audience and simply talking to people can be done in private. The second paragraph that you wrote about students having to speak in public is also not relevant enough. Had you said that public speaking skills are important when a college student is defending his thesis in front of the thesis board, then the requirement for public speaking skills would have been more relevant. Based on the aforementioned problems of your essay, I do not think that you can score higher than a 4 in the actual test.","Your essay delves into the importance of mastering public speaking and communication skills, which is a commendable subject to discuss, especially considering its relevance in professional and academic settings. Your initial stance on the necessity of oratory skills for individual confidence and success sets a clear direction for the essay. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from refinement and further development to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of your argument.

1. **Relevance to Topic**: 
While you've chosen a relevant topic, the examples and scenarios you've provided need to be more tightly connected to public speaking in formal settings. For instance, the mention of Dr. Mukesh Batra’s success story, although inspirational, doesn't explicitly tie his achievements to his public speaking skills. A more effective example would be to illustrate a situation where public speaking directly contributed to someone's success, such as a business leader influencing stakeholders during a significant public presentation.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: 
Your essay is largely well-written but could benefit from minor grammar and style improvements for clarity and flow. For instance, consider varying sentence structures to create more engaging and dynamic prose. Remember to keep an eye on punctuation and the use of conjunctions to ensure sentences are correctly constructed.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**:
Your viewpoint on the importance of public speaking skills is clear. Nevertheless, it would strengthen your essay to explicitly differentiate between public speaking and other forms of communication, emphasizing why skills in the former are particularly crucial in both educational and professional spheres.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
Your essay's arguments would gain more depth by incorporating examples that directly link public speaking skills to specific outcomes or success stories in a more relevant context. For example, replacing or supplementing the existing examples with one that highlights the significance of these skills during academic defenses (e.g., thesis defense) could make your point much stronger. This adjustment ensures your examples are directly relevant to the importance of public speaking skills.

By addressing these areas—ensuring examples are directly relevant, refining your writing for clarity, and elaborating on the distinction and significance of public speaking—you can significantly enhance your essay. The goal is to provide clear, compelling arguments that convincingly support your stance on the vital role of public speaking skills in nurturing confidence and fostering success.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

However, some people remain skeptical about the possibility and practical benefits of arranging adequate university institutions for the use of numerous students. In my perspective, I strongly disagree with that idea and will discuss all reasons in this essay. \n To begin with, it is practical to provide almost all young adults with access to tertiary education. It is sensible that some people believe that the more educational institutes built, the more financial burden will be put on citizens. However, this problem could be tackled by properly and economically locating schools. For example, in Vietnam, instead of gathering all universities in some big cities, the Vietnamese government has encouraged several schools to implement their branches in some smaller cities. Thanks to this, the number of students attending these local educational places has increased noticeably. This also reduces financial burden on learners since they are able to cut expenditure on renting accommodation, food, and utilities. \n Looking on the other side of the problem, the idea that the availability of universities is unhelpful is completely disagreed because of the fact that formal qualifications have a vital role in the future of young people. Therefore, if a student opts for pursuing tertiary education, he will be likelier to not only have opportunities to broaden his theoretical knowledge but also expand his social network and acquire practical skills by participating in extracurricular activities. This will be in his favour and differentiate him from other peers who choose to opt out higher education when both being considered by employers. \n In conclusion, perceiving that giving access to higher education for a large number of young adults is not entirely impossible or worthless for two major reasons which are the sensible of schools' locations and the significance of pursuing university to students, I strongly believe that people should pay attention to this matter more carefully.","You did not need to include irrelevant information in the opening paraphrase. Use only the information located in the original prompt to retain the essence and subjectivity of the original presentation. To extend the response to the 5 sentence maximum, outline your 2 discussion topics after you present your extent opinion in the paragraph. That will help you score better because you will prove your ability to properly restate the prompt and also, outline your discussion points in a manner that helps the reader understand the flow of the presentation (cohesiveness). \n In paragraph 2, you should have stopped after the justification of how the increased number of schools in smaller cities has helped increase student attendance. The topic of food, utilities and rent was not developed and as such, created a problem in the presentation. You were not able to justify that evidence presentation. So the paragraph became under developed and under explained. Without that extra topic, the paragraph was fully developed. \n As for the 3rd paragraph, you should not have said that you are looking at the other side of the problem because you were still focused on the same evidentiary discussion. That of proving your point of view to be correct. That opening presentation in the 3rd paragraph threw the presentation off and would have affected the C&C score of your essay. To say you are looking at the other side of the problem means you will be presenting a opposing point of view discussion, which isn't what you did in that paragraph. \n Good job on creating a concluding summary. Bad job in the discussion presentation. Do not use a run-on sentence. You need to present it in individualized sentences with one topic per sentence. You still need to meet the 3-5 sentence requirement for that paragraph.","Your essay addresses the topic of the importance and feasibility of providing higher education to a large number of students. The choice to focus on the practicality of expanding educational institutions and the benefits of higher education is relevant and supportive of your overall argument. However, there are some areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Firstly, the introduction could be more concise and directly related to the topic. Instead of including information that doesn't directly respond to the essay prompt, focus on succinctly stating your main argument and briefly outlining the points you will discuss. This approach helps in retaining the reader's attention and sets a clear roadmap for your essay.

In the second paragraph, while the example of Vietnam and the strategy of decentralizing universities to relieve financial burdens is pertinent, the extension into the costs of living like food, utilities, and rent diverges from the main argument and isn't fully explored. It's crucial to ensure that each point you introduce is fully developed and directly related to your central claim to maintain the focus and depth of your essay.

Moreover, the third paragraph's introduction suggests a shift in perspective that doesn't actually occur. Your intention to continue supporting your viewpoint is clear, but signaling a change in argument where none exists can confuse the reader. It's important to maintain consistency in your argumentative stance throughout the essay to enhance cohesion and coherence.

Your conclusion does well to summarize the key points of your argument, but it could be strengthened by a more structured presentation. Instead of consolidating your argument in a single run-on sentence, break down your conclusion into a few concise sentences. This not only meets the sentence requirement but also makes your conclusion clearer and more impactful.

Overall, your essay presents interesting ideas and supports them with examples. Focusing on structuring your essay more effectively, avoiding irrelevant details, and fully developing your arguments will significantly improve the clarity and persuasiveness of your writing. Keep aiming to clearly communicate your ideas and ensure each part of your essay contributes directly to your central thesis for a more cohesive and compelling argument.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

These employees can live in the community then don't need to take many time in traffic. And population which attract by factory will promote more consumption to this community. Therefore the community will become more prosperity. \n However,industrial population which made by factory will make many problem. For example, the smell of air pollution may not just feel disgust but make people hard to breath. Water pollution will contaminate environment. Noisy would bother people who live close to it. And it is hard to know that which problem wouldn't happen before the factory builds. \n In conclusion, I think the living quality is more important than those benefits. More serious, it may hurt our health. We don't need to take the risk and make money. It doesn't worth it. So I think the factory is not good for building near the community.","You must avoid starting your sentences with the connecting words ""And, but, or because"". As these are connecting words, these are normally used in the middle of a sentence for the purpose of connecting 2 related thoughts. These are the ""cohesive"" words that bind what would otherwise be 2 separate sentences of a connected thought into one presentation sentence. That is why these words cannot be used as opening sentence words. Your paragraph discussions need work. There is a lack of clarity in your presentation which affected its coherence. This was caused by your lack of English sentence structure development skill. Which, I believe, was caused by your lack of English vocabulary. I strongly suggest that you brush up on your English reading so that you will become more familiar with the way English sentences are structured and how certain words are used in their sentence presentation. While you did provide a somewhat understandable presentation in this essay, you are still a long way from being prepared to take the TOEFL test.

You have identified both the positive and negative impacts this can have on a community, which is excellent for creating a balanced argument. However, there are several areas where you could improve your essay to make your arguments clearer and your writing more effective.

Firstly, it's important to address the essay topic directly and ensure that all parts of your essay contribute to your viewpoint. While you mention the pros and cons of building a factory, it would strengthen your essay to directly link these back to your main opinion more clearly throughout the essay, not just at the beginning and end.

In terms of spelling, grammar, and style, you've made a good effort, but there are some issues that need addressing. Avoid starting sentences with coordinating conjunctions like ""And,"" ""But,"" or ""Or."" These words are better suited to joining ideas within a sentence rather than starting a new sentence. This will help your writing to sound more polished and professional. 

You might also benefit from working on sentence structure and the variety of vocabulary used in your essay. At times, the way sentences are constructed or the repetitive use of certain words can make your arguments less clear and engaging. Brushing up on reading in English can be incredibly helpful in familiarizing yourself with sentence construction and vocabulary usage. 

Regarding coherence and clarity, try to organize your paragraphs around one main idea each. This helps the reader follow your argument more easily. In your current essay, thoughts sometimes seem disconnected, which can confuse readers. To avoid this, introduce your main idea at the beginning of a paragraph, then use the rest of the paragraph to support it with detailed examples and arguments.

Lastly, your conclusion successfully restates your main viewpoint, which is good. However, extending this a bit more to reflect on the arguments presented or suggesting a potential solution or compromise could make your conclusion stronger.

In summary, your essay has a solid foundation, but focusing on sentence structure, avoiding starting sentences with conjunctions, enhancing your vocabulary, and ensuring clarity in your argumentation will make your writing more effective. Continue practicing and engaging with English reading materials, and consider writing practice essays to apply these tips. This will not only prepare you better for English proficiency tests but also enhance your overall communication skills in English.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

Studying the past does not only help people realize and avoid worthless failures but also points out key factors to success. For instance, society would continue making harmful economic decisions unless they learn from the causes of global recessions the world had faced. Meanwhile, directly trying to face problems is also considered a possible solution and in this case, historical knowledge has little to tell humans. Nevertheless, this would be much more time-consuming as people could have to retry many times in comparison to drawing experience from similar situations in the past. \n In conclusion, while it is a popular belief that history has little influence on modern people, many would consider its significant contributions to the understanding of the present.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of your argument. Let's go through some specific feedback points:

1. **Topic Response and Clarity**:
   - Your opening statement suggests a misunderstanding of the essay prompt. You mention a ""colossal issue"" regarding learning about the past, which doesn’t accurately represent the discussion about differing opinions on its value. It's essential to directly address the question being asked, focusing on why history might be considered important or not to the understanding of the present, rather than framing it as a large problem.
   - In your introduction, you state you will discuss both views and the importance of history, which somewhat diverges from the prompt's requirements. A stronger thesis would make a clear claim about either the significance or irrelevance of history in understanding the present, backing it up with personal reasoning.
   
2. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**:
   - Your essay demonstrates a good attempt at using complex phrases and vocabulary. However, ensure that these phrases are used appropriately. Misusing sophisticated language or phrases can confuse your message rather than clarify it. For instance, ensure the context fits the use of phrases such as ""without a doubt"" which may not align with the nuance of the discussion where opinions are divided.
   - There are no significant spelling mistakes noticed, which is good. However, pay close attention to maintaining proper verb tenses and agreement throughout your essay to boost its readability and professionalism.
   
3. **Point of View Clarity**:
   - Your essay tends to summarize the importance of history from a general perspective rather than emphasizing your personal viewpoint. Remember, your perspective should guide the essay, informed by the arguments of others but ultimately rooted in your own analysis and reasoning.

4. **Supporting Arguments**:
   - While you provide examples to support the relevance of historical knowledge, the essay could be strengthened by more directly counteracting the viewpoint that history is irrelevant to modern times. This involves not just stating that history provides lessons and experiences but explaining why these are invaluable compared to a focus solely on contemporary issues.
   - Make sure to distinguish between general benefits of historical knowledge and specific arguments that directly address the prompt's focus. Your examples about economic decisions and innovations are a step in the right direction but remember to explicitly connect them back to how they support your overarching claim about the value of historical understanding in the present.

In conclusion, your essay has a solid foundation with a clear intent to discuss the value of learning about the past. To improve, focus on directly answering the prompt with a clear thesis, using appropriate language, and enhancing your argument with specific, related examples. Incorporating a personal perspective that is grounded in the discussion and ensuring your points are tightly aligned with the essay's requirements will significantly boost the effectiveness of your writing.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

There is, indeed, an enormous number of benefits hosting an international event involving sports can bring for a country. Nevertheless, everything comes with a price, and for many countries, responsibilities like this can prove to be a heavy burden. \n Admittedly, having the honor to host a global sports event means various financial and political advantages for a country. First, the hosting country will attract more international investment even many years to come after the event. In detail, Its image can be abundantly raised and may even take the top spot in the local region as a promising country, consequently granting itself more investment. Second, other countries will seek to establish a companionship with the hosting country, thus giving its government more power and influence among the world leaders. A country with a respected position and others' support undoubtedly has every opportunity for consistent and rapid development. \n However, hosting an event as such may be destructive to the country's economy. It is the extortionate cost and impracticality of organizing such an event that makes the idea a terrible one. In other words, the financial burden the country has to bear and what to do with the facilities invested after the end of the event can be a big issue for the country. Taking Brazil, for example, years after the world cup and the building of the grand Rio de Janeiro stadium, it is still trying to make up for all the money wasted in facilities and find a way to make use of the billion-dollar stadium, with its maintenance fees most likely being too high to retain and the current conditions of which too low to be up for rent. \n All in all, though the chance to host a global sports event would bring lots of great benefits for the country, it is most advisable for countries without adequate financial background to forfeit any responsibility of hosting such events.","In the first paragraph, you were able to address the topic restatement covering the 2 points of view in the first sentence. It was the discussion instruction part that you were not able to properly represent as: \n <em>Due to these varying opinions, I will have to carefully consider both sides of the discussion and offer an idea as to why I support or do not support the stated point of view.</em> \n Or \n Based on these reasons, I find that I support the opinion that____________ mainly because (state your reason). \n Either format will work for the restatement because both offers a clear take on how you will be discussing the topics and how you intend to present your point of view in the discussion paragraphs. \n You have to remember that for each point of view, you need to present the public opinion before you state your personal opinion. Usually, the reasons for the public opinion are provided in the original prompt. If not, then you should find a reason to support the public opinion. Explain the public point of view because the prompt says ""some people"" and ""while others"". This means that you have to use some public presentation first before you present your opinion. Your opinion should always be based on the public opinion explanation that you have provided. What you did here was set the essay up as a personal point of view presentation, rather than a public comparison discussion with a personal point of view. The latter is, the more appropriate approach to the discussion since you are scored on the clarity of your opinion. Once you establish how your opinion is based on the public explanation, your C&C score will be increased. \n As for your LR problems, the only way you can improve your vocabulary is to read more English works. There are many opinion columns being written in free to access online newspapers from the USA and the UK. If you can read more opinion columns, not only will your approach to essay writing improve, but you will also be able to improve your vocabulary by taking note of words you do not understand then looking up the word meaning in the dictionary, while also learning alternative references by learning the synonym words for it. All of these, as a learning process, can help you improve your LR and GRA scores.","This essay thoughtfully addresses the issue of hosting international sports events, presenting both the positive and negative implications for the hosting country. To enhance your essay and make your argument more compelling, consider the following feedback.

1. **Topic Response:**
You've done well to introduce both perspectives on the topic, which lays a solid foundation for your essay. However, to further improve, explicitly state your personal stance on the issue early in your essay. This can be done by stating something like, ""Considering these perspectives, my view is that..."" followed by a brief explanation of your position. This will not only clarify your viewpoint but also guide the reader through your subsequent arguments.

2. **Clarity and Structure:**
Your essay would benefit significantly from a more structured approach to presenting public opinion before introducing your own viewpoint. While you've effectively outlined the advantages and disadvantages, explicitly connecting your personal perspective to these broader views will strengthen your argument. Begin with summarizing public opinions as they relate to the topic, and then clearly distinguish your personal viewpoint, grounding it in the reasons discussed. This method will help increase the coherence and clarity of your essay.

3. **Language and Style:**
You demonstrate a good command of language, but there's always room for improvement. To enhance your vocabulary and linguistic range, regularly reading English texts, particularly opinion columns from respected publications, is highly recommended. This practice will expose you to varied sentence structures and new vocabulary. When encountering unfamiliar words, look up their meanings and synonyms. This approach will not only enrich your vocabulary but also sharpen your argumentation skills, making your essays more persuasive.

4. **Grammar and Spelling:**
Your essay has minor spelling and grammatical errors. Paying close attention to these details can significantly improve the overall quality of your writing. For example, in ""Its image can be abundantly raised,"" ""Its"" should be lowercase unless starting a sentence. Regular practice, along with careful proofreading, can help minimize these errors.

5. **Supporting Arguments:**
Your arguments are well-presented, with clear examples like the situation in Brazil. To further strengthen your essay, ensure each point is detailed and directly supports your overall stance. Whenever possible, also consider adding statistics or studies to back up your claims, as this adds credibility to your arguments.

In conclusion, your essay effectively addresses the topic, offering both sides of the argument concerning hosting international sports events. By clearly stating your position, enhancing your essay's structure, expanding your vocabulary, and refining your grammar, you can elevate your writing. Continued practice, along with an emphasis on reading a wide range of English texts, will significantly aid in your improvement.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

From my perspective, living far away from home is the optimal choice because students will have the chance to learn how to live in this world independently and make more rooms for new relationships. \n In the past, many parents protected their children from the negative influence and assisted them with all the chores in the house, so that students living at home may completely concentrate on their academic study. Besides, having a chance to live on their own, these students will become more independent because they have to calculate precisely for anything that involves money, think carefully before making important decisions, and take responsibility for their health, career, and relationships. From my personal experience, if you thought that you had prepared for obstacles or frauds, you would be extremely disappointed after being fooled countless times. For example, many of my friends who had chosen to live in the dormitory or rented a boarding house, after a few years, they turned out to be reliable and self-reliant. \n Getting to the door of the college, you would have left most of your old friends behind since each person had their dreams and passions. If I were you, I would not be devastated because you will have the opportunities to make new relationships. In some colleges such as business schools, they will encourage you to enroll in some company that fits your major to earn experiences and accumulate relationships like potential-clients and partners. \n Based on articles and stories about successful people, they all have in commons that is becoming independent from the early days and have remarkable communication skills. In conclusion, it is in my belief that college students should live away from home, for the reasons provided above.","Try to respond directly to the question being asked before you give your opinion. Do you agree or disagree? \n <em>I agree that undergraduate students will benefit from living away from their parents. That is because (state your 2 reasons).</em> \n Always be precise in your response because your TA score depends on it. Always format the rephrased section using the 3-5 sentence format for optimal scoring potential in that section. \n You are not providing a discussion of a specific reason in your second paragraph. You are only outlining your discussion topics. That is not the same as developing your paragraph ideas and explanations. Use only 1 topic per paragraph and fully explain your support for that idea through personal opinion, examples, and supporting evidence within the discussion paragraph. Using your personal experience will help you score better as you will be using explanations that you can strongly support and clearly present to the reader. \n The conclusion is also incorrect. Please provide a summary of the topic and reasons you discussed, along with a restatement of your response to the question. The concluding paragraph is used as a discussion reminder only. It should not be an open discussion presentation because that leaves you with an open ended presentation rather than a concluded discussion.","Your essay on whether students benefit more from living away from home during their college years presents some compelling arguments. However, there are several areas where improvements could elevate your essay significantly.

1. **Addressing the Topic Prompt:**
Firstly, it's crucial to directly address the question posed in the topic promptly. While your perspective is clear, explicitly stating whether you agree or disagree at the beginning can clarify your position. For example, you could start by saying, ""I firmly believe that living away from home provides undergraduate students with invaluable life lessons and skills."" This not only answers the question directly but also sets the stage for the arguments you'll present.

2. **Clarity and Development of Ideas:**
Each paragraph should focus on a specific reason supporting your view, fully elaborated with personal opinions, examples, and evidence. Rather than outlining topics broadly, dive deeper into each point with detailed explanations. For instance, when discussing independence, share a personal anecdote demonstrating how living away from home fostered self-reliance and problem-solving skills. This approach will make your arguments more persuasive and grounded.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
While your essay is relatively clear, paying close attention to spelling and grammar will enhance its readability and professionalism. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged and to better emphasize key points. Avoid overly complex sentences, as simplicity often leads to clearer communication, especially for English language learners.

4. **Concluding the Essay:**
The conclusion should succinctly summarize the arguments discussed and restate your stance on the topic, offering a definitive end to the discussion. Instead of introducing new ideas or leaving the discussion open, reinforce what you've already mentioned. A stronger conclusion might be, ""In light of the evidence and personal experiences discussed, it is clear that living away from home equips college students with crucial skills and experiences, underscoring my belief in its benefits.""

By directly addressing the prompt, developing your ideas with clear and specific examples, and concluding your discussion effectively, you can make your essay more coherent and persuasive.

These customs and traditions are naturally handed down to be preserved. To me, they are symbolic evidence of human society. \n Nowadays, with emerging new technology, people see that these traditions are not necessary to be preserved. Regarding the development pace of human society, while the traditional culture is generally too slow, the new technology is significantly too fast. To catch up with the change, people spend more time and energy on improving our society. On the other hand, some traditional customs can simply be completed through the internet in order to save more time. We benefit from these technologies and innovations to make our life better than ever. \n However, we cannot forget the root where these traditional cultures come from. We should know that these traditions are originally from us the human beings. These customs are again built by the robust connections of societies. Even with such new social platforms (a.k.a. new technology) like WhatApps and FaceBook, the relationship between person to person cannot bring us together closer than in the past. We learn these cultures from history and create new things based on them too. \n Although the new technology has been bringing us a more convenient life, we should not ignore the traditional cultures. Remember that all things come from history, and these customs, traditions, and cultures are the history left to us. I believe preserving them is the only way to create a better life.","The most glaring error in this task presentation is the first paragraph. The simple prompt restatement (2 sentences for 2 opinions) + personal opinion (one sentence) is not represented in the format required. The writer made the mistake of immediately discussing his personal opinion in this paragraph so this preliminary scoring aspect will definitely receive a failing score. This error alone is enough to fail the total essay, regardless of how well developed the next paragraphs are. The writer has shown a lack of understanding of the task requirements and the requirement for the presentation. \n The total essay is based on the writer's opinion of the 2 points of view alone. The examiner is looking for the explanation / discussion of the validity of each public opinion based upon proper pronoun usage. So the reasoning paragraphs will be scored, but the overall essay will be considered under develeoped due to the improper discussion development, based on the multiple point of view format. Again, the essay will not receive passing marks based on this presentation. \n The concluding summary is non-existent in this essay. Rather than a summarized discussion presentation, the writer continued to discuss reasons in the last paragraph. Which means, the essay does not have a chance of getting a passing score due to improper discussion presentations, missing references, and an inaccurate summary presentation.","Your essay on the importance of traditional cultures amidst the rise of new technologies presents an engaging argument and demonstrates a clear personal conviction. However, there are several areas in need of improvement to meet the expected standards for this type of essay.

Firstly, the essay's introduction does not effectively set up the essay structure. Normally, an introduction briefly outlines differing viewpoints before stating the author's own perspective. Incorporating an introduction that clearly delineates between general opinions and your personal stance would strengthen the foundation of your essay.

In terms of content, the essay predominantly reflects personal opinions without a balanced discussion of various viewpoints. For the essay to be more compelling, it's vital to objectively present and explore different perspectives before arguing for your position. This approach not only demonstrates critical thinking but also adheres to the task requirements which expect an examination of various public opinions. 

Concerning the essay's organization, it lacks a conclusive paragraph. A strong conclusion summarizes the key points discussed and reiterates the author's stance, providing clear closure to the essay. Instead, the essay ends with further argumentation, missing the opportunity to succinctly tie together the discussed ideas. Introducing a concluding summary would significantly enhance the cohesiveness and effectiveness of your argument.

On a stylistic note, the essay would benefit from a more varied sentence structure and precise vocabulary to convey your points more powerfully. While the message is clear, diversifying your sentence construction and word choice could enhance clarity and engagement.

Lastly, the essay has a few spelling and grammatical errors. Paying careful attention to proofreading would improve the essay's professionalism and readability. It's also important to accurately use technology-related terms (e.g., WhatsApp instead of WhatApps).

In summary, consider reorganizing your essay to include a clear introduction, a balanced discussion of different perspectives, and a conclusive summary. Additionally, focus on refining your style and grammar for a more polished and compelling argument.

4356,https://essayforum.com/writing/question-people-restrict-video-games-94167/,test,The essay about the question: Should people restrict video games?,"As musician Ezra Koenig said, ""Some people say video games rot your brain, but I think they work different muscles that maybe you don't normally use."" Practically, many people believe that there should be restrictions on computer games due to their negative impacts on human mental health. However, the idea of setting boundaries for video games has been the main cause of many disputes between children and their parents or schools. In fact, electronic games are thought to be an educational program for the young generation, which would be an appropriate channel prompting innovative ideas rather than mental degradation. \n Initially, in this digital era, video games have grown as an academic training program for many families and schools. To elaborate, various Vietnamese primary schools and high schools developed projects which applied both literal and logical subjects in computer games to help students attain in-class lessons effectively and efficiently. Additionally, families can easily encourage their children to be innovative via some virtual models or characteristics in those. Therefore, children may find their interest in study and grasp their job opportunity because a massive number of IT engineers state that one of their inspirations for the current job is video games. \n On the opposite side, computer games are also considered as one of the reasons for family conflict and school bullying. Particularly, many arguments between children and their parents have been more serious due to the gaming disorder. Furthermore, schools are also struggling to solve many cyberbullying cases resulting from the brutal aspects of video games. To explain, video games have become a problematic and compulsive program due to some violent and murdering scenes that may deteriorate the mental health of especially the young generation. Literally, if parents or schools have chosen ethical and educational video games instead of implementing strict rules at home and delivering a stressful theoretical curriculum at school, children will be aware of the drawbacks of computer games. Thus, their mind may not be manipulated with hard requirements and hefty knowledge both from family and school. \n In conclusion, even though some people reckon that video games are barriers for children's mental development, they are actually one of the primary tools which can help children be more creative, knowledgeable, and pursue their dream job in not only the field of technology but also many other areas.","While the examiner will appreciate the quotation at the start of the essay, he cannot consider it as a part of the preliminary or overall scoring process. That is because such quotes, specially when placed at the start of the prompt restatement, will definitely alter the discussion. Additionally, it is obvious to me that you did research online to find that relevant quote. In reality, you will not have internet access during the exam so you should not fall into the habit of doing research during the practice test. Use your own opinions, ideas, and examples as much as possible. When applicable, use publicly known knowledge, which you knew about beforehand. \n The actual prompt restatement cannot really be traced in the paraphrasing + writer's opinion because the original topic was not restated in an effective manner and the writer's response was not clearly marked by the use of 1st person pronouns. It is almost as if the writer is completing a general research paper rather than a task 2 essay. The first paragraph does not fall into the task 2 writing format for the question. \n When I compare the question that the student provided to his response, I can only conclude that the response is not related to the question posed. He never really answered if video games should be restricted. Instead, he did a comparative discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of computer games. If that was the question provided, then the response would be correct. However, the question has to do with access to video games, this could refer to play time or the types of games played. Neither of the possible topics for discussion, in relation to the prompt were used in the presentation. So the essay is not prompt adherent. Since it does not answer the question properly, nor does it restate the prompt in a related manner, I doubt that this essay can receive a passing score. \n I cannot even review the other scoring sections of this presentation at this point. Not when the content is the main problem of the discussion presentation. If the writer had provided the original prompt, I might have been able to present a better assessment of this writing task in relation to his response. As far as I am concerned, the title topic and the discussion provided are not related in the correct manner.","The essay begins with an engaging quote from musician Ezra Koenig, which aims to set the tone for the discussion on video games. While using quotes can make essays interesting, it's important to also focus on presenting your own opinions and ideas, particularly in test situations where you won't have access to external sources for research. In English proficiency exams, assessors value original thoughts and the ability to express them clearly and directly. 

One crucial aspect that needs improvement is ensuring the essay directly answers the question posed. The essay discusses the benefits and drawbacks of video games, which is related but does not directly address the topic of whether there should be restrictions on computer games due to their impact on mental health. For a stronger response, it's vital to clearly restate the question in your own words and make your stance evident, preferably in the introduction. Using the first person to present your opinions (""I believe,"" ""From my perspective,"" etc.) can help make your point of view clearer to the reader.

Regarding the structure and content, while the essay presents arguments for both sides, it loses focus by not adhering to the specific question asked about restrictions on video games. For future essays, concentrate on answering the question directly. If the question asks whether video games should be restricted, your essay should focus specifically on arguments related to that topic, including potential benefits of restrictions and possible drawbacks.

The essay does well in trying to balance both sides of the argument, mentioning how video games can be both educational and a cause for concern regarding mental health and social issues like family conflicts and bullying. However, for each point made, it's beneficial to provide clear, real-life examples and explain how these support your overall argument. 

In terms of language, the essay is generally well-written, but attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and style can always be improved. Watch out for overly complex sentences or ideas that could be simplified for clarity. Ensuring your writing is accessible and easy to understand will strengthen your argument and make it more persuasive.

Lastly, it's commendable that the conclusion attempts to bring together the essay's main points, reaffirming the position that video games can be a valuable tool rather than just a hindrance. Remember, the conclusion should also reflect back on the original question, summarizing how your arguments have supported your stance on the issue.

In summary, focusing on directly answering the question, clearly stating your opinion, structuring your essay to address the prompt, and refining language use are all areas that can improve the effectiveness of your essay.

One way that many teachers prefer to do is to ask students to work together in their project. However, in my opinion working together for projects causes several problems. First, the learning process needs personal experiences which might not happen in a group project and second, it might results in conflict, eventually. \n To begin with, learning effectively has different steps which one of them is working in groups. However, when students are in its initial step, working together is much of a problem than the answer. Consider as an example that two students want to make a woody bicycle, none of them have enough experience working with wood which results in not finishing the job. \n On the other hand, if one of them has enough experience and others lack such experiences, the end result would be a division between group members. This happens because the student with more experience cannot stand others to made mistake and he or she wants to be the dominant person which this behavior disturbs the other members. Finally, it will either end up in a conflict or a situation where the experienced student should finish the job because others are reluctant to participate. These outcomes are completely opposite of the intended goals. \n Nevertheless, there are some points in working together that helps children in the future.

It is an alteration because it does not provide insight in the manner that is dictated by the original prompt. Since this essay does not properly address the TA requirements, your score will be a low 2 because it barely responds to the task. Your opening statement is not even a representation of the TA requirements as it does not paraphrase the original presentation that was provided to you.

If one is asked to ""discuss both opinions"", then you can do a comparative discussion of the two sides.","The essay explores the topic of group work in educational settings, offering a clear stance against it. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and alignment with the essay prompt.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay begins with an introduction to the debate on teaching methods, specifically focusing on group projects. However, it appears there's a misunderstanding of the task. The prompt calls for a clear agree or disagree stance, supported by reasons and examples. Instead, the essay ventures into discussing both benefits and drawbacks of group work, which deviates from the required format. To improve, focus strictly on arguing against group work, as indicated, without delving into its potential benefits unless directly refuting them as part of your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few areas where grammar and spelling could be enhanced. For example, ""it might results in conflict"" should be ""it might result in conflict."" Paying attention to verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement will greatly improve the readability of the essay. Additionally, simplifying complex sentences and ensuring clear subject pronouns can help with stylistic clarity.

3. **Author’s Point of View**: The viewpoint against group projects is explicit, which is a strength of the essay. However, this perspective could be strengthened with a clearer introduction that aligns directly with the essay's instructions. For example, directly stating disagreement with the premise that students should work together on projects would set a clearer context for the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay provides reasons against group work but lacks specific, detailed examples to illustrate these points. For instance, mentioning the project about building a wooden bicycle provides a scenario but doesn’t delve deeply into how this example supports the argument against group work. Incorporating detailed examples, such as a specific outcome of the mentioned conflict or misunderstanding, would make the argument more compelling. Additionally, ensuring that the examples are directly related to the disadvantages of group work will help maintain coherence in the essay.

To improve, it is recommended to:
- Rework the introduction to explicitly state disagreement with group projects, directly addressing the essay prompt.
- Focus on providing detailed examples and elaborations for each point made against group work.
- Review grammar, particularly verb tense and subject-verb agreement.
- Avoid discussing the benefits of group work unless directly refuting them as part of the argument against it.

This is to say, there are chances that a young leader can drive the company out of business with some of his bold, half-baked ideas. \n Another advantage of seniority is the ability to win others' approval, which plays the pivotal role in the success of a leader. Most of the time when an old man raises his voice, people would pay their undivided attention, and this is hardly achievable if the speaker has only a few years of working experience. Young people, on their way to leadership, must dedicate tremendous amounts of energy and time making contributions to prove their worthiness, so that people can trust and give them full support. \n In conclusion, I hold the view that young people should be promoted with consideration. In long run, it is more sensible to hold the aged members in charge of leadership.","Dear student, this is a highly insightful essay that I believe is very much on point to getting at least a 6 overall score. The reason why this essay did not get a 6.6, in my opinion is because you did not appropriately respond to the question given in the original prompt within your paraphrase. You must also respond to the question given using the word choice for response originally given. In this essay, the word choice response is agree or disagree. There is no question about what you believe therefore, you response statement should have been: \n <em>I disagree with the opinion that youthful leaders could be more beneficial to a business due to several factors.</em> \n You need to refer to the original discussion in your thesis paraphrase by using the keyword from the original question. That shows a clear understanding of the given instruction and a degree of analysis provided based on the existing discussion topic. It will be sure to drive your TA score higher. \n Your reasoning paragraphs are sound and logical. Those are very well written and presented paragraphs of the complex nature which are sure to increase the GRA score of your essay along with the C&C requirements. Your LR may also score well since you obviously have a clear understanding of English words, its meaning and how to use it in a sentence. \n One mistake in your essay though, your concluding summary did not really pass the summary presentation. It lacks a presentation of the prompt, your opinion, and your reasons in summary form with an accompanying closing sentence. That is at least 4 sentences in total that could have further increased your TA score.","This essay effectively addresses the topic, presenting a clear standpoint on why senior members are deemed more suitable for leadership roles in organizations rather than young employees. Your argumentative competency and logical structuring are commendable, reflecting a strong grasp of English usage and an ability to express complex ideas coherently, which significantly benefits your essay's readability and persuasive power.

However, there are areas where enhancement can further elevate the quality of your work and potentially your overall score on English proficiency tests. To begin with, it's essential to closely align your response with the specific wording of the prompt's question. The prompt likely asked you to agree or disagree with a given statement, which requires using these precise terms in your thesis statement. A more aligned response might be: ""I disagree with the notion that youthful leaders could be more beneficial to a business due to several factors."" This specificity not only demonstrates your attentiveness to the given instructions but also frames your essay more accurately within the context of the question.

Moreover, while your reasoning paragraphs are logically sound and support your viewpoint well, refining your concluding paragraph could increase the effectiveness of your essay. A strong conclusion summarizes the prompt, restates your stance, outlines your supporting reasons, and closes with a final thought or statement to reinforce your position. This approach ensures a comprehensive recapitulation of your argument, making your essay more cohesive and impactful. Indeed, providing at least four sentences in your conclusion would ensure a more thorough summary presentation, thus potentially improving your score.

To further enhance your essay, pay attention to minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic nuances that can detract from the professional quality of your writing. While your essay is largely free of such errors, maintaining vigilance against them in future writing endeavors is advisable.

Finally, while your perspective on leadership in organizations is clear and well-supported, incorporating contrasting views or counterarguments before refuting them can enrich your argument by showing a broader understanding of the subject. This technique not only demonstrates your ability to engage critically with different viewpoints but also strengthens the persuasiveness of your own position.

In summary, your essay is well-constructed and presents a coherent argument. By fine-tuning your response to directly answer the prompt, providing a more detailed conclusion, and considering the incorporation of counterarguments, you can further improve your essay's effectiveness and potentially achieve a higher proficiency score.",4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

While this breeds considerable benefits, certain resulting problems should be taken into sober consideration. \n One of the greatest contributions of robot to human life is that they enable millions of people to work efficiently and enjoy higher quality of life. In fact, thanks to the capability of robotic devices to handle work and resolve information at incredible speed and with accuracy, the burden of workloads could be substantially lowered, which means that many workers would expedite working process and yield more desirable productivity. At the same time, as household chores including cooking and cleaning are done by robots, many employees would have more time to relax and enjoy healthy home-cooked meals after a hard-working day at workplaces. This helps them to preclude potential diseases related to the lack of relaxation and consumption of unhygienic food including obesity, diabetes and even cancer. \n Notwithstanding all that, i am convinced that there are various risks that human may have to incur as a result of reliance on robotic assistants. From an objective perspective, the completion of domestic chores by robots means that people would take less physical activities and be highly likely to lead a sedentary lifestyle. This is totally a thorny problem in the fast-paced world where millions of them desperately need a healthy and active body to work efficaciously and prevent illnesses. Without being health-conscious and continuing to rely on these futuristic devices, not only do they have to expend more money to pay for the cost of hospitalization but their longevity is also reduced. Moreover, once such state-of-the-art artificial intelligence is able to perform tasks and assignments more effectively than human, chances are that they will be under the threat of being superseded and made redundant. Consequently, unemployment coupled with social maladies would inevitably accelerate and the future of humanity could be threatened. \n In conclusion, although the importance of robots in assisting people with work and household tasks is unimpeachable, i think that people's lives could be dominated as a result of their versatility based on aforementioned arguments.","The flowery word usage does not respond correctly to the question asked.

The writer created a totally disconnected discussion prompt of his own. \n The essay, due to the altered discussion response and format will recieve a failing score based mostly on an unrelated prompt response.","The essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the effects of robotics in modern society. You effectively discussed both the advantages and disadvantages of robotic advancements, showcasing your ability to analyze complex topics. However, to refine your work and enhance its effectiveness, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Adherence to the Essay Prompt:** The primary area that requires improvement is ensuring your response directly answers the question posed by the prompt. The prompt seems to inquire about whether the development being discussed is positive or negative. Instead of providing a definitive stance, your essay debates the pros and cons, which, while informative, strays from directly addressing whether you perceive the development as overall positive or negative. Next time, aim to understand the question's core requirement - in this case, whether to argue the development is good or bad - and structure your argument around this directive.

2. **Clarity and Precision in Language:** While your essay is rich in language and ideas, there's a tendency to use complex or ""flowery"" language that might obscure your message. Direct and clear language can often be more powerful, especially in making sure your point is understood. For example, instead of saying ""the advent of robotic equipment has assisted human in both working and domestic tasks,"" you might consider simplifying it to ""robots help humans with work and household chores."" This directness can also aid in presenting your opinion more clearly, aligning your discussion more closely with the essay prompt.

3. **Grammar and Stylistic Choices:** There are minor grammatical issues, such as the lowercase ""i"" when referring to oneself, which should always be capitalized. Paying attention to these details enhances the professionalism and clarity of your writing. Additionally, be mindful of creating balanced and cohesive arguments. While your essay does a commendable job of discussing both sides of the issue, ensure that your conclusion succinctly ties these points back to your central argument or stance.

4. **Argument Development:** Your essay demonstrates strong potential for developing clear and descriptive arguments. You effectively discussed the benefits and potential drawbacks of robotic advancements. Going forward, reinforce your stance with more specific examples and evidence. If arguing for a particular viewpoint, consider dedicating more space to arguments that support that viewpoint, while also acknowledging counterarguments. This will provide a more persuasive and compelling argument.

In conclusion, your essay sheds light on important considerations regarding the role of robotics in society. With a more direct response to the essay prompt, clearer and simpler language, attention to grammatical detail, and focused argumentation, your writing will undoubtedly become more impactful. Remember, the goal is not only to showcase your ability to analyze complex issues but also to communicate your ideas clearly and persuasively in response to the given task.",4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

However, to improve, it's essential to focus on a few key areas:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay presents a clear position on the topic, which is good. However, the structure of your argument could be improved by following a more organized approach. Essays for English proficiency tests often follow a specific format. A recommended structure is:
   - **Paragraph 1:** Introduce the topic and your thesis or main idea.
   - **Paragraph 2:** Present the first general viewpoint on this issue, not your own, using ""they believe"" or ""some people argue.""
   - **Paragraph 3:** Introduce a second viewpoint different from the first, again not your own.
   - **Paragraph 4:** Share your personal viewpoint and support it with reasons and examples.
   - **Paragraph 5:** Summarize your argument and restate your position clearly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are several areas where spelling and grammar could be improved. For example:
   - ""Some of research data are too valuable to be publish"" should be ""Some of the research data is too valuable to be published.""
   - Be mindful of repetitive words and try to vary your language to enhance readability.
   - Pay attention to punctuation, such as missing periods and misplaced commas.

3. **Author's Point of View:** Your perspective is clear, which is a strength. However, ensuring that your position is supported with well-explained reasons and examples in a dedicated paragraph will make your argument stronger.

4. **Arguments and Supports:** While you provide reasons and examples, they could be more specific and detailed. For each reason supporting your view, include a clear example or data to illustrate your point effectively.

Remember, clarity and structure are just as important as the content of your argument.

While discussing the pros and cons of the consequences it may have. This essay tends towards the point of view that the benefits of this situation outweigh the drawbacks. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that the increasing of young people in the society might embody many serious results. This is because the lack of experience in work and life that young generations have. Young people, especially adolescence, are usually not furnished with enough essential skills to have the adaptability as the senior citizens. Also, the population can be considered as the main factor that causes the proliferation of young-related crimes. A recent study for example, has shown that nearly 80 percent of crimes in the US caused by adolescence since their superficial understanding of the world. Most of them have the appetite for proving themselves. As a result, the whole society may endure the high incidence of crimes, sex, violence and strikes. \n On the other hand, the society in which young generation captures the main rate of population may take some considerable advantages. Initially, most of the young people have their enthusiasm which can lead them to the willingness of embracing new ideas. this is because they are practically open-minded to have foray into challenges in lieu of giving when facing with troubles. In other words, their creativity will pave the way for rejuvenation of pivotal fields in modern technology like economic, science and intellectual properties. \n In conclusion, while it is apparent that population which is almost young adults may have some consequences, it is worthwhile to claim that the young generation are more beneficial than the young ones.","You will not get a passing score in any section of this test.

However, there are several areas that require attention to enhance clarity, accuracy, and overall effectiveness of the argument.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The introduction attempts to set up a discussion on the outcomes of a demographic shift towards a younger population. However, the presentation of the topic is somewhat unclear and fails to precisely restate the original prompt. It's crucial to start with a clear thesis statement that accurately reflects the topic being addressed, ensuring the reader can understand the main argument from the beginning.

2. **Language and Grammar Issues:** The essay contains several spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors that could hinder comprehension. For instance, there's inconsistency in terminology, with terms like ""juvenile"" and ""adolescence"" used ambiguously. These terms generally refer to individuals before adulthood, thus inaccurately representing the essay's focus on young adults. Attention to precise language use and clear definitions of terms will significantly improve the essay's clarity and coherence.

3. **Clarity of Author’s Point of View:** The author's perspective becomes evident through the assertion that the advantages of a youthful population outweigh the disadvantages. However, this viewpoint needs to be stated more clearly and confidently. A thesis statement explicitly outlining this position at the beginning would provide a strong foundation for the arguments that follow.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay provides arguments for both sides of the issue but sometimes lacks depth and specificity. For example, mentioning a ""recent study"" without detailed citation or exploration leaves the argument feeling unsupported. Arguments can be strengthened by providing specific examples, data, or more detailed reasoning to substantiate claims.

5. **Recommendations for Improvement:**
   - Revisit the essay's introduction to ensure it accurately and clearly sets up the topic and the author's stance.
   - Address spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors by proofreading. Consider the precision of your vocabulary to enhance clarity.
   - Make sure the distinctions between different age groups (juveniles, adolescents, young adults) are clear and correctly applied throughout the essay.
   - Strengthen arguments with specific examples, data, and detailed reasoning. Each claim should be followed by evidence that supports it.
   - Work on a clearer, more compelling conclusion that reaffirms the essay's main argument, summarizing the key points made in support of the viewpoint.

By focusing on these areas, the essay can be significantly improved to more effectively communicate its analysis and insights on the impact of a younger demographic predominance.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

To begin with, they are afraid that the land could bring about inevitable evil. In some area, government renovates cemeteries into a range of brilliant blocks in order to attract inhabitants' settlement. Although living in modern society, some individuals affected by ancient beliefs still have a certain failure about ghosts and devils. Additionally, several pieces of knowledges about their area can prevent them from unpredictable unworthy encounters. Nowadays, our community is crammed with sophisticated scammers, so people can easily contact those bad individuals. They can have a land agreement with land in a dispute and be evicted by authorities in the future time. Hence, people can be scammed with a huge income without awareness of their house's history. \n In order to be conscious of danger, some remedies can be given to people. Firstly, going around the neighborhood and asking neighbors about the house or building is possible. Residences nearby can give information about the former owner of the house and what strange stories happening in the past. They can also warn the next owner if the house is still the property of another one. Another solution is asking leaders of the residential group or the area's government.

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: It appears there is a misalignment between the essay's content and the intended prompt. The focus should be more on why individuals wish to know the history of their residences and how they can acquire such information. Consider restructuring the essay to directly address these points.

2. **Clarity and Cohesion**: The essay introduces two main reasons for the interest in residential history but fails to connect these reasons with clear, coherent transitions. Instead of using ""additionally"" to link unrelated points, it's advisable to introduce each reason with a separate transition that clarifies the relationship between your ideas. 

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several instances where spelling and grammar errors distract from the content. For example, ""humankind is gradually curious"" could be more accurately written as ""humankind has grown increasingly curious"". Attention to such details will significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.

4. **Specificity and Descriptive Arguments**: Your essay would benefit from more specific examples and clearer argumentation. While you mention the potential for legal disputes and scams, elaborating on how exactly knowing the history of a building or land can prevent these outcomes would strengthen your argument. Consider incorporating examples or more detailed explanations to support your points.

5. **Conclusion Enhancement**: The conclusion of the essay should succinctly restate your main points in a way that showcases your understanding and ability to synthesize information. Aim for a more detailed conclusion of 3-5 sentences that revisits your thesis and main arguments in a fresh light, demonstrating a full circle understanding of the topic.

6. **Seek Simplicity**: Simplify your language to enhance understanding and ensure your points are conveyed clearly. Avoid convoluted sentences and ensure each sentence directly contributes to your overall argument.

Specifically, there is no surprise that enterprises prefer female employees because they can take the deadline seriously and ensure to meet them. Besides, women are known to be more creative. Nowadays, a new trend is observed in some advertising agencies which have seen a rise of women in creative roles in an organization. For instance, some of the positions that require creativity in company such as copywriters, planners, etc are responsible for women. However, the statistics also show that these ladies are usually headed by a male, who runs the work, takes the awards and promotions. \n Women also play an important role in the family's finances. Currently, working mothers contribute to the financial resources of the household, or they also use their salaries for children's education. Moreover, many women have become the main source of income in many houses, especially single mothers or those who are divorced. If these women were denied to get the opportunity to have fixed positions in firms, they are not capable of raising their offspring or paying for living expenses.

The submission raises relevant points about the role and recognition of women in professional settings and their impact on family finances.

Firstly, it is crucial to ensure your essay directly responds to the given prompt. Your introduction briefly mentions the issue of women facing challenges in promotions within companies, which is a good start. However, when presenting your argument, it's beneficial to structure your response to closely align with the question. Begin by clearly stating the issue at hand, followed by your stance, and then justify your position with well-structured reasoning. Your personal opinion, while valuable, should be substantiated with evidence or more detailed reasoning and ideally, saved for the latter part of your introduction after you've clearly outlined the issue and your thesis.

In terms of style and language, certain expressions and words can be refined for academic writing. For example, avoid using informal phrases such as ""etc."" as they do not contribute meaningfully to your argument and are not typically used in formal essays. Strive for specificity and clarity in your language to effectively convey your points.

Your arguments need to be directly tied to the main thesis of your essay. The discussion that women are generally more loyal, honest, and dedicated than men, while intended to support your stance, veers away from directly addressing the primary issue of women's promotional challenges in the workplace. Instead, focus on comparing the work ethics of both genders in relation to promotion opportunities to directly support your thesis. Similarly, while highlighting the crucial role women play in managing family finances is valuable, it's essential to connect this point clearly back to the main argument regarding workplace promotions. Explain how the challenges women face in gaining promotions directly affect their financial contributions to their families, thereby strengthening your argument.

Finally, cohesion and coherence in your essay can be improved by ensuring each point made directly supports your argument about the necessity for a fixed percentage of positions for women. This includes more explicitly connecting women's roles and contributions in professional settings to their opportunities for advancement, as well as tying their financial contributions to families back to the broader issue of gender equality in workplace promotions.

Overall, your essay broaches important discussions surrounding gender equality in the workplace.

First, people from different social classes are able to go to school. It is of great importance for disadvantaged students who live in remote or mountainous areas. Tuition fee would be no longer a burden for them so they can be relieved a gigantic amount of financial pressure. Thus, these students can make their all efforts to study and will not be distract by part-time jobs which used to earned money for tuition fee.

1. **Structure and Paragraphing**: The introduction and conclusion are too brief, not meeting the typical expectation of at least three sentences to fully set up and summarize the arguments. The introduction should offer a clearer overview of the topic and the specific points to be discussed. Similarly, the conclusion should succinctly recap the arguments made, linking back to the initial thesis to emphasize the stance. Expanding these sections will provide a more coherent and complete discussion and argumentation.
   
2. **Focus and Clarity of Arguments**: The body paragraphs should have a more focused approach. Currently, the essay shifts between outlining benefits and drawbacks without clearly tying back to the thesis in a defensive manner. The task is to defend a singular viewpoint, so ensure each paragraph unambiguously supports the main thesis with well-developed evidence and explanation. It's crucial to stick to one main idea per paragraph and elaborate on it thoroughly rather than introducing multiple topics that could lead to underdeveloped arguments.
   
3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the use of language is clear, but some sentences could be refined for better clarity and impact. Paying attention to the flow of ideas within paragraphs would also enhance readability. Small grammatical corrections and adjustments in sentence structure could further refine the essay. Proofreading for errors and revising sentences for a clearer expression of ideas are recommended steps.

4. **Arguments and Evidence**: The essay benefits from the inclusion of specific examples, such as the reference to Vietnam, which strengthens the argument by illustrating real-world implications. Continue to use such examples to support your points effectively. However, each point made needs to be fully developed, exploring its implications and how it supports the overall argument in favor of or against free university education. This includes providing more detailed explanations and considering counterarguments to reinforce the position taken.

By focusing on these areas—ensuring a strong and clear structure, focusing arguments, refining grammar and style, and developing points with solid evidence—the essay can become a more compelling and persuasive piece.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4365,https://essayforum.com/writing/reason-learn-languages-travel-work-overseas-93300/,test,Is the only reason for learn languages is to travel and work overseas or not. Discuss both views.,"Travel overseas or working in an international environment are supposed by some people to be the sole reason for studying other languages. However, others argue that they are not the main excuse for this activity. From my point of view, the former opinion is not completely correct, since learning languages has a lot of advantages, which make people decide to master them. \n On the one hand, it is undeniable that the opportunities of traveling and working in a foreign country is one of the reasons for learning languages. The ability to speak other languages fluently, especially English, Chinese,... gives you the chance to go abroad or become employees of oversea or multinational entrepreneurs and helps you get a brighter future since you can broaden your horizon and show off your talents. What's more, those companies are also famous for excellent facilities, high salary and good compensation, which make people want to study languages in order to work there. \n However, the aforementioned thing isn't the aim of all learners. Personally, I think that the core function of languages is making communication become easier for those who come from different countries. For that reason, many people start learning another language with an aim of interacting more effectively with their counterparts, partners or making new friends. Moreover, in this globalization era, more and more documents are written in some common languages. As a result, the ability to understand these languages can help humans be exposed to a variety of knowledge all over the world. For example, university students tend to search for materials in English since most of the research results have English versions. \n In conclusion, even though going and working overseas is a driving force for some people when learning new languages, it is not the only one purpose since benefits of being multilingual are countless, which results in many other aims.","The writer shows incorrect punctuation usage in the presentation. Any student of written English knows that the basic punctuation rule is that these have to be used one at a time. These cannot be used successively, as in a comma then ellipses, because each punctuation mark delivers a different emphasis and meaning for the presented sentence. When these are consecutively used, GRA deductions will apply since the reader will not be clear as to what the actual meaning of the sentence is. Is it a statement or a continued listing of information? Such confusing considerations will hinder the ability of the writer to create coherent and cohesive sentences. This is a common problem found among ESL learners who do not seem to pay attention to the punctuation mark usage lessons in their ESL classes. \n As for the discussion itself, the comparison of the public opinion against the writer's personal opinion is not properly identified in the discussion. Grammar rules regarding position clarity are not applied when the main discussion format is not used. The discussion format required being ""public v. personal opinion"" discussed over 2 paragraphs. The main writing should be indicative of public support that one opinion and why the writer opposes it and public support for the contrasting opinion and why the writer supports it. General discussion presentations, though accepted in the test, limit the scores that can be awarded due to the lack of opinion separation and discussion development.","Your essay offers a thoughtful analysis on the importance and benefits of learning new languages. It presents a perspective that while many people learn languages for travel or work opportunities, there are also other significant reasons, such as improving communication across different countries and accessing a broader range of knowledge. This perspective enriches the essay by showing a well-rounded understanding of the topic. However, to enhance your essay's clarity, impact, and coherence, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Punctuation Usage:**
Your essay exhibits instances of incorrect punctuation usage, particularly the consecutive use of differing punctuation marks (like a comma followed by ellipses). This practice can confuse readers about the sentence's intended meaning and structure because each punctuation mark conveys unique emphasis and intent. To improve, aim to use only one punctuation mark at a time, ensuring that your sentence delivers a clear and precise message. This adjustment will make your writing more professional and easier to follow.

2. **Clarity of Opinion and Argumentation:**
While your essay hints at contrasting viewpoints regarding the motivations for learning new languages, the distinction between public opinion and your personal perspective could be more explicit. A clearer separation and development of these viewpoints would not only strengthen your argumentation but also increase the coherence of your essay. Consider dedicating one paragraph to discussing the commonly held belief about learning languages for travel and work, followed by another paragraph that explains your personal view and the additional reasons people might choose to learn new languages. This structure will provide a clearer framework for your argument, making it easier for readers to understand and follow your reasoning.

3. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues:**
Watch out for minor grammar errors and stylistic issues throughout your essay. For example, there’s a mix of singular and plural forms (""the opportunities of traveling and working in a foreign country is..."") that needs correction for consistency. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to keep your writing engaging. Addressing these issues will not only enhance the readability of your essay but also demonstrate your command of the English language.

4. **Supporting Arguments:**
Your essay would benefit from more detailed examples and explanations to support your arguments. While you mention the importance of learning languages for improved communication and accessing knowledge, providing specific instances or elaborating on these points could make your arguments more convincing and impactful.

In summary, your essay presents valuable insights into the motivations behind learning new languages. By refining your punctuation usage, clarifying your position and the structure of your argument, addressing minor grammatical issues, and strengthening your supporting evidence, you will significantly enhance the quality and persuasiveness of your writing. Keep exploring and presenting nuanced perspectives in your essays, as this approach enriches the discourse on any topic.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

However, many argue that our life will be no longer hustle and bustle anymore if we do not use smartphones. \n One the one hand, smartphone has numerous benefits.

That is, the part of the prompt that asks for your opinion on the topic. Your personal opinion is (required) to be presented as part of the opening statement, along with the paraphrased prompt. Without a significant ownership of the opinion to be presented in the essay, the reader, will not be aware of the type of essay that you have written for his review. The concluding paragraph is flawed because you started a sentence with the word ""And"" which is actually a connecting word. So without a prior thought to connect to the sentence, you have a grammatically inaccurate sentence in that paragraph. Though your line of reasoning is good and is representative of the prompt requirements, the fact that you made some serious errors at the start and end of the essay has left me with the opinion that your score in this case will fall somewhere between a 4 or 5, based upon the more detailed requirements of the examiner.","This essay successfully addresses the topic by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of smartphones, making a clear stance in the conclusion that having smartphones makes life better and more modern. However, there are several areas for improvement to make the essay stronger and clearer. 

Firstly, it's important to state your personal opinion clearly in the introduction. The essay should begin by paraphrasing the prompt and then directly stating your viewpoint. This approach makes it clear to the reader what to expect from the essay and establishes your position from the start.

Regarding grammar and sentence structure, there are a few points to address:

1. Avoid starting sentences with the word ""And,"" as this is a connecting word and should not be used to begin sentences. Instead, strive for complete sentences that stand alone without needing connectors at their start.
2. Watch out for spelling and grammatical errors. For example, ""Compare to the first generation of telephones which are bulky..."" should be ""Compared to the first generation of telephones, which were bulky...""
3. Be cautious with word choice to ensure clarity and accuracy. For instance, ""not only do they use to text messages..."" could be improved to ""not only are they used to send text messages...""
4. The phrase ""smartphone has numerous benefits"" should be pluralized to ""smartphones have numerous benefits"" to match the plural subject.

Your arguments on both the pros and cons of smartphones are well-presented but could be made stronger with more specific examples and a clearer connection between your points and your overall argument. For instance, when discussing the negative aspects of smartphone use, providing specific examples of how relationships improve without them or how stress levels decrease can offer a more compelling argument.

Finally, it’s vital to conclude your essay without introducing new information or starting a sentence with conjunctions like ""And."" The conclusion should succinctly summarize your arguments and restate your stance in a way that reflects the discussions made in the essay.

By addressing these areas of improvement, focusing on clarity, and emphasizing your personal viewpoint throughout the essay, you can enhance the effectiveness of your writing and better engage your reader.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

I don't think so - they do not have emotions,"Nowadays, computers are integral parts of almost every activity, including education. Moreover, they are now more sophisticated than ever, which makes some people think that they will shortly replace teachers. I, however, would argue that teachers are irreplaceable and in this essay I am going show why. \n First of all, students acquire more than just simple facts from teachers; they acquire social and communicational skills as well, such as the appropriate use of body language. In contrast, computers can not mimic postures, gestures, or even a smile. This is a problem because body language plays an important role in communication and learning; they can emphasize our words or contradict our statements. Without a human educator, students will not suffer from the lack of this essential skill. \n Moreover, computers, no matter how advanced they are, do not have emotions. They can not show love, care, or comfort. This is a problem because such emotions are important to stimulate the learning process and to trigger students to be more involved in education by feeling comfortable to participate in class or to ask questions. The absence of emotions in education, in addition to hinder the learning process, might damage students' characters by making them feel rejected or unloved. \n In conclusion, it is not arguable that the immense advances in computer technology made them capable of replacing some jobs; however, I do not think that they are advanced enough to replace teachers. Teachers are not simply facilitators of facts, but have some skills that can not be copied by computers, like positive body language and emotions.","There is a prompt deviation on the part of your restatement. Kindly compare the following to see how you accidentally committed the error: \n Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree? \n Response: I, however, would argue that teachers are irreplaceable and in this essay I am going show why. \n The lack of proper response means your starting TA score will be rated based on unrelated response. Always review your essay for prompt accuracy after you draft your response. Make sure that your response supports the discussion instructions or responds to the question posed. In this case, you can clearly see why your essay will start at a scoring disadvantage from the very start. While your reasoning paragraphs are somewhat supportive of the given discussion topic and question, I do not believe that this will be enough to help you get a passing score in an actual test. Most specially since you do not have an appropriate summary conclusion presented. You continued to discuss your opinion in the last paragraph, creating a non-concluded essay. The lack of summary in the summary conclusion will also force additional deductions on your TA score.","Your essay effectively communicates your viewpoint that teachers are irreplaceable by computers, despite advances in technology. This response to the importance of human educators is commendable for its strong stance and clear arguments. However, there are several areas where your essay could be enhanced to better meet the expectations of English proficiency tests and ensure your ideas are communicated clearly and effectively.

Firstly, your essay’s introduction slightly deviates from the prompt’s question, which asks to what extent you agree or disagree. Your response, ""I, however, would argue that teachers are irreplaceable and in this essay I am going to show why,"" does not explicitly state the extent of your agreement or disagreement. It is crucial to directly address the question in your thesis statement to avoid starting at a scoring disadvantage. I recommend rephrasing your thesis statement to clearly indicate the extent of your stance in relation to the prompt.

Additionally, while your body paragraphs provide supportive arguments regarding the value of human interaction and emotions in teaching, which are strengths in your essay, these arguments can be further improved. For greater clarity and to strengthen your position, consider incorporating examples or more detailed explanations of how emotions and body language contribute to the learning process. This would provide a stronger and more persuasive argument in favor of the irreplaceability of teachers.

Regarding your conclusion, it’s important to summarize your key points succinctly and reinforce your stance without introducing new arguments. Your current closing leans towards continuing the discussion rather than conclusively summarizing your position. A well-defined conclusion restates the main arguments and reinforces the extent to which you agree or disagree with the prompt, leaving the reader with a clear understanding of your viewpoint.

On the matter of spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, your essay is quite well-written. Nonetheless, paying close attention to ensuring subject-verb agreement, consistent tense usage, and the correct use of articles can help in making your essay even more polished. For example, make sure sentences like ""students will not suffer from the lack of this essential skill"" accurately reflect your intended meaning, as it currently presents a slightly unclear message.

In conclusion, to improve your essay:
- Directly state the extent of your agreement or disagreement with the prompt in your thesis.
- Use examples or further elaboration to strengthen your arguments in your body paragraphs.
- Ensure your conclusion succinctly summarizes your arguments and firmly states your position.
- Review your essay for any minor grammatical or stylistic errors to enhance clarity and professionalism.

Depending on personal experience, personality type, and emotional concern, people differ greatly in their attitudes toward this issue. As far as I am concerned, I disagree with this statement that having low accuracy in work is important than working accurately. In the following, I will try to explain the specific reasons which I think are the most common viewpoints nowadays. \n To begin with, one of the compelling reasons that justifies my opinion is that high accurate working is a kind of giving respect to customers. When one pays much attention to his or her work, the customer who buys the outcome of the work is more satisfied and do not feel that he or she waste their time or money. For example, I work on internet as a freelancer, which means that I work at home rather than an office. and I get all of my credits by doing my job in the best way that one can imagine. I think today's customer are very delicate toward their demands and they easily distinguish the quality of the outcome. Thus, it seems that delivering a work with the high quality would be the first thing that every employee should be asked for. \n Another equally notable point supporting my opinion is that wining the business competition is a crucial factor in today's world.

I think the most important factor that helps companies to maintain their costumers is delivering high quality outcome. \n To sum up, by taking into account all the above factors, we may reach the conclusion that having high accuracy in work is far important than working quickly due to people distinguished the quality of the outcome and compare it to another company.","Dear student, you need to provide the complete original prompt when you post your essay so that we can accurately review and consider your essay writing skills.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay suggests that you understood the topic, but without the original prompt, it's challenging to evaluate whether the essay fully addresses the prompt's requirements. Always include the original question or statement with your essay.

2. **Grammar and Style:** There are some grammatical errors and stylistic issues that need attention. The essay contains run-on sentences that make it difficult to follow. Shortening these sentences can help improve clarity and understanding. Furthermore, consistent punctuation errors, such as missing commas and improper use of ""and,"" disrupt the flow. For example, ""I work on the internet as a freelancer, which means that I work at home rather than in an office, and I get all of my credits by doing my job in the best way one can imagine,"" would be clearer and more grammatically correct.

Make sure each sentence contributes to your argument without wandering off-topic. Using clear and simple language can enhance the effectiveness of your essay. 

4. **Argument Support:** You've presented arguments supporting the importance of accuracy over speed, which is good. However, providing more specific examples or evidence could strengthen your position. Discussing a personal experience or citing a study could help reinforce your argument.

5. **Essay Structure:** Try to keep your paragraphs organized and within a reasonable length. A good practice is to aim for around four paragraphs, with the conclusion being optional. This structure helps maintain clarity and ensures each point is properly developed without overwhelming the reader.

6. **Focus on Accuracy:** While you've made your viewpoint clear, it's also critical to ensure your essay stays on topic and directly addresses the statement or question from the beginning. Avoid veering into unrelated areas or overly broad statements that don't contribute directly to your argument.

Compared to conventional newspapers, journalists and editors can post information on their channels, such as Twitter, immediately; meanwhile, readers are capable of receiving updated news through a portable device without the time and space limits. Additionally, net-report can provide various contents. For example, family members may subscribe to several magazines from different companies a decade ago, but they can now access their preferred content through a small screen. Finally, the information delivered through the network can be easily stored and retrieved, reducing materials and transportation costs, like trees and fuels. \n On the other hand, the negative influence of electronic media popularity should be alarming. The most significant one is authenticity. The text published by a traditional news provider is usually verified and revised by multiple editors. However, the internet is filled with unconfirmed and even wrong messages because everyone can draft and send subjective and lopsided comments, which can mislead other viewers. Furthermore, some reporters and internet celebrities prefer to post adverse and exaggerated events because this news is easier to spread and gain more traffic.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The prompt seems to encourage a stance on whether the shift towards online media is positive or negative. While your effort to balance both views is commendable, for this type of essay, choosing one side to argue is necessary. You've concluded that not all outcomes of the online media trend have been positive, suggesting a leaning towards the negative effects. This stance should be the core of your essay.

Transition words can help make the progression of ideas smoother. Additionally, be cautious with repetitive phrases and aim to vary your sentence structure for a more engaging read. 

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view is hinted at but gets lost between the positives and negatives. Start with a clear thesis statement in your introduction that reflects your concluding opinion, reinforcing this perspective consistently throughout your essay. This approach solidifies your stance and makes your viewpoint unmistakable to the reader.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You've provided examples for both sides, which, while informative, dilutes your argument.

For instance, rather than simply listing the benefits of online media, discuss why these perceived benefits might contribute to or result in significant issues. 

Improvement also lies in refining the connection between your examples and your overall argument. Make it explicit how each point supports your stance on the negative implications of online media's rise, ensuring each paragraph contributes directly to building your case.

Nevertheless, from my perspective, there is a high probability that teachers will not be supplanted by artificial intelligence in the future. Furthermore, online classrooms led by human educators may be a viable substitution for conventional teaching. \n To commence with, there exist a plethora of catalysts for AI's inability to replace humanity in education, chief among which is the lack of emotional capabilities. Expanding on this point, since AI is made from bare algorithms and mechanisms, its ability to express emotions is out of the question. This will possibly act as a deterrent in the tutoring work, such as giving feedback to students or grasping their psychological states. On the contrary, human educators can almost exactly identify their students' needs through emotional understanding; thus, offering actionable succor for them. Another worth mentioning contributing factor is the paucity of personalized experience. In light of machines' rigid programmes, their educational methodology can be monotonous, which easily results in pupils' loss of interest. Conversely, teachers can improvise, incorporating interesting stories or trends into the lessons to significantly increase students' attention and efficiency. \n Alternatively, a feasible substitute for traditional face-to-face teaching is education via the internet. To be specific, online teaching is bound to offer great flexibility in terms of time and pace, which is not a feature of the conventional method. This is because students may possess the freedom to arrange their schedules and pursue their schooling at their own speed. Furthermore, internet-based tutoring can have a conspicuously wider reach, providing several opportunities for disabled individuals or those from far-flung places. Moreover, chances are that they can also have access to the best education from certified educators. \n To recapitulate, there are a multitude of reasons why technology hasn't been able to act as a replacement for human teachers. Additionally, online courses may make a practical alternative option for schooling.","The establishing topic restatement in the first sentence does not represent the original thought process.

Here's how you could improve your essay:

1. **Response to Topic**: The initial sentence of your essay should immediately encapsulate the main argument in response to the essay prompt. It's essential to directly state your stance and outline your main points succinctly within the first few sentences. This sets a clear direction for your essay.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Moving forward, try to articulate your points more clearly and directly. You have a tendency to use complex and lengthy sentences, which might confuse readers. Simplifying your language could make your arguments more accessible and engaging. For example, instead of saying ""In this technology-driven era, AI has been at the core of a myriad of occupations that were previously carried out by humans,"" you could say, ""In our technology-driven world, AI now performs many jobs once done by humans."" 

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your essay is generally well-written with minor errors. Pay attention to simpler sentence structures and active voice to enhance readability. Also, watch out for overly complex words where simpler ones will do. This will also help in keeping the focus on your argument rather than on the vocabulary.

4. **Point of View**: Your perspective that AI cannot replace human teachers due to the lack of emotional insight and the need for personalized teaching methods is clear and well-argued. It would be beneficial to introduce contrasting viewpoints to deepen the analysis but remember to refute these effectively to strengthen your original stance.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: You provide compelling reasons to support your viewpoint, such as the emotional capabilities of human teachers and their ability to personalize learning experiences. However, providing concrete examples or citing educational research could enhance your argument's credibility. Also, while discussing online education, mentioning specific benefits alongside potential challenges could offer a more balanced view.

6. **Staying on Topic**: Ensure every point you make directly supports your stance on why AI cannot replace human teachers and how online education could be a complementary method rather than a detraction from your main argument. By staying focused, your essay will have a stronger impact.

In summary, focusing on directness in stating your position, simplifying your language, supporting your arguments with examples, and ensuring clarity in your reasoning will all help in crafting a more compelling and effective essay.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

But this might not be always true. Most young minds have intuition to achieve good and sane things. \n The need for importance to be given to picking worthy goals has many other reasons. Firstly, youth lacks proper direction. For example, young A.P.J Abdul Kalam was drawn towards astronautics and aeronautics. If his teacher in school would have recognised his interest and guided him to carry out a course on Astronautics, India would have a missed an amazing talent of Kalam. \n Secondly, youth are fascinated by power and money and thus, their dreams would be based on these factors than true passion and zeal. \n Hence, proper guidance and career counselling should be given all young minds. It would be great change if career counselling is including as part of college or school curriculum. For example, I have seen most of my friends rushing to Computer Science Engineering course just to earn money without any interest towards the subject and most parents support the same. This should be changed and right direction should be showed. \n It can also be agreed to some extent that people dreams sometimes are selfish. They are selfishly driven to earn money and live a life of luxury.

But the importance to set right goals need not be just for the reason that young minds are driven by selfish motives but also because in most cases they lack guidance, direction and support. Totally, dream is a initial phase where as implementing and achieving the dream in right way is what matters eventually.","due to the existing problems with your essay, I do not believe that it can score higher than a 2. If you noticed, you did not clearly respond to the prompt requirement. There was no statement of agreement or disagreement with the statement provided. You instead tried to rely on quotes from people notable only in your society to try and explain your analysis of the essay. There is no proper referencing towards a logical flow of thought that would have helped you to properly analyze, represent, and explain your stance on the given statement. The format that you used for writing this essay is not in the GRE analytical format but rather and IELTS format discussion that relies mostly on public knowledge rather than a strong analysis based on critical thinking of the given statement. When you write this essay, you must dissect the original statement, looking for potential loopholes in the presentation that you can exploit in the discussion that you will be creating. That is how this essay is developed and written.","Your essay on the importance of following dreams for young individuals provides an interesting take highlighted by examples and quotes. However, there are areas where it could be significantly improved to ensure clarity and stronger argumentation. Let’s consider the suggestions below:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay somewhat strays from explicitly addressing the essay prompt. It’s crucial for essays, especially those for English proficiency tests, to directly respond to the given topic. Make sure to clearly state whether you agree or disagree with the prompt at the beginning and consistently support this stance throughout. 

2. **Use of Quotes**: While quotes from notable individuals like A.P.J Abdul Kalam and Jawaharlal Nehru enrich the essay, relying heavily on them without providing personal analysis or a clear linkage to your argument weakens the effectiveness of your message. Try to balance quotes with your own thoughts and analyses to make your argument stronger and more personalized.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some minor spelling and grammar mistakes, as well as instances of awkward phrasing (“importance for young people to follow their dreams and emphasis should be laid on refining dream into action plan”). Proofreading and using simpler, clearer language can help improve readability and coherence.

4. **Point of View Clarity**: Your viewpoint on the importance of following dreams is implicit; however, it could be made more explicit. Early on, clearly state your perspective and consistently support it throughout the essay. This will help readers understand and follow your argument more easily.

5. **Argumentation and Support**: You’ve attempted to provide reasons and examples to support your views, which is good. Yet, the connection between your arguments and the overarching theme of the essay (the importance or challenges of following dreams) could be stronger and more coherent. Focus on creating a logical flow of ideas that directly supports your point of view. 

6. **Format and Critical Thinking**: Your essay resembles more of a discussion than an analytical argument. For English proficiency tests, it's essential to showcase critical thinking. Analyze the prompt critically, point out any potential flaws or assumptions, and build your argument based on this analysis. Ensure your essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs each focusing on a single argument, and a conclusive summary.

7. **Specific Examples and Generalization**: While examples like A.P.J Abdul Kalam’s interest in astronautics are compelling, ensure you also discuss broader examples or statistics that can resonate with a wider audience. Not all references may be familiar to everyone, so adding universally relatable content can make your essay more impactful.

In summary, focusing on these areas can significantly enhance your essay's clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness. Remember, the goal is to clearly present and support your position on the topic while demonstrating your critical thinking and writing abilities.",3,4,4,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,Argumentative

The word limit is 210 words","A wise use of the economy consists of investing in practical long term and short term projects. Although investing in space exploration may help solve some environmental issues, it will ultimately do more harm than good. This is because of factors such as the amount of focus the project would require and its impracticality. \n Renowned economist Richard Ludwig, once said 'Public facilities are the culmination of the trust between the government and the people!' Public opinion is shaped and sculpted by the services available to them and good facilities are like sharp knives, carving out a relationship between government and public, one that is strong and sturdy. Therefore investing in space exploration will do more harm than good as it will lead to less funding of public facilities. \n A Vision is a double-edged sword, it can truly make or break a project. In the current governments case, this vision will break the project. As both the cause and the goals set out are impractical, and when this is the case, failure is inevitable. \n On the other hand, exploration may help solve such environmental problems as global warming. This would be a direct result of having lifted the burdens of industry on earth and having placed them on another planet. \n In conclusion, space exploration isn't beneficial as it comes with the consequences of losing trust and almost inevitable failure.","Since you already knew beforehand that you are allowed to write only up to 210 words, why did you present me with a 224 word essay to review? You do know that you will be expected to edit your writing for word count and clarity during the actual test right? It is best that you begin that practice during your practice essays. That way you will be automatically trained to edit your word count, along with the clarity of the presentation. Remember to automatically do that next time. You will benefit from it during the actual test. \n The first sentence of your article should be directly related to space exploration. When writing articles, the first sentence should always kick off with a topic sentence because the reader expects to be clued into the content of the presentation paragraph right off. I am not sure how beneficial the quote from Richard Ludwig will be during the actual test since you may not have the benefit of using the internet at the testing center. So it is better to stick to a personalized discussion of the given topic. \n Kindly remember to proof read your paper for grammar and writing errors prior to submission. Failure to proofread results in words that do not need to be capitalized being capitalized and remaining so without correction. Such errors will affect your score because of your grammar rule violation. Proof reading and editing is of the utmost importance in any English language test as it proves your ability to correctly use the English language in the manner required.","Your essay presents a clear standpoint on the controversial topic of space exploration, arguing that it does more harm than good. This position is articulated through various arguments concerning practicality, government priorities, and the potential for failure. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to enhance clarity, relevance, and adherence to the prompt and test requirements.

1. **Relevance to Topic:** Your first sentence introduces a broad statement about the economy which does not directly tie into space exploration. For a more focused introduction, consider starting with a sentence that directly addresses space exploration. This ensures that your readers immediately understand your essay's central topic.

2. **Word Count:** Your essay exceeds the allowed word count of 210 words. It's important to practice writing within set limits to convey your message effectively and concisely. Consider removing or condensing less critical details to meet the required word count, enhancing the overall clarity and impact of your essay.

3. **Use of External Quotes:** While the quote from ""Richard Ludwig"" aims to support your argument, remember that you might not have access to external sources during the test. Relying on your own reasoning and discussion of the topic often makes your argument stronger and more personal.

4. **Grammar and Style:** Your essay would benefit from careful proofreading. There are instances of unnecessary capitalization and some grammatical errors that could distract from your message. Pay particular attention to ensuring that sentences are grammatically sound and that capitalization is used correctly. This not only strengthens your argument but also demonstrates your command of English.

5. **Clarity of Arguments:** While your position on the topic is clear, some arguments could be further developed with specific examples or clearer reasoning. For instance, when discussing the impracticality of space exploration, providing specific examples or elaborating on why you believe this to be the case would make your argument stronger.

6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion successfully restates your main argument but could be enriched by briefly summarizing the key points made throughout the essay. This reinforces your position and leaves a stronger impression on the reader.

By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can enhance the effectiveness, clarity, and relevance of your essay. Remember, practice in editing and refining your essays will be invaluable not just for passing tests, but also for developing your overall writing skills.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

People usually take one side over the other, despite not having any idea about the subject. But in my case, I totally disagree that only the politicians should take this responsibility with my title statement reason below. \n First of all, the reason why I disagree with the title that only politicians should take this responsibility of reducing the environment damage is that I believe everybody has the responsibility to take care of environment pollution. Simply speaking, if we want to reduce the environment damage, we should start doing it by ourself instead of asking politicians to solve it by their own. Also, the environment damage now is too serious to be solved by only politicians. \n On the other hands, there are a variety of reasons why people hold the above argument. First, Some people might think that this is part of the responsibility of being a politician. For instance, they think if politicians want to win the election or to be supported by people, they should do somethings that can help this society to earn people's vote. Second, politicians can make influent easily, so if politicians can start doing it first, people who support him would likely to do it as well. \n In my conclusion, I would state my opinion to this issue after analyzing these arguments, It is truly that everyone should be aware of this issue and start making a move to prevent the environment damage.","Always restate the original topic in your own words.

If you continue to write using this format, you should not expect to pass the test.","The essay presents an argument on the responsibility of reducing environmental damage, contrasting individual responsibility with political responsibility. Upon analyzing the essay, here are the areas that could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness:

1. **Understanding and Restating the Topic**: It's important to start your essay by clearly restating the topic in your own words to show you understand what you are being asked to discuss. Instead of jumping into the discussion, take a moment to paraphrase the given topic. This will not only demonstrate your understanding but also provide a solid foundation for your arguments. Avoid adding unrelated information or assumptions that weren't in the original prompt, as this can detract from the focus and clarity of your argument.

2. **Clarity in References**: The essay often mentions ""the title statement"" or ""the title."" It seems you are referring to the main argument or topic of the essay. To improve clarity and coherence, directly refer to the topic as ""the issue at hand"" or ""the argument about environmental responsibility"" instead of ""the title."" This will help make your essay more understandable and flow better.

3. **Development of Arguments**: Your essay presented a viewpoint disagreeing with the belief that only politicians are responsible for addressing environmental damage. This is a strong start, but your arguments could be further developed and supported with more specific examples or evidence. Consider mentioning real-life initiatives where individual actions have led to positive environmental changes or studies that emphasize the significance of collective effort in addition to political action.

4. **Grammar and Style Issues**: There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues within your essay. For example, ""environment damage"" should be ""environmental damage,"" and ""on the other hands"" should be ""on the other hand."" Paying attention to these details can significantly enhance the readability of your essay. It's also beneficial to vary your sentence structure to keep your writing engaging.

5. **Conclusion and Restatement of Your Viewpoint**: In your conclusion, you did well to summarize your stance. However, making your perspective clear and strong from the beginning and throughout the essay can strengthen your argument. Conclude with a summary that not only restates your position but also highlights the key points discussed to reinforce your argument.

Before attempting another essay, it might be helpful to review example essays to familiarize yourself with various discussion formats and strategies for developing and presenting arguments effectively. This can provide insight into structurally sound and coherent essay writing for English proficiency tests.

Aside from the topics that you will learn schools should try to do more for their students. They must try to instill certain values that the school thinks would be beneficial for their students to have. Furthermore beyond the mental aspect of an individual. Schools have to also think about how to ensure the physical well-being of their students. The value of health cannot be overstated. It literally dictates whether or not we get to live. \n Personally, I think schools should require their students to go through physical education courses. Provided that the student is physically capable and there are no other causes for concern regarding the student doing the activities. Even if some students may not take kindly to being required to take physical education courses. It is still in their best interest and I think the school should understand this and push their students. \n ------END------- \n I tried to write something within an hour to emulate what it's like writing something in school.","There are 2 ways to approach the riting of this essay.

Direct discussion \n The difference between the 2 is that the former allows you to highlight hour well you can interpret an English discussion.The latter, immediately highlights your English thinking and writing style. The commonality of the 2 is the need for strong English comprehension skills. In this writing, the student shows logical English prowess, but tends to overdiscuss to the point of topic alteration. The focus of the discussion should focus on that foundation without meddling the discussion with values references. \n When writing a 2 paragraph direct response, one must be certain of his opinion since this has to be proven to be the correct and acceptable opinion. Words of uncertainty create a sense of doubt because you have made your own opinion weak. ""I think"" has no place in an opinion or analytical essay. \n Good job reasoning out though. It is not a bad first attempt. There is definitely room for improvement based upon this presentation. The writing skill can be developed easily.","The essay addresses the topic by discussing the role of schools in ensuring both the academic and physical well-being of their students, particularly emphasizing the importance of physical education. However, the discussion could benefit from a more focused approach, particularly by directly addressing the prompt and reinforcing opinions with more specific arguments and examples.

Firstly, while the essay opens up the discussion on the importance of physical education in schools, the argument would be stronger with more specific instances or data to back up why physical education is essential. Including real-life examples or studies showing the benefits of physical activity for students could enhance the persuasiveness of the argument.

In terms of structure and clarity, the essay currently blends the discussion of mental and physical well-being without a clear distinction between the two. A more structured approach, perhaps by dedicating a separate section to each aspect and then tying them together, could help in making the essay more coherent and impactful.

Regarding the language and style, the writing demonstrates a reasonable level of English understanding. However, there are instances of ambiguity and a somewhat informal tone, which could be refined. For example, using phrases like ""I think"" introduces a tone of uncertainty. Being more assertive in stating opinions or arguments—such as ""It is essential that schools require physical education courses""—would make the positions stronger and more persuasive.

Spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues are minimal, but paying close attention to these aspects can always benefit the overall quality of writing. Ensuring that the essay is free from errors and employs a consistent and formal tone throughout would improve its professional feel.

To enhance the effectiveness of the argument, it's vital that the point of view is presented with confidence and supported by clear, logical arguments. While the personal opinion on the necessity of physical education is evident, reinforcing this viewpoint with stronger evidence and a more decisive tone would make the argument more compelling.

In conclusion, this essay shows a good understanding of the topic and presents a relevant argument about the importance of physical education in schools. By focusing on providing more structured and evidence-backed arguments, employing a more formal and decisive tone, and refining the overall coherence and presentation of ideas, there is an excellent opportunity to strengthen the essay further.

Do you think this is a positive or negative social development?,"With the tremendous pace of globalization, it is expected that a universal language would be used as a means of communication. While the trend has advantages, I strongly believe that it would be seriously detrimental to humans being. \n On the one hand, emergence of a global language brings benefits in terms of educational perspective. Universal language facilitates the exposure to knowledge constructed many countries in the world without barriers. In Vietnam, for example people could effortlessly broaden their horizon from technological advancements of developed nation like the United States through books and television because these information sources are used the same language. Furthermore, the phenomenon also accelerates the economic growth. In industrialization's era, a host of grant groups maximize their profit by carrying out trade strategies and expand investment in over the world. When people are beyond the language boundaries, it is easier for partnership to collaborate and exchange contracts and therefore increases their productivity for both host nations and foreign investors. \n On the other hand, the adoption of universal language inevitably triggers many serious problems. Firstly, language assimilation leads to the extinction of minority ones and trivialization of cultural identities which are attached to it. Dialect for instance, is a popular means of communication of some communities which symbolize origins and valuable traditional customs and the values were formed and developed over thousands of decade ago. If the language lost away, it is inevitable that the beauty of ancient culture would be faded into obscurity. In fact, the disappearance of indigenous languages affects adversely cultural diversity. Furthermore, historical values also put at stake as a consequence of this trend. It is clear that many written documentaries which recorded victories in the past only are preserved in museums instead of using as information to educate patriotism due to the fact later generations have not relevant knowledge of country's language. \n In conclusion, although a universal language has several benefits, the drawbacks are far more significant.","Dear student, you cannot say ""thousand of decade ago"". A decade is equal to 10 years, which is a singular form of the word as it represents 1 decade. When you say ""thousands"" you are referring to the plural form of decade so it should be written as ""thousands of decades..."" with an S to signify the plural form of the word. This is a noun phrase disagreement that you should be conscious of. \n By the way, you wrote too many words. You cannot handwrite 322 words within 40 minutes during the test. It cannot be done. You can only write between 250-275 words, leaving some minutes for the editing of your work. If you write 300 or more, you will not be able to edit your paper before submitting it and the errors you made will remain and be considered when scoring your paper. You need to write only the right number of words so that you can present a proof read paper at the very least. \n This is also a single opinion, not a comparison paper. By asking you; <em>""Do you think this is a positive or negative social development?""</em> , the discussion indicates that you are to choose one side of the discussion to support in your reasoning paragraphs using at least 2 supporting reasons/examples. Your essay is doing a comparison format discussion which runs counter to your indicated opinion of; <em>""I strongly believe that it would be seriously detrimental to humans being.""</em> Therefore the essay will only be scored for the discussion that falls under the proper TA response that you presented in your paraphrase. \n Your concluding sentence is unacceptable. That has to be in the form of a reverse paraphrase. It must indicate the topic for discussion, your opinion, supporting reasons, and a closing sentence. It must be composed of at least 3 sentences to be considered a complete paragraph. This is the same mistake that you made with your original prompt paraphrase so that it also fell under the minimum sentence requirement.","The essay approaches the topic of the impact of a universal language on globalization by articulating both advantages and disadvantages, which forms a comprehensive response. However, it seems there is confusion in maintaining a focused argument. The prompt suggests picking a single viewpoint; thus, focusing on one perspective, either supporting or opposing the concept of a universal language, would enhance clarity and adhere to the requirements.

Firstly, there's a notable issue with word count. An ideal essay should range between 250-275 words to manage time effectively for both writing and proofreading. The current essay exceeds this limit, which might hinder the opportunity to correct mistakes before submission. Remember, a concise and well-edited essay is more impactful than a longer, unedited one.

Additionally, there are grammatical issues to address. For example, the phrase ""thousands of decade ago"" incorrectly combines singular and plural forms. It should be ""thousands of decades ago"" to maintain noun phrase agreement. Paying closer attention to such details will significantly improve the grammatical accuracy of the writing.

Regarding structure, the conclusion needs more development. A well-structured conclusion should briefly recap the topic, state your opinion clearly, summarize supporting reasons, and end with a closing sentence. Aim for at least three sentences to form a complete paragraph that effectively wraps up your essay.

Remember, clarity is key. Simplify complex sentences and ensure that your argument is easy to follow. This will not only make your essay more accessible to a wider audience but also help you avoid common pitfalls related to sentence structure and coherence.

It is undeniable that citizens from many nations around the world have been working hard and spend many hours on that. The main reason for this situation is the burden of finance. This essay will outline the justification and explain why this is a negative reform. \n First of all, finance is the only reason that makes people pursuit of working. The fast development, especially in technology and economics, has resulted in expensive price. In other words, people in this day have to work harder in order to earn more money to pay for many demands of normal lives. For instance, the cost of housing, technology devices, or facilities has become higher than in the past a lot. It is clear why many people have to work harder or spend long hours at work. \n This development does not seem to bring a beneficial effect on our lives. Japan is a prime example. News about self suicide due to stress working is popular and easy to be seen in Japan - where employers have to spend almost 18 hours a day for working. The rate of self-killing has never been rising as high as they did. One of the main reason for this unexpected situation is working is so stress and gradually lead people to become a depressive person. If the government does not solve this problem timely, there may be more severe consequences. \n To conclude, people who spend a long time at work may occur by the pursuit of living due to the high cost. In my opinion, this statement is a negative reform that may caused a serious effect on our long term life.","In the rephrased presentation, you should try to avoid making claims that are not included in the original prompt. For example, you cannot claim that working is a part of everyone's life these days. Everyone is too all encompassing from the children, the adults, and the elderly. The presentation is then making an exaggerated task claim that would make the representation of the statement partly incorrect. You need to make sure that the claims you make will be supported by the original statement. You could have instead said that working is something that all adults have to do. You should not be calling this a reform either. Reform means to alter something. In this case, there is no alteration. Rather is is a negative development, as it is a practice that has developed over time. \n Do not say ""First of all"" if there is no second or third reference in the succeeding presentations. Simply state the topic sentence and move on with the justified discussion presentation. In the second paragraph, you are making a claim about the government. You are offering an opinion about an action the government should take. That is a prompt deviation. You were not being asked what the government should do in the original question set so you should not be presenting a solution or comment where none is required. \n You should not be presenting an opinion in the concluding paragraph. If you wanted to present a first person opinion, you should have integrated it into your previous reasoning paragraphs. The concluding paragraph is only always used as the summarized presentation of your discussion points. You cannot continue the discussion in that section as you end up with an open ended essay presentation. \n By the way, a quick check of your errors shows that you have several errors in the grammar and Coherence sections of your presentation. Remember to edit your work before considering it final in form. The lack of editing on your part resulted in avoidable errors, if you had proof read your paper first.","The essay addresses the topic of work and its impacts, particularly focusing on financial burdens and the negative consequences of prolonged work hours. Here are some points for improvement:

1. **Topic Response:** The essay attempts to discuss the negative development of long work hours due to financial needs. However, it's essential to avoid overly broad claims not supported by the original prompt. For instance, suggesting ""working is part of everyone's life nowadays"" could be misrepresentative, as it doesn't account for various demographics such as children, retirees, etc. It's more accurate to specify that working concerns all adults or those in the workforce.

2. **Claims and Arguments:** The term ""reform"" is incorrectly used to describe the situation. Reform implies an intentional change or improvement, which seems out of place when discussing the necessity of working long hours. Instead, discussing these challenges as a ""negative development"" might be more fitting. Always ensure your claims are accurately phrased and backed up by evidence or clear logical reasoning.

3. **Structure and Clarity:** Avoid stating ""First of all"" if you do not plan to enumerate points (as ""secondly"", ""thirdly"", etc.). If there's only one main point or argument, simply present it without suggesting a list will follow. The essay structure should guide the reader smoothly through your points, without jarring jumps or incomplete lists.

4. **Focus and Relevance:** Be cautious of diverging from the prompt. The discussion on the government's role might stray from the essay's original focus. Stick closely to the guidelines and questions posed by the prompt to keep your essay on track.

5. **Opinions and Conclusion:** The presentation of personal opinions should be well-integrated into the body of your essay, supporting your arguments rather than appearing unexpectedly towards the end. The conclusion should summarize the main points discussed, without introducing new ideas or continuing the debate. This helps ensure the essay feels complete and well-rounded.

6. **Grammar and Style:** There are several grammatical and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, pay attention to verb tenses, coherence in sentences, and the correct use of articles (""the"", ""an"", ""a""). Misuse of these elements can obscure your meaning or make the essay harder to follow. Additionally, phrases like ""self suicide” are redundant, as ""suicide"" already implies self-harm; simply ""suicide"" is correct.

7. **Proofreading:** Always review your work before considering it final. Many grammatical errors and coherence issues can be easily fixed with careful proofreading. This step is crucial for ensuring your essay communicates your ideas clearly and professionally.

I will discuss these behaviours and give my opinion on this essay. \n People admit to a wonderful success of advertising because the quality of commercials is being in a higher level. In other words, consumers are being persuaded by high-quality advertisements rather than a real quality of goods for shopping. For example, on TV commercial breaks, watchers are easily attracted by contents and visual effects of those advertisements, which make people will splurge on those products. \n However, others disagree with this success because a range of ideas used for advertisements is more and more similar. Obviously, people will not pay attention to what an advertisement is showing if there is no difference on the content compared to others. This can lead to a sense of boredom due to the repetition. For example, when a commercial attracts many viewers, there will be numerous versions after that, which leads to a poor attraction of the advertising on some people. \n In my opinion, the advertising is still powerful in attracting shoppers because they are more and more amusing. They are not only normal advertisements which advertises products, but also tools to convey a source of inspiration and meaningful stories to watchers. For instance, some advertisers call for a protection on our environment on their advertisements, as a way to persuade the public buying the products. \n In conclusion, while some people disclam an influence of advertising due to its repetition, others and I believe that an advertising industry is in the successful period through its attraction.","You did very good work on this essay.

This approach is key as it demonstrates your ability to engage critically with the topic, a skill highly valued in English proficiency tests. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of your essay:

1. **Topic Responsiveness**: You've effectively tackled the topic by presenting both perspectives concerning the success of advertising and adding your viewpoint. It's good practice to ensure all parts of the question are answered as you have.

2. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammar and spelling issues (""apealing"" should be ""appealing"", ""disclam"" should be ""disclaim"", ""an advertising industry is in the successful period"" could be better phrased as ""the advertising industry is enjoying a period of success"") which, once corrected, could significantly polish your essay. Using simpler, clearer sentences could also help make your arguments more persuasive. For instance, instead of ""People admit to a wonderful success of advertising because the quality of commercials is being in a higher level"", consider ""People recognize the success of advertising due to the high quality of commercials"". 

3. **Clarity of Viewpoint**: Your point of view is evident, especially when you express personal opinion towards the end. However, to strengthen this, make sure your opinion is not only presented at the end but also subtly woven through the arguments you choose to support.

4. **Arguments and Evidence**: You’ve presented examples to support both views on advertising. To enhance your argument, it would help to expand on these examples with additional sentences that solidify your reasoning. For example, after introducing an example, add a sentence explaining why this example is particularly persuasive or significant. This technique convinces readers of the validity of your points.

5. **Paragraph Structure**: Aim for a minimum of three sentences per paragraph to fully develop your ideas. This structure allows you to introduce a point, explain or provide an example, and then elaborate on its importance or impact.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","free education will have a negative consequences \n Many people argue that universities are available to everyone from all walks of life. While I believe that higher education is a human right, I disagree that governments should offer a free university education to all people. \n On the one hand, higher education will bring a lot of advantages to the young. Firstly, going to universities or colleges is a huge opportunity to learn and build a solid knowledge base. This will be useful and practical for those who want to become teachers or pursue a postgraduate degree. Secondly, universities give students an open environment to develop essential skills for the future. For example, they can make friends with other students coming from other countries, exchange languages, and learn about different cultures. As a result, their communication skills will be better, and they also have a deeper understanding of the world around them. \n However, I disagree with the idea that universities should be free to everyone. In Vietnam, if the government provided free university education, this would lead to low quality of education. When a student doesn't have to pay free tuition fees, he can consider learning as a hobby and show a lack of commitment. Meanwhile, people who are forced to pay for their education will attempt to achieve good results at universities because it's their investment for future. Furthermore, there are many other sectors which need the support of government funds. When tuition fees are shared, governments have extra money to provide for health care, environment, and public transportation. \n In conclusion, everyone has the right to access universities or colleges. However, I believe that free education is not affordable because this will have a negative effect on students, governments, and the whole society.","you did not accurately paraphrase your prompt topic and discussion instruction. So you will lose TA points for that. This is an extent essay and yet you did not reveal an extent in your discussion presentation. You turned this into a comparative essay when it is a single opinion essay. However, if you used the correct paraphrasing of the discussion instruction, you would have been able to continue using this comparative discussion for the essay. The proper prompt requirement, based upon your existing discussion is: \n <em>University education is a right according to some people. That is why the government should shoulder educational expenses for all students, even if that student happens to be from a wealthy family. I partially agree with this statement for a number of reasons.</em> \n While I realize that Vietnam is the most obvious reference point for examples for you, it should not be used as the example in IELTS essays. In fact, no specific country should be used in reference to examples in a discussion unless it is absolutely necessary or applicable to do so. That is because the examiner will not be a Vietnamese so he will not be conscious of the educational travails of the country. This renders your example weak. Relying in common information instead and examples that apply to any country is always the best way to go so that the reviewer doesn't need specialized knowledge when reading and assessing your essay.","This essay addresses the topic of whether higher education should be freely provided by the government. However, the response does not closely align with the prompt's requirements, which impacts the essay's effectiveness in discussing the issue at hand. It’s important to closely follow the instructions and properly rephrase the prompt to ensure clarity in your argument.

Starting with the positive aspects, the essay presents some well-argued points regarding the benefits and drawbacks of free higher education. The arguments about the advantages of accessing universities for personal and professional development are clear and effectively outlined. Also, the concerns regarding the potential decrease in education quality and the financial burden on the government if education were made free are valid and well-presented.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved to strengthen the essay:

1. **Clarity in Responding to the Prompt**: The essay began as if it were to discuss the consequences of free education broadly but seemed to lean towards comparing the benefits and drawbacks without clearly indicating the extent of agreement or disagreement with the statement. Making your position clear from the start will guide the reader through your arguments more effectively.
   
2. **Use of Examples**: While using Vietnam as an example might seem relevant to you personally, it's important to choose examples that can be understood and appreciated globally, ensuring the essay resonates with a wider audience. Try to use more universal examples or explain specific ones in a way that anyone can understand their significance.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors in the essay, such as the incorrect use of ""free tuition fees"" instead of ""tuition-free education"" and some instances of awkward phrasing. Also, the term ""negative consequences"" in the title should be ""negative consequences,"" ensuring proper agreement. Paying attention to these details will significantly improve the readability and professionalism of your writing.

4. **Position and Argument Clarity**: Though it’s evident you are against free university education for all, your argument would benefit from a stronger and clearer presentation of your stance. Instead of only providing comparative scenarios, delving deeper into the implications of your viewpoint would offer a more compelling argument.

In conclusion, refining the response to the prompt, selecting universally relevant examples, addressing minor grammatical issues, and clarifying your arguments can substantially elevate your essay. These adjustments will make your writing more persuasive and aligned with the expectations of English proficiency tests.

4379,https://essayforum.com/writing/advantages-disadvantages-keeping-animals-zoos-86904/,test,Some experts believe it is better for animals to live in zoos where they are safe and are given all the food they need \n Do you think that living in zoos has more advantages or more disadvantages for animals?,"We have been keeping animals in zoos for a very long time. It is believed that because zoos can provide safety and food to animals, it is better for them to live there. However, there are several points we should take account of when doing this. \n The advantages of the zoos are obvious. When staying in the zoos, the animals are safe from predators, harsh environment conditions, and are provided with enough and proper food and care. For animals that are rare or in danger of extinction, this is also a crucial part of action to an effort of conservation and protection. As they can lead peaceful life without worrying about anything, we can help them gradually raise their number again. Therefore, zoos play an essential part of taking after animal activities. \n Nevertheless, for the animals kept in zoos, there are also some drawbacks. They can easily lose their natural habits and instincts when separated from their natural habitat for too long, so it's difficult for it to return to wildlife. For example, a lion born and growing up in zoo environment couldn't know how to hunt preys and live out of the zoo. Moreover, the conditions and facilities of some of the zoos, such as some ones in Vietnam, are not really well preserved and developed, on top of that, the hot and humid weather of Vietnam might make a huge difficulty for them, so the animals may not be taken after well enough and be in good state. Thus, for the sake of animal, it is best that we should be mindful of these factors and attempt to build their living space to be as near to their natural habitat as possible. \n Based on the points given above, although zoos protect animals in captivity and contribute to the conservation, we also have to pay attentions to the states of the zoos to create suitable environment for animals' overall development. In my view, the advantages are equal to the disadvantages.","The clear question is, do you believe that there are more advantages or disadvantages? This means you have to use an advanced discussion format to respond to this topic. For starters, you have to clearly indicate whether you see this as an advantage or disadvantage in the prompt paraphrase from there, the advanced discussion format kicks in. \n What is the advanced discussion format? After having chosen a side to defend in the reasoning paragraphs, the 2 reasoning paragraphs should be able to hold a complete and properly developed discussion as follows: \n - Present a topic sentence signifying an advantage or disadvantage as seen from a public perspective; \n - Explain why this is considered an advantage; \n - Present your opinion of this reasoning (advantage or disadvantage) \n - Use an example to prove your point \n - Add an explanation to help reiterate your opinion \n To that twice for this essay so that you can clearly represent a properly developed discussion focusing on 2 advantages and disadvantages points that will help support your opinion. I did not see that happening in this essay at all. In fact, you failed to present your personal opinion throughout the given discussion paragraphs. I should not need to point out the reasons why your concluding paragraph is also incorrect right? I already pointed that out in one of your previous essay critiques.","This essay addresses the topic of keeping animals in zoos, discussing both the advantages and disadvantages of this practice. However, to enhance the essay and fully respond to the prompt, it's crucial to adopt a more structured discussion format and clearly articulate a personal stance on the issue. Below are several areas for improvement and suggestions on how to strengthen the essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to balance the advantages and disadvantages of zoos. However, the task requires taking a clear position. It's important to state explicitly whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages or vice versa. This will guide the overall structure and arguments of the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are minor errors and awkward phrases present in the essay. For instance, ""taking account of"" could be simplified to ""considering,"" and ""taking after animal activities"" might be better expressed as ""caring for animals."" Ensuring correct grammar and smoother transitions between sentences will improve readability and coherence.

3. **Clarity of the Point of View:** The essay concludes by stating that the advantages and disadvantages are equal, which is ambiguous. A compelling essay should present a clear viewpoint. Decide whether you believe the benefits of zoos outweigh the drawbacks or not, and use this perspective to shape your arguments.

4. **Argument Structure:** The essay lacks a structured approach to presenting arguments. To make your essay more persuasive, follow the advanced discussion format mentioned:
   - Start with a topic sentence that clearly states an advantage or disadvantage.
   - Explain why this point is considered a benefit or drawback.
   - Share your personal opinion on this argument.
   - Provide a specific example to support your view.
   - Conclude with a sentence that reinforces your stance.
   
   Apply this structure to at least two advantages and two disadvantages, ensuring your personal opinion is evident throughout.

5. **Use of Examples:** While the essay mentions examples (e.g., lions in zoos), these examples need to be linked more directly to the argument and followed by an explanation that reinforces your opinion. This will make your arguments more convincing.

6. **Conclusion:** The concluding paragraph should summarize the key points made and reaffirm your position. As it stands, the conclusion is vague and does not effectively encapsulate the discussion or the author's stance.

To improve the essay, consider these points:
- Begin by stating your viewpoint clearly in the introduction.
- Use the advanced discussion format to construct your arguments.
- Avoid ambiguity in your opinion and conclusion.
- Work on sentence structure and grammar to enhance clarity and flow.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? \n What other measures do you think might be effective?,"It is assumed by raising the price of petrol would result in solving the growing issue of emission and traffic. In this case, I would argue that although petrol price is increased, it would not lead to tackling these problems. Instead, it would cause other problems such as the increasing cost of staple food and other public transportation. Other solutions, such as introducing the law to use public transportations and stopping illegal logging, should be taken into consideration. \n Those who believe by increasing the price of petrol would terminate the problem of pollution and traffic are because they thought there would be a decrease in the use of private cars due to high price of fuel. If the fuel price is higher, then people do not want to use their cars and use public transportation instead. \n In fact, an increase in petrol price will bring domino effects to other sectors, such as public transportation and the price of staple food in market. Taking Indonesia as an example, there was a raise in fuel in 2008, and it was followed by the increasing price of chili, onion, and meat in traditional market. In addition, the price of tickets for using public transportation also went up and people kept driving their cars on roads so that traffic and pollution issues still happen nowadays. \n The examples that have been mentioned are tangible proof that increasing the price of petrol is not the best solution and other measures are needed. I believe in order to prevent emission and traffic problems, promoting the law to use public transportation and ceasing illegal logging problems will solve these issues. This is because if government changes the law, many people will switch to use public transportation instead of their private cars. The reinforcement law in illegal logging also makes illegal loggers think twice if they want to cut down the trees so that traffic and pollution issues can be handled. \n To sum up, a raise in petrol will not solve the growing problem of traffic and pollution. In fact, it only creates new problems, so that other measures such as promoting law to use public transportation and stopping illegal logging would be more effective.","Dear student, you could possibly score a 6 on the scoring band with this essay. As I read the essay, I came to realize that you not only understood the prompt provided, but you also bothered to analyze the question in reference to possible solutions that you could provide. Therefore, it became evident that the person writing the essay has a somewhat advanced knowledge of the language. The person also has the ability to develop cohesive sentences, even though there may be problems with his word choices throughout the essay. These mistakes do not impede the discussion that you are presenting. Therefore, you have a very good chance of passing this particular section of the IELTS test. Try to focus more on developing your English vocabulary and practice developing simple sentences for your use in the practice tests. We need to show that your language use can increase to a point where you can score even higher in the practice tests which can translate to a higher rating in the actual test.","The essay provides a well-thought-out argument against increasing petrol prices as a solution to the issues of traffic and pollution. It's clear from the essay that there is an understanding of the topic and a close connection with potential solutions that do not solely rely on raising petrol costs. This demonstrates a good grasp of language and an ability to develop cohesive arguments.

In terms of strengths, the essay successfully addresses the topic and presents a clear point of view. Arguments are supported with relevant examples, such as the situation in Indonesia in 2008, which helps in making the case more convincing. This use of specific instances as evidence of broader points is a strong strategy.

However, there are areas that require improvement:

1. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Even though these errors do not distract significantly from the content, refining word choices and sentence structure can enhance clarity and readability. Practicing simple sentence construction and expanding vocabulary can aid in this.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion**: While the essay discusses the main arguments logically, more attention to transitions between ideas could make the essay flow better. Phrases that link sentences and paragraphs will make the essay more coherent.

3. **Depth of Argumentation**: Although the essay introduces an alternative perspective to solving traffic and pollution problems, deeper analysis of these alternatives could strengthen the argument. Exploring how and why these measures could be more effective might provide a more compelling case.

4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion summarizes the essay’s main points well but could be more impactful by briefly reiterating the importance of finding viable solutions to the discussed issues.

In summary, focusing on expanding vocabulary, refining sentence structures, and improving the depth of analysis will contribute to a higher level of proficiency in writing. Regular practice, especially in developing simple yet effective sentences, will be beneficial.

In my own opinion, having museums that are free of charge always comes with a lot of benefits. \n Firstly, museums always play an important role in not only managing the collections but also educating people, especially the young students, who can hardly afford the tickets. As an art student myself, there has always been mesmerizing experiences for me to visit museums where I got inspiration and motivation. It would be a heavy burden to go to museums with admission charge every week, for many students just like me. \n Furthermore, free museums may seem much more accessible to the public when many people still don't have the habits to visit art exhibits regularly and don't know why they should pay for them. Unless the museum is known by everyone and praised everywhere, charging from people would greatly reduce its attractiveness to most of the public, and thus making itself harder to survive without support from the society. \n Someone may argue that the funds from visitors are important for museums to obtain and maintain. However, the problem could be more easily solved by demanding more financial help from charities and the governments. In conclusion, there are much more advantages than disadvantages, for both the public and the museums, to have free admission for visiting.","Dear student, your paraphrasing of the prompt requirements is misrepresenting the original intent of the writer and also, incomplete in presentation.

There may be debates but not controversies. It is important that you reflect the original sentiment and intent of the writer.

Take for example the method by which I paraphrased this prompt: \n <em>There are a number of museums that charge admission fees from its visitors. Then there are some museums that allow ""free of charge"" admission to those that wish to see their exhibits. Some people believe that there are advantages to the charging of museum entrance fees and that these negate the disadvantages it may pose to the visitors. In this essay, I will discuss whether charging admission fees have more advantages than disadvantages for the museum itself and its visitors.</em> \n Notice the sense of analysis regarding the instructions and topic for discussion?

However, there are a few areas that require improvement to ensure your essay fully addresses the task and showcases your English proficiency.

1. **Addressing the Essay Topic Accurately:**
Your introduction attempts to frame the discussion but falls short of accurately capturing the essence of the debate. Instead of suggesting a ""controversy,"" it would be more appropriate to present this as a matter of differing opinions or approaches among museums and individuals. A more accurate paraphrasing of the topic, without changing its original meaning, will set a solid foundation for your essay. It's essential to show you understand the topic by presenting it without sensationalizing or altering its intent.

2. **Structural Completeness:**
Your essay is currently missing a concluding paragraph, which is crucial for wrapping up your arguments and reinforcing your stance. A strong conclusion would not only summarize your key points but also reiterate the benefits of free museum admission you've discussed. Make sure your essay includes an introduction, body paragraphs that support your argument, and a conclusion for a complete and cohesive response.

3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Stylistic Issues:**
While your essay is largely understandable, there are minor grammatical errors that could detract from its overall clarity and professionalism. Pay attention to sentence structure and verb tense consistency. For example, consider revising phrases like ""it is controversial that whether museums should be freely open to the public"" to ""There is debate over whether museums should be open to the public for free."" Such revisions will enhance the readability and accuracy of your expression.

4. **Clarity of Point of View:**
Your point of view is evident throughout the essay, and you make valid arguments in support of free museum admission. However, enhancing the precision of your language and avoiding generalizations will strengthen your position. Specific examples and clearer, more direct statements of opinion will make your viewpoint more compelling.

5. **Supporting Arguments:**
You've provided clear reasons why free museum admission is advantageous, touching on accessibility and educational benefits. To further improve, consider expanding your arguments with more detailed examples or evidence, and address potential counterarguments more thoroughly to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

In my opinion, the government could do much more to improve the quality of life for all urban dwellers. \n One of the main problems that city inhabitants have to deal with is the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in small villages or the countryside areas. They have to pay the higher cost for housing, transport, and even food. This will ultimately cause pressure on the shoulder for inhabitants who don't have a lucrative income. Another issue is that traffic congestion during rush hour. Increasing unproductive travel time not only causes stress but also decreases work productivity. City commuters often have to spend at least 30 minutes and even hours sitting in traffic on their way to and from work. \n However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could finance money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, it is necessary to improve public transport to make it more attractive to people. The problem of traffic would be effectively addressed if more people decided to use public transport instead of their private vehicles.

However, there are some areas that could be enhanced to make the argument stronger and more coherent.

1. **Adherence to Topic**: The essay responds to the topic by discussing the drawbacks of city living and proposing solutions. However, it would benefit from a clearer introduction that directly addresses the question without stating personal opinion unless specifically asked for. Ensuring the essay directly answers the question or task from the beginning can make your argument more focused.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is generally well-written but has minor errors that disrupt the flow. For example, ""cost of living is likely to be much higher"" could be more concise, e.g., ""the cost of living is higher."" Additionally, ""finance money in the building"" could be simplified to ""invest in building."" Improving sentence structure will make the essay easier to read and understand.

3. **Clarity of Argument**: The point of view is mostly clear but could be further clarified by avoiding deviations from the main argument. Stay focused on providing examples and solutions related to the topic. Avoid inserting opinions unless the question explicitly asks for it.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Transition**: The essay lacks transition sentences, making it hard to see the connection between paragraphs and ideas. Using transition phrases such as ""Another aspect to consider is..."" or ""In addition to the high cost of living,..."" can help guide the reader through your arguments smoothly.

For the solutions section, it's important to offer detailed explanations and examples. For instance, when suggesting the government invest in public transport, explain how this would make it more attractive and reduce traffic. For example, ""Investing in public transport, like expanding subway lines or increasing bus frequency, can make it a more convenient option, possibly reducing the reliance on private cars.""

I don't bother taking a few steps away from the train tracks, but just stand there and look at the train slowly crawl away. With the increasing speed, a force, at least we learned this at school, pulls the air with it, which makes my hair fly all around. I take a deep breath and close my eyes to the sounds of all the noise around me. I haven't been here for what feels like forever, though I've only spent a couple of days at my father's. As I open my eyes the train has already gone out of sight. \n That's when my mum parks her car in the parking right next to me. She gets out of her car half waving with both arms, as if I hadn't seen her. I smile and wave back, while dragging my luggage behind me in her direction. "" How are you So? Tell me all about it!"", she says as I put my stuff in the backseats. "" Ehm, I guess I'm fine? I'm just fed up about this situation. I mean I've got better things to do than travel every second weekend around the country."", I grumble. "" Yeah I know my darling, I'm sorry, but you know there are some things in the world you can't change, and that for example is one of those unchangeable things. Then she gives me a gentle kiss on my forehead and enters the car. So do I without losing another word about my dad. Instead we put on some music and talk about what plans we want to make for the following days to come, since I've still got holidays for two more weeks. "" How about a movie night tonight?"", my mum suggests, by which I totally agree and turn the music louder, until we can't even hear ourselves sing anymore. \n Those moments, I guess, I'll miss the most one day, when I'm separated from her, because someone has left the other, be it on purpose or not. At exactly those moments the time almost stands still and I feel everything up to my bones, every feeling swinging and swirling inside my body. And there are many of those moments. Like for instance one happy memory I have with my mum, is the day she taught me how to ice skate. Herself she couldn't really ice skate, but she did her best to make it the best day of my life. Or all those bed time stories she told me as I was a kid. Everything she put aside to give me the life I now have. \n A tear rolls down my cheek. I quickly wipe it away before my mum notices anything. \n ...","Dear student, you have to give me something to work with here. Did you write this for creative writing class? I have to tell you that as an narrative based on your personal experience, I believe that you did a good job for most of the essay. It was engaging, imaginative, and took the reader on the ride with your mom and you in that car. Everything was going great until the last paragraph when you suddenly bring in the story about going ice skating with your mom. It came for out of the blue and did not really have a chance to develop in relation to the previous story because you suddenly cut it short. Why was that? Are you planning on developing that story further? I think the story doesn't really have a proper ending at the moment so you should work on creating a memorable conclusion to it.","Your essay paints a vivid picture of a moment shared between you and your mother, successfully engaging the reader with your narrative and emotions. You do a commendable job at creating an engaging atmosphere and bringing the reader along for the journey, particularly with the detailed description of your surroundings and the interaction between you and your mother. However, there are a few areas where improvement would enhance your essay and better convey your message.

1. The essay seems to be a reflective piece on the bond between you and your mother, yet it lacks a direct response to a particular topic question. If the essay is intended for a specific prompt, revisiting that prompt to ensure the essay's alignment would be beneficial. If it is a general narrative, then consider framing it around a clear theme or message about your relationship with your mother.
   
2. While your essay is mostly clear and easy to follow, there are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, be careful with punctuation and the use of apostrophes in contractions (e.g., ""mum's car"" is correctly used, but be mindful of similar instances). Also, maintaining a consistent tense throughout your narrative can help improve clarity and flow.

3. Your point of view is somewhat clear as you narrate the story from a personal and introspective angle. However, strengthening your perspective with more direct statements about your feelings and reflections could make your essay more compelling. For example, instead of simply describing events, delve deeper into how these events made you feel and why they are significant to you.

4. The argument or the main point of your essay seems to revolve around cherishing moments with loved ones, yet the development of this theme is abrupt, especially with the sudden shift to the ice skating memory in the last paragraph. This story seems out of place as it is not fully integrated into the narrative or conclusively linked to the rest of the essay. Extending this memory to construct a more cohesive link to the overall theme or choosing to focus on the current narrative without diverging would create a stronger, more unified argument.

To improve, consider revisiting the purpose of your essay: whether it's to reflect on your relationship with your mother, the challenge of being away from her, or another theme entirely. Flesh out this theme with more detail, ensuring all parts of your narrative support this central idea. Crafting a clear, impactful conclusion that ties back to the main theme would also give your essay a more polished, memorable end.

By addressing these areas, you will strengthen both the clarity and impact of your essay, making it not only a reflection of your personal experiences but also a compelling narrative that resonates with the reader.",3,4,4,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,Narrative

Agree or disagree.,"It is true that prison is a general solution of dealing with crime. However, some people believe that the more effective way is to provide better education for citizens. I disagree with this opinion. \n On the one side, it is obvious that prison is such an effective way to cope with crime as a whole. Firstly, a policy of zero tolerance definitely \n helps to deter a large numbers of criminals with tough punishment. For example, in some countries, murderers have to serve a long prison sentence or even be sentenced to capital punishment which would raise people‟s awareness of serious consequence of committing crime. Secondly, offenders who are in prison do not have ability to harm the society. As a result, innocent people will feel more safer, and can completely concentrate on their work. \n On the other side, education is also a factor contributing to the effort of reducing crime. Students who have full perception of legislation are not prone to fall fouls of the law. For example youngsters who participate in some course of driving laws in school would understand the importance of safety in driving more thoroughly. Furthermore, education in prison is an alternative/ effective way to help criminal reintegrate back into society after serving prison sentences. They, therefore, will be given a chance of rehabilitation to embark on something fresh, and avoid the risk of making mistakes again in the future. \n In conclusion, I disagree that education is better than prison in solving the problem of crime. However, both solutions have their own advantages and they are equally important.","Since this is a simple agree or disagree essay, you should not use the comparison format for the discussion. The only side that must be discussed here is your disagreement. You have to use 2 related reasons for your disagreement. The 2 related reasons should be presented within 2 separate paragraphs. That means, you use one topic per paragraph. Each paragraph must be fully explained and supported by an example in order to be considered clear and fully developed by the examiner. \n Your essay conclusion is incorrect as you offered a restatement of the prompt and your opinion, but then inserted a reference to an advantage comparative discussion which altered your response. Your answer now went from a disagreement to a comparative discussion that indicated the importance of both discussion responses (Agree / Disagree). The concluding paragraph should have instead, just repeated the topic sentence, your opinion, and your 2 related reasons. \n Your essay cannot receive a passing score when your overall presentation tends to present a confusing opinion. If you cannot present a solid opinion and offer supporting information for it, then the examiner will score you based on the fact that you do not have a clear opinion presented.","The essay provided offers an exploration of whether education or imprisonment is more effective in addressing crime. The essay attempts to argue against the superiority of education over imprisonment but falls short of maintaining a clear stance throughout, leading to some confusion regarding the essay's main argument. In the aim to refine this essay, several points require attention:

1. **Topic Response**: The essay is constructed in a comparison format, discussing both the merits of prison and education in dealing with crime. However, the task requires choosing a position and arguing in favor of it. Thus, to remain focused and relevant to the prompt, the essay should concentrate solely on substantiating why prison is seen as the superior solution, according to the stated disagreement with the alternative view.

2. **Stylistic Considerations**: The structure of the essay dilutes its focus by addressing both sides of the argument equally. To enhance clarity, it's advisable to organize the essay into separate paragraphs, each dedicated to a distinct reason supporting the disagreement with education being more effective than prison. This structure allows for a more in-depth exploration of each point and minimizes confusion regarding the author's stance.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of apostrophes and some awkward phrasing (“feel more safer,”). Simplifying sentences and running the text through a grammar check could easily remedy these issues, improving overall readability.

4. **Clarity of Position**: The conclusion introduces ambiguity by suggesting both prison and education hold equal importance in addressing crime, despite the initial disagreement with this stance. For higher coherence and to meet the essay's requirements, the concluding paragraph should reiterate the author's disagreement with the proposed solution (education), briefly summarizing the arguments made against it.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: While the essay includes examples, these need to be tied directly to clear, individual arguments within their own paragraphs to strengthen the essay's structure and persuasive power. Each supporting reason for the disagreement should be expanded upon with specific details and examples, following the format of introducing a claim, supporting it with evidence or example, and concluding the paragraph by linking back to the main argument.

By revising the essay with these points in mind—emphasizing a clear, singular stance, refining the structure, and addressing stylistic errors—a more coherent and compelling argument can emerge. This will not only align the essay more closely with the prompt but also create a more persuasive and well-supported discussion.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4385,https://essayforum.com/writing/cosmetic-surgery-96018/,test,An increasing number of people are choosing to have cosmetic surgery in order to improve their appearance. Why do people have operations to change the way they look? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In recent years, the number of people opting for plastic surgery to alter their look has been dramatically growing. There are two main reasons behind this phenomenon including fostering self-confidence and having more career opportunities. However, I am utterly convinced that it is a negative trend. This essay will discuss my view as follows. \n To commence with, the chief reason behind this issue is that numerous individuals want to boost their confidence through cosmetic operations. This is because people are often born with imperfect features that do not meet beauty standards in general; these features can reduce their self-esteem. As a result, they may want to upgrade their look and fix some of their imperfections through surgeries such as a nose job and lip job to become more confident about their look. The second reason is that having a good appearance can help people have more job opportunities. It can not be denied that having a better appearance can leave a better impression on employers which may increase the chance of getting recruited for the job. According to a recent survey in the USA, approximately 80% of employers said that a candidate with a good appearance and professional look is more likely to pass the interview because they look more trustworthy. \n Despite the potential benefits it can bring about, I strongly believe that it is a negative trend due to the physical and psychological health risks. Regarding the former, going through cosmetic operations can carry a number of risks such as infection and post-operative complications. Therefore, patients' physical health can be affected badly in the long term and even have a high risk of death if the operations fail. Research in this field has shown that currently in VietNam, more than 30% of patients with breast augmentation have suffered from infection after the operation. Moreover, the patient's mental health can also deteriorate. Because beauty standards constantly change so after the operation, people may feel what they fixed is not up to that standard which may lead to depression. A survey in the medical field showed that 65% of Korean women who had nose surgery 5 years ago are dissatisfied with it and feel depressed now which contributed to their mental health issues. \n In conclusion, the reasons that triggered this trend are boosting self-confidence and gaining more job opportunities. From my point of view, this is a negative development because of the physical and psychological risks it brings.","<quotation>This essay will discuss my view as follows.</quotation> \n There is no need to say this. You already established the discussion parameters within the prompt restatement and quite well developed writer's opinion and thesis statement.

A reminder though, the concluding summary should have a total of 40 words in it to qualify for full scoring credit. You did not reach that magic number. You can write more, but not less than that word count in that paragraph.","Your essay effectively addresses the topic by exploring the reasons behind the increase in plastic surgery and presenting a clear stance against it. Your arguments are well-constructed, focusing on how these surgeries are sought for boosting self-confidence and enhancing career opportunities, and the counterarguments regarding the risks involved are compelling. You've demonstrated a solid ability to organize your thoughts and present them in a structured manner.

However, there's a portion in your introduction that suggests what you will discuss next, which is unnecessary since you've already outlined your essay's direction. Eliminating such redundant phrases can make your writing more concise and impactful.

In terms of language use, your essay showcases a good command of English with a diverse vocabulary and generally correct sentence structure. This indicates that your language skills are quite strong, which is a positive aspect for any English proficiency test. 

Yet, your conclusion could be improved by extending its length to meet specific word count requirements that some tests may have. Expanding your concluding paragraph could offer more depth to your summary and restatement of your main points and personal stance, ensuring you don't miss out on potential points.

A small note on grammar and style: your essay is mostly well-written but watch out for minor errors and ensure your arguments flow logically from one to the next. For instance, maintaining consistent tense and being cautious of article usage (the/a/an) can polish your writing further.

Another area for improvement is the specificity of your examples and evidence. While you've included statistics from surveys, grounding these with sources or more context can strengthen your argument, making it more persuasive. 

Lastly, considering the psychological and physical impacts of plastic surgery, you've touched on critical consequences. Deepening your exploration here with more detailed examples or expert opinions could enhance the persuasiveness of your arguments.

Overall, your essay is on the right track, displaying clear reasoning and a good grasp of English. With slight modifications to structure, expansion in certain areas, and refinement in language use, your writing will become even more effective and engaging.",4,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

Despite certain drawbacks, there are plenty of beneficial applications of this modern technique. \n Apparently, if people overuse this high technology, they will be struggling with harmful effects. Firstly, humans are slowly obsessed with virtual friendships and consequently leave behind their real interactions. For instance, in some families, most of the time in a day adults and children contact each other through the internet, gradually lose the relationship between family members. Secondly, the advanced technology is making humans become weaker. By sitting a long time in front of a computer's screen,residents take high risks to get health problems, including spinal diseases and eye disorders. \n In contrast, information technology brings better methods to people for resolving their daily demands. In the home field, the technology supports parents to keep updated about their children's status and provide more exact decisions on time.

Here are some points to guide you in refining your essay:

1. **Response to Topic:** You have effectively addressed the topic, discussing the dual aspects of information technology's influence. Maintaining focus on this dual perspective throughout your essay strengthens your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Pay close attention to spelling and grammar. Errors can distract readers and impact the clarity of your message. For instance, watch out for plural-singular agreement (""houseworks"" should be ""housework"") and missing articles (""the internet,"" ""a computer's screen""). Also, ensure sentences are not too long and complex, as this can make them difficult to follow. Breaking down complex thoughts into simpler, more concise sentences can enhance readability.

3. **Clear Point of View:** You have clearly articulated your viewpoint, acknowledging both the positive and negative sides of information technology. However, refining your arguments to be more focused would make your stance even stronger.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You've offered several points in support of your view, but the essay would benefit from deeper exploration of fewer points rather than briefly mentioning many. Choose your strongest arguments and spend more time elaborating on each, using specific examples and explanations. This will make your essay more convincing and easier for readers to follow.

5. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion should summarize the key points made in your essay more effectively. Rather than introducing new information or making broad statements, recap your main arguments clearly and succinctly. This helps reinforce your message and provides a strong closing.

6. **Length and Focus:** Aim for a concise essay, ideally within the 275-290 word range. This limit encourages you to focus on the most compelling arguments and refine your points for clarity and impact.

IELTS writing task II about healthy life,"Nowadays, people tend to ignore the way of healthy life and both medical treatments and practitioners are used by them to manage their health. Personally, I agree with the former statement because nowadays people occupations are mostly worker which are very busy with their businesses and choose the easiest way for their daily life such as consume fast food and lack of exercise, so it is clearly that the dependency of people to the doctors and medicine is increase rather than following the way of healthy life. \n Focusing on the job is one of the crucial factors that causing people does not have much time to maintain their daily routines such as food consumption and less exercise and it becomes a new bad habit for them. Consuming fast food is chosen as the best alternative because the simplicity and they can consume anywhere and anytime while sitting for several hours to finish their job. Consequently, they suffer some serious illnesses such as diabetes because the accumulation of saturation fat on fast food and lack of exercise. \n To overcome the problems, doctors and medical treatments are the best solution for them to manage even cure their illnesses. What the common fact they do is hire nutritionists to maintain their food while they still lack of exercise. People also go to the doctor if they will suffer and get prescription to buy some medicine to make their body fit. \n Taking everything into consideration, albeit doctors and medical treatments help people who suffer illnesses and help them to maintain their lifestyle such as food and keep body health, avoid unhealthy lifestyle is the most important preventive action to cope up with health problems.","Dear student, your opening statement is confusing because you did not structure the first sentence coherently. You should have used the words ""in favor of"" when referring to the choice of people to go to doctors and take medicines instead of changing their lifestyle. Sometimes, all it takes is the correct phrase to clear up any confusion in a sentence. That is the case with your opening statement. If you set the opening sentence properly, then the confusion could have been easily avoided. Personally, I understood what you had to say in the successive paragraphs because, while there was a little stress in reading your paragraphs, you somehow got the message across to the reader. Like I said, it was only your opening statement that created the confusion. The rest of the essay really came very close to providing coherent and cohesive details of your opinion. This is not a bad first attempt at writing a Task 2 essay. Keep practicing and we will keep helping you improve your writing skills.","The essay addresses the topic by discussing how modern lifestyles lead to reliance on medical treatments instead of adopting a healthy way of living. The point of view that people prefer the convenience of medical interventions over preventive healthy practices is clear throughout your essay. You've done well to maintain a coherent argument that supports your view, particularly regarding the impact of busy lifestyles on health choices. 

However, there are areas where your essay can be improved:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The opening sentence is not structured clearly which might confuse readers about your primary argument. Try rephrasing it for clarity. For example, you could start with ""In today’s fast-paced world, many people prefer to visit doctors and use medical treatments instead of leading a healthy lifestyle."" This directly states your viewpoint and sets a clearer context for your argument.

2. **Grammar and Style**: There are several instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, ""nowadays people occupations are mostly worker"" could be more clearly expressed as ""nowadays, most people have jobs that keep them very busy."" Paying attention to subject-verb agreement and sentence structure will make your writing more fluid. Also, using the correct form of words, like ""increase"" should be ""increases"" to match the subject in your sentence.

3. **Supporting Arguments**: While you provide examples, like the consumption of fast food and lack of exercise, expanding on these with more detail or additional examples could strengthen your argument. Explaining not just the 'what' but the 'why' behind these choices can make your argument more compelling.

4. **Solutions and Conclusions**: You mention the role of doctors and medical treatments as solutions but don't fully explore how this connects back to the problem of ignoring healthy lifestyles. Clarifying that adopting preventive measures could be more beneficial than relying on medical solutions after problems have arisen will make your conclusion stronger and more persuasive.

By focusing on these aspects, your essay will become clearer, more grammatically accurate, and more effectively argue your point of view. Remember, practice is key to improvement.

4388,https://essayforum.com/writing/popularity-reading-news-online-means-crisis-80402/,test,"Although more and more people read news on the internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. \n To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays reading news via online is gaining popularity. Despite this, some argue newspapers will still be the most essential when it comes to news sources. I completely disagree with this view as I believe online news will be more important than newspapers. \n News websites and APPs are faster to report breaking news than newspapers. After writing a piece of news, correspondents only need to press a button to post it online, thanks to the instant nature of the Internet. Newspaper articles, on the other hand, would reach readers only after print and distribution, which could take a day. As a result, the public would rely more on the Internet for news, especially breaking ones. \n Apart from on speed, online news wins newspapers on diversity of media types. Newspapers present news with words and pictures; websites and APPs could utilize a wide range of media forms, including audios and videos. These visual and acoustic reports convey more information than photos and words. They are also able to leave a deeper impression on people's mind. For example, a video from BBC news presented sounds of gunshots and babies crying at the end of a report. The video demonstrated the cruelty of war and could help its audience relate to people in the conflict-torn area. Audios and videos that newspapers cannot present make online reports more impressive. \n In conclusion, the Internet would surpass newspapers in terms of importance, because online news is instant and includes more diverse media types.","Dear student, I am impressed with the improvement in your writing. You have shown a tremendous amount of growth with this essay presentation. You have been paying attention the advice being given to you and properly applying it. A word of caution though, you should never use sensationalist references in a task 2 essay unless a ""Debate"" is actually inferred. Rather, always use variations of the word ""discussion"" because that is what the essays normally represent. \n You should now learn to use transition sentences within 2 paragraphs that will help to connect 2 separate topics into one cohesive and coherent discussion. This is the only slight problem in your second paragraphs. After you said ""instant future of the internet"" the next reference sentence should have been a transition from online newspapers to traditional newspapers. A possible transition / connecting sentence would have been; ""This is where the difference between an online paper and a printed paper lies."" Then you could have continued with ""Newspaper articles..."" The transition sentence would have conneced the two different thoughts by presenting them in a connected meaning thus creating a more complex paragraph and showing off your ability to use various sentence and writing styles to improve your presentations. \n Don't worry about the acronyms for the news sources. You will be wasting time and word space if you define internationally known news sources. It isn't necessary. Your concluding paragraph did not properly summarize the discussion topic points though and that, would have been a waste of scoring potential on your part.","The essay responds directly to the topic, asserting that online news will be more important than newspapers. This clear standpoint is well-argued throughout the essay with two main points: the immediacy of online news and the diverse media formats it offers beyond text and images, like audio and video. These strengths are significant as they showcase an understanding of the essay topic and an ability to construct a logical argument.

However, there are areas for improvement to make the essay even stronger. Firstly, while the use of ""news websites and APPs"" is understandable, it's important to maintain a formal tone throughout the essay. Consider using ""applications"" instead of ""APPs"" to elevate the essay's formality.

The transition between paragraphs could be smoother. After highlighting the speed of online news, introducing a connecting sentence could better bridge the gap to the next paragraph, which discusses the diversity of media types. For example, after mentioning the instant nature of online news, a sentence like ""This immediacy is complemented by the variety of ways information can be presented online"" would create a more cohesive flow between the paragraphs.

Regarding the content, referencing sensational elements, such as ""sounds of gunshots and babies crying,"" should be approached with caution. In an academic or formal essay, it's better to stick to neutral descriptions and avoid potentially sensationalist content unless the essay topic specifically calls for a debate or discussion on such matters.

Lastly, the conclusion could be more robust. While it reiterates the main argument, summarizing the discussion points more thoroughly would strengthen the final paragraph. Restating how the immediacy and multimedia capabilities of online news make it superior to traditional newspapers, without introducing new ideas, would provide a more effective closure.

Improving these aspects of the essay—maintaining a formal tone, smoothing transitions between paragraphs, cautiously selecting content, and enhancing the conclusion—will not only address the task more effectively but will also demonstrate a higher level of writing proficiency.

This has been discussed for many years. It is still a controversial issue between high school students and different college students. \n Some people support history or other social science subjects are important because it is related to humans and society. People can learn from the back, at the same time, history cultivates people's humanity. Usually, studying in the field, the students' personalities are sensitive and careful. Nonetheless, some people insist that science and technology are the current trends. Students studying science and technology might have promise future and better income. Those students' traits include carelessness and straightforward. They equip better mathematics ability to solve the complicated questions but they are not good at interacting with others and often think not thoroughly. \n From my own perspective, I consider that both field are crucial to society or the whole human being. I was a student in the social science group. When I entered university, sometimes, I met some students who majored in the engineering department discriminate against us. They felt that our college didn't have any contribution. At that time, I was mad because they never noticed that in every moment, their behaviors and even speech were closed to our study field. I must admit that in Taiwan, studying science is easy to apply for a high-income position. Companies provide a multitude of job openings. However, it doesn't mean that they are the most significant and outstanding. People's daily life cannot live without social science like history, languages, law, and economics. If any part lacks, society is not able to work.

Your perspective that both fields are essential for society's function and the interaction between them is a strong point. However, there are areas that could be improved to make your essay more effective and aligned with the required format and content clarity.

Firstly, while you introduce the topic and your personal stance, the essay could benefit from a more structured approach. Consider organizing your essay into five paragraphs as follows:

1. Start with an introduction that restates the prompt to ensure you clearly understand and address the essay question.
2. Discuss the first public point of view that supports history and social sciences without assigning gender bias, explaining why some people find these subjects important.
3. Then, present the second public point of view that favors sciences and technology, again in a neutral and inclusive language.
4. Share your personal view and experiences to support the argument that you believe both fields are crucial, providing specific reasons.
5. Conclude by summarizing your discussion points and reiterating the importance of both subjects to society, ending with a powerful concluding sentence.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, watch for unintended run-on sentences and ensure that your points are clearly separated and developed. You might also want to refine the portrayal of students in science and social science to avoid overgeneralizing personality traits.

The clarity of your point of view is evident, but the arguments could be more descriptive and supported by examples or further reasoning. Remember, illustrating your points with specific examples can significantly strengthen your argument.

In summary, your essay brings an important perspective to the debate between the value of social sciences versus sciences. By organizing your thoughts more clearly, avoiding generalizations, and enhancing your argumentation, your essay can more effectively communicate its message.

In my opinion, this is a good practice because not only will it save non-smokers from the evils of passive smoking, but it will also prevent young people from getting into the habit of smoking. \n To begin with, smoking can be a choice for many people but the others who are around them also have to face hazardous health consequences when they inhale the cigarettes' smoke unknowingly. For instance, a study has shown that 60% of the passive smokers, who stay around active smokers, suffer from severe diseases such as lung cancer and respiratory issues. Therefore, by restricting people from smoking in public areas, non-smokers will get benefited. \n It must be also pointed out that young people generally start smoking because they are influenced by older smokers. For example, teenagers who are close to people who smoke can get into the habit of smoking because adults are showing them that this is normal behaviour. Although they may be aware of the consequences of smoking, youngsters might be inspired by people who exert influence on them. For that reason, restricting the liberty of smoking anywhere can prevent juveniles from becoming addicted to tobacco and having to face the nicotine evils in their organisms. \n In conclusion, smokers are aware of the serious consequences of smoking and in spite of this, they smoke. Hence, the government has banned smoking in public places. From my point of view, this is an appropriate approach that will prevent passive smokers from developing health issues as well as young people from becoming a smoker.","There will be points deductions for this essay because you changed the prompt response requirement in your paraphrased paragraph. The question is: \n <em>Question: Do you agree or disagree ?<br/>Your Response: in my opinion, this is a good practice ...</em> \n Your biggest mistake in this essay, which will definitely harm your final score, is that you turned this into an opinion essay instead of an agree/disagree essay. The proper response format is: \n <em>I agree with this statement for several reasons.</em> \n That said, your reasoning is aligned with the prompt. However, your second body of paragraph sort of spun off topic before going back to the original discussion. So maybe this will get a score of 5. Try to start the sentences with the topic sentence before the reasoning, that way your sentences will not appear to be going off topic before going back to the actual topic. This is what happened in your second body paragraph and it almost cost you severe point deductions. \n Then you could have immediately thrown yourself into the supporting discussions in the body paragraphs. For this type of essay, you should present a weak opposing discussion in the first body paragraph and then present a strong defense of your stance, based on the opposing discussion in the second body paragraph. You may even extend the essay into a third body paragraph to further strengthen your stance on the discussion. \n You need to fully utilize the word allotment for this essay, which is normally a maximum of 300 words, to reach the maximum scoring possibility for every grading consideration. Write the minimum ideal number of 275 and you will get a moderate scoring consideration. Write the ideal maximum number of 300 words and you will see your overall scores get a boost, specially in the C&C section.","The essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing the benefits of banning smoking in public places. This includes protecting non-smokers from the dangers of passive smoking and discouraging young people from starting to smoke. The position is clear and supported with specific examples and arguments, demonstrating an understanding of the issue.

However, the essay strays from the required response format for an agree/disagree prompt. Instead of stating a clear position of agreement or disagreement as requested, the essay is framed as expressing an opinion. The correct approach should be a direct statement of agreement or disagreement, such as ""I agree with this statement for several reasons,"" to meet the prompt's requirements directly.

Additionally, the organization of the essay could be improved to ensure that each paragraph directly supports the main argument without deviating from the topic. The second body paragraph, for example, begins by veering slightly off-topic before returning to the main discussion. A more effective strategy would be to start each paragraph with a topic sentence that clearly connects to the thesis, maintaining focus and coherence throughout.

In terms of content, while the essay provides a solid foundation, it could benefit from expanding the argument to include a balanced perspective. Introducing a weak opposing argument in the first body paragraph and then countering it with stronger supporting points in subsequent paragraphs could strengthen the essay. This approach not only demonstrates an understanding of the issue from multiple angles but also enriches the argument.

Lastly, to maximize scoring potential, it is advised to fully utilize the word limit. Writing closer to the maximum word count allows for a more thorough exploration of the topic, which can enhance the clarity and complexity (C&C) of the essay.

From all walks of life, people make everyday life easier by using computers, especially for undergraduate learners. As we know, a computer is necessary for college students for three reasons: taking online courses, keeping connection and doing some research. \n First and foremost, due to the serious impact of COVID-19 in our life, many countries have come up with a solution that creates an online learning network which can help students access to classes and discuss in groups easily. Furthermore, studying online requires more self-motivation and time-management skills because college students have to live with deadlines and try to not fail the course. \n Secondly, computers can help to keep connecting with long-distance friends and family over email and social networks. For instance, many students move away from their hometown to get to their universities in the different locations and time by time they will feel burdened on their shoulders and need encouragement from their families. So the best way to communicate is using face-time, text message and voicemail through social networks and other utility apps. \n Last but not least, when the computer connects to the internet, your choices and available options are almost limitless. Undoubtedly, students are the one who needs information to help their learning as well as improve their knowledge and with just one click, vast amounts of results will show up for in less than a minute. \n To sum up, the use of computers in education has increased dramatically in a positive way. The more effective computer is, the more students use it to maintain close relationships with family and friends, study online and above all, find information on the internet. Therefore, computer is regarded as essential tools for students to catch up with innovative technology in modern society. Whereby, in the near future computers will make enormous breakthroughs as the bridge to link people together.","Please limit your writing in the task 2 part of the essay to no more than 290 words.

It won't be hard to keep track of the word count. If you are taking the computer test, you will see the word count on the screen. If you are taking the pencil test, count the lines you have written, you need at least 20-25 lines to meet the word requirement. \n Now, I have a problem with reviewing your essay for relevant content. You did not include the original prompt, which is required with every posting, so I cannot review this prompt accuracy. I'll have to limit my review to grammar issues and the advice I gave you about the word count above. \n Cannot is the negative form of the verb ""can"". Therefore, it should not be written as ""can not"". Avoid using repeated words in your presentation as these come across as either memorized or over used expressions. So ""more and more"" should simply be ""more"". The same goes for ""walks of life"" which can be replaced with ""social classes"" or ""levels of society"".

You've correctly identified and elaborated on three key areas where computers have become indispensable: online learning, maintaining connections, and conducting research. Your efforts to develop these ideas are evident and contribute positively to your essay's overall impact.

However, for an English proficiency test, attention to the structure and conciseness of your writing is crucial. Your essay would benefit from a more precise approach to word count management. Keeping your essay within a recommended limit, such as around 290 words for Task 2, will not only demonstrate your ability to express ideas succinctly but also ensure you manage your time effectively during the test. To achieve this, focus on the clarity and brevity of your points rather than elaborate explanations.

Grammar and spelling accuracy are also integral. The phrase ""can not"" should be written as ""cannot"" to maintain correct grammar. Likewise, avoid repetitive phrases like ""more and more,"" which can simply be ""more."" Also, consider alternative expressions to ""walks of life,"" such as ""levels of society,"" which can enhance your essay's readability and precision.

Your essay's point of view is adequately established, reflecting on the necessity of computers for students. However, clarity in your arguments could be improved by refining your sentence structure and ensuring your ideas directly support your viewpoint without unnecessary elaboration.

Your arguments are relevant, yet they could be more compelling with precise examples and a clearer connection to the theme. For instance, when discussing online learning, briefly mention specific platforms or techniques that showcase computers' integral role, ensuring your argument is both descriptive and directly linked to the point being made.

Finally, responding directly to the essay topic is crucial, and without knowing the original prompt, it’s essential to regularly revisit the question to ensure your essay remains focused and relevant throughout your writing. This approach assures that your response is aligned with the expected content and accurately addresses the task at hand.

Incorporating these adjustments will significantly enhance the quality of your essay.

Some of the most successful companies like Facebook or Google are famous with the relaxed shades offices where the decorations in every contexts are suitable for innovative and effective atmosphere. If employees worked in an office that has too many and inapropriate colours or patterns on the walls, they would hardly pay attention and then make their work unproductive. Additionally, visitors and customers may be too curious with the colours surroundings them to focus on what they are looking for. As the result, an creative and efficient colours' place would be ideal work contexts for everyone. \n Similarly, hospital colours codes are also conducted strictly to enhance patient's health. Bright colours would be less acceptable on a hospital ward, where patients are trying to recover from operations and sickness. In fact, relaxing colours are decorated such as pastels in order to create a cozy peaceful and energetic room for resting. On the other hand, children's room in hospital areas are likely to need some forms of entertainment; a wall that have nice pictures and posters in oranges and bright red. Also, doctors and nurses might prefer brighter surroundings when they take a break from work. \n In conclusion, colours have a direct link to our feelings and It is vital to design our surrounding lives that the occupants could be able to have their best.","Dear student, whatever you do, never use Grammarly for checking your grammar in the essays. It steals your essay and information which means you lose the rights to the essay that you just wrote. That is a very bad idea. Rather, read more English grammar rule books and do more grammar exercises. Both are available online as apps and neither will steal your essay information which might prove to be a problem for you in the future. \n In reality, your essay is not bad at all. It can easily gain you a passing score at the very least because your discussion for the most part is clear and within the requirements of the prompt. You also show a clear idea of public understanding about the effects of color in the workplace and in a health care setting. That is fantastic because you allowed yourself to show how well read you are when it comes to current events and pop culture. That will definitely help in increasing your TA score. \n The main problem I have with your writing is that in the opening paraphrase, you failed to answer the direct question regarding how true the statement is. However, you did good work in explaining that the essay will be about how the colors affect people in the workplace and recuperating places like hospitals. While this paragraph is missing one set of responses to the direct questions, you also neglected to provide the minimum 3 sentence format as the minimum requirement for the task 2 essay. You are also lacking the proper summary conclusion of the discussion since you left the essay open ended with a single sentence presentation. Aim to score better with at least 3 sentences so that you can show your English grammar and vocabulary skills to the examiner. \n Overall, you have the potential to score at least a 5.5 - 6 with this type of writing. Which is a very good start for you.","The essay on the impact of color in our lives, particularly in offices and hospitals, presents a thoughtful discussion on how colors can affect our mood and productivity. It is commendable that the essay addresses the topic directly, discussing the emotional influences of color outside domestic settings. Your ability to link color with emotions and functional spaces like workplaces and healthcare environments reflects well on your understanding of the subject. This is a strong point that contributes positively to the overall discussion.

However, there are areas where improvements can bolster the essay's effectiveness and clarity. Firstly, attention to grammar and spelling is crucial for conveying ideas more clearly. For example, maintaining consistency in the spelling of ""color"" (American English) or ""colour"" (British English), correcting ""this essay will discuss"" to ""This essay will discuss,"" and ensuring proper use of articles would enhance the readability of your essay. Misplacements and omissions of articles (a, an, the) are noticeable throughout the text and revising these would significantly improve grammatical accuracy.

The introduction of your essay sets the stage for the discussion but falls short of fully addressing the essay prompt; it would be beneficial to include a thesis statement that outlines your main argument or perspective on the importance of color. This would not only satisfy the task requirement but also offer your readers a clear understanding of your viewpoint right from the beginning.

Your discussion on the importance of color in workplaces and hospitals is insightful, yet it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or studies to support your claims. For instance, mentioning any research findings on how colors influence mood and productivity could substantiate your arguments, making them more convincing.

The essay’s conclusion could be more impactful with a comprehensive summary of the points discussed. Rather than ending the essay with a broad statement about the importance of colors, summarizing how specific colors affect emotions and productivity in offices and hospitals could reinforce your argument, providing a more satisfying closure to your essay.

Lastly, while the essay shows a promising understanding of the topic, varying your sentence structures could enhance the flow and readability of your writing. Short and direct sentences can be effective, but combining them with more complex structures can add depth and interest to your writing style.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a promising grasp of the topic and a clear point of view.

While the intention to highlight teachers' importance is clear, there are several aspects of the essay that need improvement for a more effective argument and to meet the essay requirements. Here are some constructive feedback points that can help enhance your essay:

1. **Topic Response and Structure**: The introduction should precisely reflect the topic without adding personal opinions or altering its original presentation. Your opening sentence shifts the discussion into a personal viewpoint which is not in line with the requirements of presenting the topic as is. Remember, the first paragraph should be a restatement of the original topic, followed by your response to the question asked. Furthermore, the essay lacks a conclusive paragraph, which left your argument open-ended. Every essay should have a clear introduction, a body that discusses your points, and a conclusion that summarises your argument and reflects on the topic.

2. **Avoiding Contractions**: In formal writing, which is required in such essays, avoid using contractions (like ""can't"", ""don't""). Always use the full form of the words (""cannot"", ""do not"") to maintain the academic tone of the essay.

3. **Word Usage and Grammar**: The term ""information"" does not have a plural form; it remains ""information"" whether in singular or plural contexts. Pay attention to the grammar and the correct use of words to improve the readability and correctness of your essay. Also, ensure to review and correct grammatical errors and enhance sentence clarity.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: Your essay would benefit from more structured and clear arguments. While you provided an example from your own experience, your arguments overall lacked depth and clarity. It's important to distinctly outline your points and support them with concrete examples or reasoning. Additionally, strive for a balance between sharing personal experiences and general arguments that underscore the value and necessity of teachers.

5. **Point of View and Stylistic Issues**: Your point of view on the invaluable role of teachers is evident; however, the way you've presented your arguments could be improved for coherence and impact. Avoid long, run-on sentences and strive for more straightforward and concise expressions. Organize your ideas systematically to build your case more effectively.

6. **Spelling and Grammar**: Watch out for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors that can distract from your message. Consider using spellcheck tools and reread your essay to catch and correct these mistakes.

This has brought some benefits as well as drawbacks for these countries. From my view, the advantages seem to surpass the disadvantages. \n On the one hand, a huge number of citizens being young adults mean the authorities need to spend a lot to nurture them because they totally have right for getting access to advanced education system and healthcare as well. Another thing is the lack of skillful workers. A society with many youngsters would make a blank for jobs that needs strong experience labor. For instance, leader or high- level manager positions in most enterprises tend to be offered for people who has had enough experience and undergone these jobs over a long period. And this seldom occurs in the opposite way. \n On the other hand, a tiny number of older people would allow the government to save a considerable budget for housing and caring them until they die. It is the truth because the expenditure for constructing a nursing home and providing accompanied services often costs so much. In addition, many youngers would provide an abundant labor force for the economy. Take industrial zones as an example. Most workers are young because working here requires them to have a strong health and bold enthusiasm. Last but not least, a younger generation will lead a country to more prosperity, globalization period in particular. \n In conclusion, it is not right or wrong to judge the claims of a country with younger population. However, it still comprises both pros and cons in any circumstance. For me, the benefits seem to be excess due to the huge workforce, welfare cost savings and even creativity the young people could bring back for the evolution of a nation.","Dear student, this is a direct response question. The response should be coming from a singular point of view. A direct response essay is never discussed as a comparison essay. Actually, unless the prompt clearly instructs you to compare the points of view presented, you are to assume, as the writer, that the singular point of view is the required response for the essay. This is a standard ruling applied to all Task 2 essays. \n Do not use the term ""seem"" in your thesis statement within the opening paragraph. The term ""seem"" indicates an indecisiveness on your part. You have not made a decision regarding your response to the question that you actually believe in and support. As such, your succeeding discussions become weak because you do not have the conviction to support your singular point of view. \n The idea is to prove that your point of view is the correct one by giving a strong discussion regarding it. You may pose the opposing discussion as a topic discussion theme in the paragraph but the discussion you present should explain the weakness in it. For example, you can say that: \n <em>One advantage of having a large number of young adults has to do with a younger workforce. While the older generation acts in a leadership role, the younger workers bring innovations and potential avenues for improvement to the craft. The older employees are not capable of...</em> \n If the comparison is done from a singular point of view, presenting an opposing discussion helps to strengthen your line of reasoning. Avoid using a compare and contrast paragraph presentation because that shows the reader that you are not really convinced nor supportive of the point of view that you chose to present in the discussion. \n The idea behind this sort of prompt is to weaken the opposing argument by finding the problems with their concepts using an opposing argument within the same paragraph. That is a totally different approach from a compare and contrast essay response. In this case, it is a singular opinion response that uses opposing arguments to strengthen its case. Refer to my sample presentation above for future reference.","The essay addresses the topic at hand by discussing the imbalance between the younger and older populations in a country and its effects. You've made an effort to present both benefits and drawbacks of this demographic shift, aiming to support the viewpoint that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. However, there are key areas for improvement to make your essay more effective and aligned with the expectations of a direct response essay.

Firstly, it's essential to maintain a singular perspective throughout your essay. The prompt requires a direct response, focusing on proving why your viewpoint is the most valid. While you attempt to present a balanced view by discussing both advantages and disadvantages, this approach dilutes the strength of your argument. Instead of comparing both sides equally, introduce opposing viewpoints as a way to strengthen your main argument by highlighting their weaknesses.
 
In your thesis statement and throughout your essay, avoid using terms like ""seem"" that suggest indecisiveness. Such language weakens your position because it indicates a lack of conviction in your viewpoint. Be confident in your stance and articulate it clearly from the beginning. This clarity and decisiveness will lend credibility and strength to your arguments.

Concerning your arguments, focus on enhancing them with specific examples and detailed explanations that directly support your perspective. For instance, rather than merely stating that a younger population could lead to prosperity and globalization, explain how the dynamism and creativity of young adults contribute to these outcomes, potentially overshadowing the drawbacks. 

In terms of grammar and style, there are instances of awkward phrasing and minor errors that could be polished for better readability. Phrases like ""a huge number of citizens being young adults mean the authorities need to spend a lot"" could be rephrased for clarity and conciseness. Also, be attentive to subject-verb agreement and the correct use of articles (""a"", ""an"", and ""the"").

Lastly, your essay's conclusion reiterates the mixed nature of having a younger population but could be more forceful by strongly restating your main argument. Summarize your key points briefly to reinforce why the advantages, in your view, outweigh the disadvantages.

In summary, refine your essay by adopting a singular perspective, using decisive language, strengthening your arguments with focused examples, addressing minor grammatical issues, and concluding with a powerful restatement of your viewpoint.

These articles plays a pivotal role in modern day life as it makes the life of an individual easier. It is believed that benefits of these items are far more than their demerits. \n Firstly, in order to keep up with the fast pace of modern day life, one has to make his daily routine life simple and easy. Nowadays, the idea behind all the items in departmental stores and supermarkets is to sell the product in a ready-made fashion. This will save the time of the consumer and he will not make an extra effort in daily routine tasks. For example, in the modern-day world one can easily get all kinds of prepared sauces, readymade washing powders and floor cleaners and quite surprisingly cooked frozen foods are also available in all markets. The importance of these disposable products can be determined by the sheer fact about their supply and demand. \n Secondly, these goods offer quality at cheap prices. Customers weigh the efficiency and quality at a reasonable price against the amount of time one needs to prepare the same quality product. People want to spend maximum and quality time with family and friends, and this is only possible if their time is not squandered in preparing items that are readily available in markets at affordable prices. For instance, it is commonly seen that refrigerators in the houses of even a middle-class family are flooded with readymade juices and sandwiches.

This is the reason more and more people are purchasing simple and easy to use products. Apart from the fact, that these goods have made people lives trouble free, they are shifting the balance from independence and self-reliance towards dependency and sluggishness.","what is the prompt that you are responding to with this prompt?

1. Topic Response: It's unclear whether your essay directly addresses the assigned topic as the original prompt wasn't provided. For future essays, always begin by restating the prompt in your introduction to clarify the topic and your stance. This helps the reader understand the relevance and direction of your discussion.

2. Paragraph Structure: The balance in your essay's structure needs attention. Each paragraph should have a roughly equal number of sentences, aiming for consistency. This uniformity helps in keeping the reader's attention and ensuring that each part of your argument is equally developed. Remember, a well-structured essay typically has an intro, body paragraphs with clear points, and a conclusion that doesn't introduce new ideas but summarizes the discussion.

3. Concluding Paragraph: Your conclusion should serve as a summary of your essay's main points rather than introducing new arguments. The aim is to reinforce what has already been said and leave the reader with a clear understanding of your stance on the subject. In your case, try to succinctly recap the benefits of consumer goods and how they outweigh the drawbacks, without adding new information.

4. Spelling, Grammar, and Style: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors in your essay (""articles plays"" should be ""articles play"", etc.). Also, enhancing the variety in sentence structure could make your writing more engaging. Practicing these aspects can significantly improve the clarity and professionalism of your essay.

5. Clarity and Argumentation: While your point of view is mostly clear, making your arguments more descriptive and robust could strengthen your essay. For instance, rather than just stating that consumer goods are beneficial, delve deeper into how these benefits specifically outweigh their disadvantages. Providing more detailed examples and perhaps some statistics or studies could make your arguments more persuasive.

In summary, focus on directly addressing the prompt, maintaining a balanced paragraph structure, succinctly concluding your essay, and refining your grammar and argumentation.

To improve your essay's readability, I recommend carefully proofreading your work or using a spelling and grammar check tool.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** While you attempt to cover both the benefits of technology and traveling, the essay's main standpoint becomes muddled. This ambiguity makes it difficult to discern your true opinion on the matter. Clarifying your viewpoint will strengthen your argument and ensure the reader understands your position.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your essay includes arguments for both the utility of the internet in exploring other cultures and the irreplaceable value of physical travel. However, to adhere to the prompt's requirements, develop a single line of reasoning after choosing your side. Use specific examples and clearer explanations to support your viewpoint. For example, when discussing the limitations of learning about a country through the internet, provide concrete examples of experiences or elements of cultural understanding that cannot be replicated online.

In summary, ensure your essay specifically responds to the prompt by choosing a side and supporting it consistently throughout your essay. Pay attention to spelling and grammar to improve clarity and professionalism. Make your point of view clear from the beginning and support it with well-explained and specific arguments. Implementing these suggestions will substantially enhance the quality of your essay and better convey your insights on the topic.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

In fact, large groups of parents are afraid that their children may suffer a heavy amount of lessons if they have to do homework after a day-long learning at school. what is more, students at early stages are considered to flourish their brains strongly, so they also need to spend time exploring out-of-school subjects in order to foster their creativity and flexibility. For instance, children can learn to play musical instruments or paintings to manifest their talents. \n On the contrary, some believe there is a need for students to do homework. In that, this is one of the most effective ways to revise their knowledge and enable them to deepen their understanding of these lessons. Furthermore, for the time being, state-of-the-art technologies are ubiquitous in every corner of human lives, and there is no exception in children. As a result, parents believe that having their kids complete homework would reduce the amount of time they spend glued to a TV or smartphone, which can have disastrous repercussions on their developmental stage, such as loneliness and a sensitive disposition. \n Depending on these interpretations, personally, I am in fifty-fifty agreement with each of view. It is true that homework not only do students reflect on their lesson, but it also assists parents in observing their children's competence. However, it is only a good way with enough load of homework which takes them around one hour in the evening. To meet this demand, children will be more relaxed after their daytime and keep their motivation to learn and find new things. \n In a nutshell, as it is discussed above, it is essential to keep children learning at home, but with not too many, actually. Likewise, it is undeniable the fundamental role in observing and accommodating the children's needs to keep their positive learning attitude.","<quotation>This essay will manifest the two views on this matter</quotation> \n This is an incomplete prompt restatement.

Therefore, you cannot use a short cut to represent the discussion focus. \n <quotation>As for the former of both views</quotation> \n This sentence only works if the viewpoint is given prior to this implication. Otherwise, the reader is confused and lost as to what you are referring to. This confusion will directly affect your GRA score since you are expected to clearly express yourself, without confusing the reader with you explanation presentation.","Your essay presents a well-considered discussion of the topic about whether teachers should assign homework to children. You've effectively outlined arguments for and against homework, showcasing understanding from multiple perspectives. However, there are aspects that could be improved to enhance the clarity and impact of your argument. 

1. **Clarity and Response to the Topic:** The essay starts by mentioning 'the former of both views' without clearly introducing these views first. To avoid confusion, it's important to directly state the two views on homework before delving into arguments. For instance, a better approach could be, ""There are two prevalent views regarding homework for children: one advocates for its necessity, while the other opposes due to potential negative impacts on children's well-being and creativity."" This will set a clearer stage for your discussion and assure that your essay is directly responding to the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are a few grammatical and stylistic points to consider. The capitalization in the sentence ""what is more, students at early stages..."" should be corrected to ""What is more..."". Also, ensure consistency in verb tenses and consider varying sentence structures to enhance the flow of your essay. Moreover, the term ""paintings"" should be replaced with ""painting"" when referring to the activity.

3. **Author's Point of View:** Your balanced view, being ""fifty-fifty"" in agreement with both sides, is evident. However, this stance could be articulated more clearly early in the essay. Explicitly stating your perspective at the beginning can guide the reader through your arguments with an understanding of where you stand.

4. **Arguments Support:** You provide concrete examples, like children learning musical instruments or painting, to support the idea that activities outside school contribute to creativity and flexibility. Similarly, you mention the role of homework in reinforcing subjects learned at school. Enhancing these arguments with evidence or studies could strengthen your position further. Additionally, while discussing the balance of homework, specifying what an ""enough load of homework"" looks like can provide a more actionable suggestion.

To improve, focus on clearly stating the views being discussed at the beginning, address grammatical and stylistic issues, clarify your stance early on, and bolster your arguments with more specific examples or evidence. By addressing these areas, your essay will become more persuasive and coherent.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

To what extend do you agree or not?,"The number of crimes in recent years is rejuvenating, which poses a serious threat to society. Many people reckon crimes among young adults should be received the punishments as the mature. By contrast, I am totally disagree with this statement. In this essay, I am going to support my viewpoint. \n Firstly, it is irrefutable that young people often behave with emotional motivation rather than rationality. Thus, they could commit a crime by mistake for not controlling themself. That they are not mentally mature enough to fully be aware of the consequences of their actions, along with the fact that they are dominated by their emotions, breaking the law is an unavoidable result. In addition, when they are too young and lack social understanding, they could easily be lured into social evils. For example, the juvenile who is bullied at school for a long time could fight back against the bully when he could not bear bullying anymore. As a result of being out of control, he might cause physical harm to others. Hence, it is unfair if this boy had to receive a punishment as an adult. \n On the other hand, imposing serious punishment on juveniles might cause acute pain. According to the above instance, if the boy had to be punished by law, which would become a hole in his coat and it is hard for him to have a better future. Moreover, when the children commit an offence, they are vulnerable to the far-reaching consequences that come with it. They tend to be a bad person and easily reoffend with the high potential of repeating that type of conduct. To illustrate, a massive number of people in society have unfriendly look and look down on people who used to be lawbreakers, which makes it difficult to find an orthodox job and thus, they might be forced to commit crimes as a way of making a living. \n In conclusion, we should raise children's awareness of the context of law and educate the children on keep emotions under their control rather than imposing stricter punishments on them.","<quotation>rejuvenating</quotation> \n Be careful with your word usage. The wrong word can decrease your LR, GRA, and C+C scores. Rejevenating means to re-energize.

You could fail the test that way.","Your essay addresses a significant and complex issue—whether young adults should receive the same punishments for crimes as mature adults. Your stance against imposing adult-level punishments on young adults is clear throughout the essay. However, there are areas for improvement that could strengthen your argument and make your essay more effective.

**1. Responding to the Topic:**
You have chosen a relevant topic and provided a clear statement of your viewpoint. However, the introduction could be enhanced by immediately presenting reasons supporting your opinion. Instead of stating, ""In this essay, I am going to support my viewpoint,"" briefly summarize your main arguments. This approach will help you deliver a clear opinion right from the start.

**2. Language Use and Clarity:**
Be cautious with your word choices. For example, ""rejuvenating"" likely does not convey what you intended it to. This seems to be a misunderstanding or misuse of the word, as ""rejuvenating"" suggests renewal or making something fresh again, which does not fit the context of increasing crime rates. Such inaccuracies can confuse readers and impact the clarity of your message.

**3. Point of View Clarity:**
Your point of view is evident, but there's a moment in your essay, specifically when you use ""On the other hand,"" where it appears you might be contradicting your own argument. In a single-opinion essay, it's crucial to consistently support your stance throughout, rather than presenting opposing views unless they are being refuted or discussed to strengthen your original perspective.

**4. Supporting Arguments:**
You provide compelling arguments regarding the emotional and psychological development of young adults and how these factors can lead to criminal behavior. Your example of a juvenile acting out against bullying effectively illustrates your point. To further strengthen your essay, ensure every argument directly supports your viewpoint without seeming to introduce a contradictory perspective.

**5. Grammar and Style:**
Overall, your essay would benefit from closer attention to grammatical detail, such as agreement between subjects and verbs, and the correct use of reflexive pronouns (e.g., ""themself"" should be ""themselves""). Additionally, some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly structured, which can hinder comprehension. Simplifying and clarifying these sentences would make your argument more accessible to readers.

**6. Constructive Suggestion:**
Consider incorporating information on alternative interventions for young offenders, such as educational programs or psychological counseling, to strengthen your argument against harsh punishments. Detailing these alternatives can offer a more comprehensive solution to the issue at hand.

Your essay shows a deep understanding of the topic and provides a humane approach to dealing with juvenile offenders. With careful revision focusing on these mentioned aspects, your argument will be even more persuasive and effective.

In my point of view, I wholeheartedly agree that it is the best way to surmount this problem. In this essay, I am going to express two major reasons to support my position. \n Firstly, the power of constitution is tremendous. What I mean is that when it comes to laws, everyone is afraid of disobeying it. The main reason is that breaking laws would face troubles ranging from a large amount of fine to detention. People always want to commit a crime, they will lose their liberal and basic human rights. That is why governments have to establish certain recycling laws in order to force individuals to adhere. \n Not only just the previous reason, but also that we can set a modal for other countries around the world. We encourage people to discard garbage in different bins because we want to protect our precious Earth. Thus, recycling needs to be done by not only just one country but also everyone who is living in this planet. To achieve this goal, setting laws would be an effective way to show others that recycling is a topical issue that we have to pay attention to. As one country execute this, other nations will follow the same path. Finally, recycling habit is formed in everyone's heart! \n By way of conclusion, I strongly restate my position that governments should make laws to force people recycle more because legislations are powerful. Moreover, setting relevant laws would be a rewarding and cost-effective way to let others know the importance of recycling.","For better TA scoring, always outline your discussion reasons in the paraphrase. This will allow the first paragraph to have a fully developed explanation presentation without your accidentally trying to explain things right off the bat. By outlining your discussion reasons, your paraphrase will leave with examiner with a better understanding of your English comprehension skills as you will show that you have a clear thought process that you can translate into understandable simple and quick English reasoning presentations. Keep it short. Just provide the topic sentences for the reasoning paragraphs. Nothing more nothing less. Then start the reasoning paragraphs with the same topic sentences as an anchor for the examiner's reading. \n You are speaking of criminal law in your first reasoning paragraph. Not recycling is not a criminal offense. Do you mean that it should be turned into a criminal offense with jail or prison time?

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed for better clarity and effectiveness in delivering the message. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the essay can be improved based on specific criteria:

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay effectively addresses the prompt by agreeing with the need for legislation to improve recycling habits. However, it could be enhanced by clearly outlining the reasons for this position in the introductory paragraph. Instead of jumping directly into the argument, briefly mention the two major reasons that will be discussed to support the viewpoint. This strategy helps in setting a clear framework for the essay and guides the reader through the argumentation process more smoothly.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: The essay exhibits a good command of language, but there are a few areas where grammar and style can be improved for better readability. For instance, ensuring that sentences are not overly complex will aid comprehension. Additionally, watch out for misused phrases and make sure expressions are accurately used to convey the intended meaning. Also, consider revising phrases like ""People always want to commit a crime, they will lose their liberal and basic human rights"" for clarity and accuracy, as it might imply an unintended meaning.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The point of view is mostly clear but could be solidified with more precise language. When discussing the idea of laws encouraging recycling, it is crucial to distinguish between civil obligations and criminal offenses. Recycling laws typically do not equate to criminal laws which involve jail time. Clarifying this distinction will prevent confusion and strengthen the argument by making it more realistic and applicable to real-world scenarios.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: The arguments provided are a good start but need to be more detailed and grounded in specific examples or evidence. The claim that laws instill fear of disobedience in people is a bit simplistic. Expanding on how recycling laws can specifically motivate better environmental behaviors and detailing the positive impacts observed in places with such laws will enrich the argument. Additionally, when suggesting that establishing laws can serve as a model for other countries, providing examples of successful implementations could substantiate the claim and offer a more compelling argument.

To further enhance the essay:

- Start with a clearer introduction that briefly outlines the reasons for supporting government-led legislation on recycling.
- Clarify the notion of laws related to recycling, differentiating between civil penalties and criminal offenses to avoid misinterpretation.
- Incorporate specific examples or data to support the argument, enhancing credibility and persuasiveness.
- Ensure clarity in language and grammar for smoother readability and better engagement with the reader.

From my point of view, though it is necessary to enjoy life at all ages, children still need to take responsibility for family and society. \n It is reasonable for students to do what they like outside of school. Nowadays, students spend most of their day studying at school and participating in extracurricular activities. This means they may have less time to enjoy their passions and explore new things in life. Furthermore, the curriculum in many schools is becoming so heavy that students have to invest more effort in completing homework, carrying out projects, and preparing for the upcoming class. Students, therefore, might be under great pressure to catch up with the learning pace of their peers as well as achieve high scores. For students to enjoy a happy childhood, besides learning, they should have opportunities to experience life in a more enjoyable way. \n Nevertheless, being free can create some problems. Because students at a very young age have not developed completely in terms of physics and mentality, if they are able to do whatever they want, they may make poor decisions that could potentially harm themselves. For instance, many students are spending hours a day playing video games with violent scenes that may lead them to unhealthy thoughts and sedentary lifestyles. Parents should encourage them to help with housework because, in this way, children will use their spare time to take responsibility as family members. They need to know that doing household chores is part of their duties, and they will become more responsible and reliable once they get used to taking care of others. Moreover, by doing housework, children will be physically active. As a result, diseases such as obesity and shortsightedness can be prevented. \n In conclusion, although freedom outside of school can provide students with chances to relax and enjoy themselves, it seems to me that children should be assigned extra work after class to show their responsibilities.","The essay lacks in public reasoning and logic. That means, you did not successfully explain the public perceptions in relation to your personal opinion. Therefore, the presentation will be seen as only representing your personal opinion. Missing from this discussion is the reference to other group opinions and beliefs which would have either been in agreement or disagreement with your personal point of view. There is a lack of balance in the discussion as expected by the reviewer. You need to compare your personal opinion with the public sentiment to meet the discuss both points of view requirement, prior to presenting your personal opinion of each common reason. \n Scoring for this essay will be incomplete as only 1 out of 3 explanations were provided. It will come close to a passing mark, but will just miss the passing score due to the lack of proper discussion presentation.","Your essay on whether children should assist at home or have more freedom after school presents a thoughtful discussion. However, to improve and make your arguments stronger, consider the following areas for enhancement:

1. **Response to Topic**: Your essay addresses the topic by presenting your viewpoint on the necessity for children to balance enjoyment of life with taking responsibilities. This is a good start. To further reinforce your response, explicitly compare your views with wider public opinions. This comparison will enrich your essay by showing how your stance fits into broader societal perspectives.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Generally, your essay is well-written with clear sentences. However, paying closer attention to minor grammatical errors and varying your sentence structure could enhance readability and engagement. Using a mix of simple and complex sentences can help keep your reader's attention.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is clear throughout the essay. You believe that while children should enjoy life, they also need to bear some responsibility. To strengthen this, try to explicitly state how common reasoning or public opinion supports or contrasts your viewpoint. This will lend more credibility to your argument.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: You’ve provided arguments to support your position, such as the importance of balancing study with leisure and the potential dangers of too much freedom. However, incorporating examples or statistics from reliable sources could strengthen your arguments. Additionally, discussing public sentiment and how it either aligns with or opposes your viewpoint will provide a more balanced discussion. It's crucial to address both sides of the argument thoroughly before concluding with your opinion.

In summary, your essay would benefit greatly from a more balanced discussion that includes public opinions and contrasts them with your personal stance. This approach will not only validate your viewpoints but will also present a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Agree?","There is a school of thought that believes that people don't need to avoid unpredictable climate. While reasons can be given to justify this, I would agree with that individuals should find solutions to deal with climate change. \n On the one hand, there are those who assert that people should find ways to live with erratic climate. The reasons for this may include in countries, where industrial development is the top priorities. The government in those countries only aim to the economic goal, because they don't want their country to be left behind others. As a result, they use overload natural resources. In the absence of technologies, those countries have difficulties in balancing the economy and the environment. \n On the other hand, I side with those who contend that people should prevent climate change. The first argument is that unpredictable climate results in consequences that affect people in a negative way. For example, the ultra violet radiation may cause health problems in people, specially skin cancers. There are some evidence about that almost all skin cancers are caused by too much UV radiation from the sun. Another justification is that climate change has an impact on many aspects in society. For economic side, droughts last long, which makes farmers unable to harvest their crops. This leads to agriculture products decreases and there is a decline in the GDP. The temperature is higher today than in the past, which has a following influence in the level of water in ocean. Consequently, a large number of forests and accommodations are lost. The government has to allocate the budget to support individuals who suffer from those loss. \n In conclusion, although some citizens think people may live with unstable climate, I firmly believe that what people should do is finding ways to prevent unpredictable climate.","Dear student, the word ""are"" is used to denote the plural form of ""is"". The term ""evidence"" is in singular form. The plural form is ""evidences"". Therefore, to say ""there are evidence"" is incorrect. You need to say ""there is evidence"" since you are referring to only one piece of evidence in the sentence. Since you are writing an academic paper, avoid using contractions such as ""don't"" because it connotes a relaxed or casual method of writing. It is not academically respectful to the reader. While you will not lose points for contractions, it would still be better to spell out the word as in ""do not"" to indicate knowledge of proper sentence structure in an academic setting. \n Please practice writing these essays with a timer.

Remember, within that time frame you need to outline your discussion points, draft your essay, review and correct the content, then finalize for submission. You may just find that 40 minutes will not be enough to get the job done with over 300 written words. \n This is a single opinion essay. Therefore, both reasoning paragraphs should only deal with the supporting evidence of your agreement with the statement. It should not be a comparison discussion because you are not being asked to discuss both points of view, just a single opinion.

However, there are areas for improvement that could enhance the clarity, coherence, and correctness of the essay.

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay attempts to present a balanced view by initially discussing why some people might opt to live with an unpredictable climate. However, as the task requires focusing on a single opinion, the essay should concentrate solely on supporting the view that finding solutions to prevent climate change is necessary. This approach will ensure alignment with the essay prompt and improve the task achievement score.

2. **Grammar and Style**: There are a few grammatical issues that need attention. For instance, it is important to use the correct form of words to match the number they are referring to; ""there is evidence"" is correct, rather than ""there are evidence."" Additionally, academic writing typically avoids contractions such as ""don't"" in favor of ""do not."" This change not only aligns with formal writing standards but also demonstrates a respect towards academic discourse.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay does articulate a personal stance, siding with the argument that individuals should proactively address climate change. To strengthen this viewpoint, ensure that all arguments presented directly support the thesis. Avoid discussing opposing viewpoints unless to refute them as part of supporting your primary argument.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: While there are arguments provided, such as the adverse health impacts of UV radiation and the economic repercussions of changes in agriculture, these could be further developed with more detailed evidence and clearer explanations. Specifically, linking each consequence directly to how preventing climate change can mitigate these issues would offer a more compelling argument.

5. **Practical Suggestions**:
   - Practice writing with a timer to manage your time effectively. Crafting a well-organized essay within the allotted time frame requires practice in outlining, writing, reviewing, and editing swiftly.
   - Refrain from discussing both sides of the argument when the prompt asks for a single opinion. Focus your essay on providing robust support for your stance to maintain relevance and coherence.

I therefore partly agree with the assertion as to me, it is not applicable to some situations. \n Supporters of simply passing trends can point to their reasonable arguments. The power of mass media platforms over our lifestyle is the foremost justification. Teenagers are specifically attracted to fads among their peers. One salient example of this is a phenomenon named 'the hot trend' according to generation Z dictionary in which adolescents seem to have a new interest whenever the latest craze sweeps through their milieu. In 2017, our Fidget Spinners cult experienced an ultimate resurgence in their popularity. Thousands of people at that time were obsessed with these and apparently, they swiftly embedded in our popular culture and made appearances in schools, workplaces, social networks. Though these fast-selling toys provide a pleasing sensory experience, they are quite dangerous and yet almost as quickly, this craze died out and sales fell away after dominating for several months. In the same way, there have been several different toy trends over recent years but undoubtedly, the majority of participants do not actually enjoy playing the same things for a long term. \n On the other hand, leisure activities have been strongly linked to individual enthusiasm from the very start. Truth to be told, interests and hobbies tell a great deal about us more or less. One good example of this would be science. Children and adults who are passionate about science, especially when this interest sprouted from the early days, are definitely not following a fashionable pattern. They are in fact seriously concerned about scientific subjects, numbers and theories. Therefore, most of them choose not to waste their precious time running after transient fads but for researching and reading. Though it is applied to a minimal number of people compared to those preferring trendy crazes, still justifiable to me. \n In conclusion, while some people are drawn to stylish hobbies which I believe is the reality of today's world, others choose their pastimes for more genuine reasons. To my point of view, it is all about personalities underlying their decisions on what activities they would take on.","Your first reasoning paragraph is over explained. It is too wordy and forced you to write over 300 words, which, if you think of the things you need to do within the 40 minute time limit, you may not be able to complete. You need to be more direct with your explanations. A 5 sentence explanation composed of: \n - Topic sentence \n - Supporting reason \n - Example to illustrate your point \n - Additional explanation (optional) \n - Transition sentence \n would be more than sufficient to drive your point home. You are not writing a research paper, just a personal opinion so keep it short to avoid forced errors in your writing such as under developed second topics, GRA problems, C&C issues between the 2 topics in a single paragraph. \n Science is an incorrect example to use in the second paragraph because science is based on an interest in studies, learning, experimentation, and intellectual development. It is not a hobby or interest that can change from time to time. It is because you did not portray a hobby or leisure activity in the second paragraph that your essay failed to deliver a convincing explanation. It is not convincing in the sense that the topic you chose to discuss does not fall under the suggested prompt topic.","The essay addresses the topic about how fashionable trends influence personal interests in pastimes, presenting arguments for both perspectives. However, there are several ways the essay could be improved to better meet the requirements of an English proficiency test, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and relevance.

1. The first paragraph on the influence of passing trends is overly detailed. While the explanation about how these trends impact our choices is appreciated, the point could be made more effectively with a simpler structure. Aim for a clear topic sentence, a supporting reason, an illustrative example, optional additional explanation, and a transition sentence. This concise structure helps to avoid unnecessary complications in your argument and ensures you have enough time to develop your ideas fully within a time-limited test setting.

2. The essay tends to be wordy, with some forced errors in grammar, spelling, and coherence between ideas (C&C issues). Simplifying language and sentence structure can help to reduce these issues, making the essay easier to follow and strengthening the overall argument.

3. The example of science as a personal interest in the second paragraph doesn't quite fit the prompt's focus on hobbies or leisure activities that could be influenced by fashionable trends. Science represents an area of academic or professional interest rather than a pastime that might change according to trends. Choosing an example more closely related to hobbies or leisure activities that can vary over time would make this argument more convincing and relevant to the essay's topic.

4. While the essay's point of view is generally clear, stating the position directly in the introduction and reinforcing it in the conclusion would strengthen the essay. This approach helps to unify the essay and ensures that the reader is fully aware of the author's perspective throughout.

5. Lastly, the essay could benefit from clearer and more descriptive arguments in support of the author’s position. Focusing on specific, relatable examples and explaining their relevance can make the arguments more persuasive and engaging for the reader.

For example, males are considered comparatively good at physical works such as driving taxis and decorating houses because they are physically strong. Similarly, taking care of the household activities and bringing up the children are deemed to be women's duty because most of them are kind, loving and caring. By keeping men or women out of certain occupations, it is more efficient that people can accomplish the duty. \n However, even though both genders are extremely suited for the jobs above, there is a changing trend which are taking place in modern world.

Which is nowhere near what the original prompt required you to discuss. Hence the failing score. You cannot pass any aspect of the test because you already failed the task accuracy portion. As such, it shows that you lack the English comprehension skills to be able to participate in an English discussion on a given topic. Therefore, the rest of the rating criteria no longer applies. It won't matter how good your grammar is when your English comprehension skills are not at an acceptable level for an English speaker / student. In order to pass this test, you must do the following: \n 1. Learn to look for keywords that can help you understand the meaning of the essay. Keywords such as ""women, men, common strengths and weaknesses,exclude, due to gender"", if you understood these words, would have helped you to better respond to the essay prompt \n 2. Practice your English comprehension skills by not doing the actual essay tests yet but rather, allowing yourself to read any English material and then simply have you restate what you read in a manner that your friends and relatives can understand. Once you are comfortable with that and you successfully explain the topics you have read about, then you may proceed with the actual practice tests. \n As of now, this essay will not receive a passing score. You need to work on developing your lexical resources and task accuracy representations in order to increase your chances of getting a passing score in the actual test.","The essay provided offers a viewpoint on the roles of men and women in occupations, discussing differences in capabilities and societal trends towards gender equality in the workforce. However, there are several aspects in which this essay could be improved to better align with the expectations of an English proficiency test.

Firstly, it is crucial to directly address the essay prompt's question. In your case, the prompt seems to focus on whether it is appropriate to exclude certain genders from jobs because of their gender. However, the essay primarily discusses gender equality in the workforce rather than directly addressing the question of exclusion based on gender. It is important to carefully read the prompt and identify key terms that indicate what you should discuss. By closely answering the question asked, your essay will be more relevant and score higher in task accuracy.

To improve comprehension skills, it is advised to practice understanding and restating English texts. This can be done by reading various materials in English and then explaining what you've read in a simplified manner. This exercise will enhance your ability to grasp the core message of texts, which is essential for accurately responding to essay prompts.

Additionally, while the grammar and spelling in the essay are generally acceptable, there are some minor errors and stylistic choices that could be refined. Phrases such as ""it is undoubtedly that man and women are good at different field,"" could be revised for clarity and grammatical accuracy to something like ""it is undeniable that men and women excel in different fields."" Working on grammar and sentence structure will enhance the overall readability and professionalism of your essay.

The essay does succeed in introducing diverse perspectives on gender roles within professions and acknowledges the changing trends towards more gender-balanced workplaces. However, to strengthen the argument, it would be beneficial to avoid generalizations and use more specific, evidence-based examples. Also, ensuring that the viewpoint of the essay is clear and consistently maintained throughout would make the argument more persuasive.

Lastly, it is essential to remain focused on supporting your points with clear and coherent arguments. Each paragraph should contribute to building your case, backed by logical reasoning or examples.

By concentrating on accurately addressing the essay prompt, practicing comprehension and restatement skills, refining grammar and stylistic choices, and focusing on building a clear, well-supported argument, the quality and effectiveness of future essays can be significantly improved.",4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4404,https://essayforum.com/writing/new-technologies-ways-buying-selling-90448/,test,WRITING TASK 2: New technologies and ways of buying and selling,"In this day and age, customers' consumption has been affected distinctively by technological advance and innovative trading methods. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement as several positive and negative changes can be arisen from this common tendency. \n On the one hand, introduction of technology and means of buying and selling would make our lives more utility and straightforward, especially in social distancing by COVID-19 pandemic. More and more online trading networks, such as Shopee and Tiki, have appeared, which is frequently used by consumers of different ages. People would order easily on online and pay their parcels by credit. Their parcels will be delivered to their home so fast. Since we do not need to go out to buy nourishment and necessary goods or contact face-to-face with strangers, we could avoid suffering from Corona virus. \n On the other hand, this phenomenon also has drawbacks. This is illustrated that speed of technological development has grown significantly, which makes the old people not adapt immediately. Besides, citizens who do not have smart phones or other electronic devices connected with the Internet would be impossible to trade goods on online. Places are not equipped with modern technological infrastructure, such as rural areas and mountainous regions, which disrupt online purchase. As a consequence, they would prefer to use traditional methods, include stores, market, and so on, to buy products rather than depend on new technologies or electronic devices. \n In conclusion, new technologies and trading methods help people buy and sell goods easily, particular in COVID-19 pandemic. However, we could not deny disadvantages of this trend, which is inconvenient for the old people or the one not being good at technologies.","The writer wrote allspouse paper that is unrelated to the topic. While the writer provided a measured response as an opinion statement in the first paragraph, the topic focus of the response was incorrect. Thus, the essay will recieve a failing score based on an unrelated response. There was a clear change in topic focus as the following comparison reveals: \n Original Topic: NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND WAYS OF BUYING AND SELLING ARE TRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF CONSUMERS. \n Your Topic: ... several positive and negative changes can be arisen from this common tendency. \n The student has a different topic in mind for the discussion ( positive and negative) from the actual presentation ( transforming the lives of consumers). The correct discussion focus would have been: \n <em>I completely agree that modern gadgets have changed the way people come to own and trade things.</em>","This essay aims to discuss the impact of new technologies and innovative trading methods on consumer behavior, a relevant and significant topic. The clarity of the argument and the identification of both positive and negative aspects show an attempt to provide a balanced view. However, the essay's focus shifts away from the precise topic of how these technologies are ""transforming the lives of consumers"" to a broader discussion on general positive and negative changes. To align more closely with the topic, it might be beneficial to explore specific examples of how these technologies change consumers' daily lives and habits.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and style, there are several areas for improvement:
- Use more accurate wording (e.g., ""technological advancement"" instead of ""technological advance"").
- Correct grammatical errors and sentence structures for better clarity. For instance, ""arisen from this common tendency"" could be phrased as ""arising from this trend"".
- Pay attention to article use (""the Internet"", ""the COVID-19 pandemic"").
- Enhance coherence by linking ideas more smoothly and using transition words effectively.

The essay's point of view is somewhat clear, but could be strengthened by directly stating how new technologies and trading methods impact consumers, rather than implying it through examples. 

To improve the arguments and support the essay's position:
- Offer more detailed examples of how technology facilitates shopping, especially during the pandemic, to illustrate its positive impact clearly.
- Discuss the challenges faced by certain groups (e.g., older adults, individuals without internet access) in more depth, providing specific examples of obstacles and suggesting possible solutions.

In conclusion, the essay demonstrates an understanding of the topic, but could significantly benefit from a more focused approach that directly addresses the assignment prompt. Examining specific ways in which technology transforms consumer lives, alongside clearer, more precise language and structured arguments, will make the essay more compelling and on-topic.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

You do not express a clear position on the discussion, and your ideas remain underdeveloped due to your difficulty in presenting your opinions and thoughts on the matter in the English language. You have an extremely limited ability to portray cohesive devices in your sentence development which left you with highly limited control over your word formation when it came to sentence presentation. There are simply too many grammatical errors and sentence structure problems in your essay for it to be considered for a score higher than the one that I gave you. You must go back and study how to form simple English sentences, learn how to properly do that, and then practice writing simple sentences before you try to write another practice test. That is because I doubt, based upon your current skills that simply writing the practice tests will help you improve your skills. You need basic training before on to advanced English language training.","Your essay addresses the topic of traveling to rural areas, including both its benefits and drawbacks. However, there are several areas where improvements are needed to enhance the coherence, clarity, and quality of your essay. Here are some specific points of feedback intended to help you improve:

1. **Response to the Topic**: While your essay attempts to discuss the merits and demerits of traveling to rural areas, the response to the topic feels somewhat incomplete. This is because your arguments are not fully developed. It's important to clearly state your position on the issue and then provide detailed reasons and examples to support your viewpoint.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Your essay contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that make it difficult to understand. To improve, focus on forming simple, correct sentences before moving on to more complex structures. Pay attention to articles (""a"", ""an"", ""the""), verb tense consistency, and subject-verb agreement. Also, consider using tools or resources to check your spelling and grammar.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is not clearly expressed in the essay. A clear thesis statement at the beginning can help readers understand your position right from the start. Each paragraph should then present a clear argument supporting your position, leading to a stronger and clearer expression of your views.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments provided are somewhat vague and lack detailed explanation or examples. For each point you raise, try to provide specific examples or evidence to back it up. For instance, when mentioning the negative impact on the environment, detail specific examples of damage and suggest ways travelers can minimize their impact.

5. **Coherence and Cohesion**: Your essay struggles with coherence (the flow of ideas) and cohesion (the connections between ideas). To improve coherence, organize your essay with a clear introduction, body paragraphs (each with a single main idea), and a conclusion. For cohesion, use transitions (""Furthermore"", ""In addition"", ""However"") to connect sentences and paragraphs smoothly.

6. **Conclusion and Summary**: The conclusion of your essay reiterates the need for preparation but could be stronger by summarizing your main points more clearly and reaffirming your viewpoint.

Improving in these areas requires practice and patience. Starting with basic sentence construction and gradually adding complexity as your confidence grows can be incredibly beneficial. Reading a wide range of texts in English can also help you get a sense of how effective arguments are structured and presented.

Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice, feedback, and a willingness to learn. Keep working on these aspects, and you'll see progress in your English proficiency and essay writing skills.",2,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,3,1,Argumentative

Traditional education is defined as teacher-centered delivery of instruction to classes of students who are the receivers of information. This is a traditional learning method so there are disadvantages such as passive students, teachers cannot care for each student. \n Besides, students can not find strengths, weaknesses in themselves. \n In addition to, the more developed the society, the more developed the education. So there are many differences between previous and present education : \n August 1945, the end of War Word II. The Janpanese and the French were defeated by Viet Minh. Since then, Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence. The goals of the historical period were: ''Fighting huger, poverty and illiterate'' as three key important tasks of then Vietnamese Government and people so curricula were simplified to focus on productive requirement of wartime. For the entire country, there will be literacy classes established for farmers and workers to attend at night. That is training skills : reading, writing,... Teachers don't need any degree because they taught the simple things while the students were of all ages, gender. January 1946, lauched a campaign against illiteracy. Within less than a year, 75 thousand literacy classes with nearly 96 thousand teachers to help 2.5 million people get out of illiteracy. \n Now, education in Vietnam is a state-run system of public and private education run by the Ministry of Education and Training.

The classrooms are spacious, fully equipped with: air conditioner, projector, TV.

It feels like you are just picking up the discussion points from any point in the history of Vietnam and its educational development.

The new educational platform of Vietnam (post colonialization) \n 4. Modern Vietnamese education \n Within each section for discussion, you can do a comparison of previous educational models with the model that replaced it and then look at why the next version was a more efficient educational system than the previous one. That way, when you reach the modern educational method, you will have clearly explained not only the evolution of education, but why Vietnamese education is finally a class unto itself as an admirable educational foundation for today's Vietnamese youth.","The essay aims to compare traditional and modern educational methods, focusing on the Vietnamese context. While the topic is intriguing, there are areas that require improvement for clearer communication and stronger engagement with the reader.

1. **Adherence to the Topic:**
The essay attempts to address the changes in educational methods over time, specifically in Vietnam. However, the discussion feels scattered, touching randomly on different historical points without a clear structure. To make the essay more cohesive, consider organizing it in the following way:
   - Briefly introduce the historical background of Vietnamese education.
   - Discuss education in Vietnam under different periods, such as before colonization, during colonial rule, post-colonization, and the modern educational system.
   - For each period, compare the educational methods used then to those introduced in the subsequent period, highlighting the improvements and reasons for these changes.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
The essay contains several grammar and stylistic issues that can distract readers and make the essay harder to understand. For example:
   - Be careful with punctuation and conjunctions. Instead of ""In addition to, the more developed the society..."", use ""Additionally, as society developed..."".
   - Pay attention to verb tenses for clarity and consistency. For instance, ""lauched"" should be ""launched"".
   - Use specific and varied vocabulary to describe historical changes more vividly and accurately.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:**
The point of view seems to lean towards advocating for the evolution of educational methods in Vietnam. However, this stance is not clearly articulated. To strengthen your position, explicitly state your viewpoint in the introduction and conclusion, reiterating why you believe these changes in educational methodology are significant.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
The essay mentions several changes and developments in Vietnamese education but lacks depth in explaining why these changes represent an improvement or how they impact students' learning experiences. To enhance your arguments:
   - Provide specific examples of old vs. new teaching methods, and explain why the new methods are more effective.
   - Discuss the role of technology, teacher training, and curriculum updates in enhancing education.
   - Use statistics or historical evidence to support claims about improvements in literacy rates or educational outcomes.

Remember, a good essay not only presents facts but also connects them in a way that supports a clear thesis. The suggested structure will help guide the reader through the evolution of Vietnamese education logically and compellingly.

In spite of making people's life much more convenient and enjoyable, this, more dangerously, causes serious harm to our environmental health. \n Some people think that the main problem we are facing now is the loss of wide range of animals and plants, which is obviously explainable: the more the society grows, the more resources we need to satisfy our increasing demands. The global population has reached around 9 billion which is much more than that of the last century. As there are more people, we expand our territory further for both living and exploiting natural resources. As a result, the land we are using briskly overlap that of fauna and flora, which cause natural vegetation to disappear and all animals living in it to have no place to hide. If this continues to happen, those plants and animals may stand in the brink of extintion and in fact, many of them are. \n In addition, there are also numerous other environmental issues we need to be aware of such as plastic waste or air pollution, etc. The single-use consumerism is quickly becoming prevailing in the present time while people use a lot of disposable cups, straws, boxes for just one time, which day by day piles up in our ocean poisoning marine species.

However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to better meet the requirements of the assignment and enhance its overall effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay is expected to address a prompt or question directly. In this case, the essay does not clearly state or paraphrase the original essay prompt at the beginning, nor does it outline the two public opinions for discussion. It's crucial to start the essay by restating the question or topic and providing a brief overview of the points that will be discussed. This will not only help in directly answering the given question but also in making the essay's purpose and direction clear from the outset.

2. **Clear Position:** While the essay hints at a personal viewpoint towards environmental problems, it falls short of explicitly stating a personal opinion in response to the prompt. A clear statement of your position regarding the issue being discussed is essential, particularly if the essay prompt asks for your opinion. This helps in making your stance clear to the reader and provides a solid foundation for your argument.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** There are a few spelling and grammar mistakes present, such as ""extintion"" which should be spelled as ""extinction"", and ""contanminated"" which should be ""contaminated"". Also, words like ""undoutedly"" should be corrected to ""undoubtedly"". These errors can distract readers and make the essay harder to understand. Improving spelling and grammar will enhance the clarity and professionalism of your writing. Furthermore, consider breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones to improve readability and ensure your ideas are conveyed clearly.

4. **Supporting Arguments:** The essay does a good job of identifying environmental issues but could benefit from more detailed examples and evidence to support its claims. For instance, when discussing pollution, providing specific examples of its effects on health or the environment could strengthen the argument. Remember, detailed and descriptive arguments make your position more persuasive.

5. **Adherence to Instructions:** It's essential to carefully read and follow the essay instructions or prompt. This essay overlooks the requirement to explain two public opinions and to clearly state a personal opinion in response to the prompt. Always ensure your essay directly addresses the required elements to avoid missing out on crucial points.

In summary, while the essay tackles a significant topic with enthusiasm, focusing on directly answering the prompt, clarifying your personal viewpoint, correcting spelling and grammatical errors, providing more detailed supporting evidence, and closely following essay instructions will make your argument more compelling and your writing more effective.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay successfully addresses the given topic by discussing the potential benefits of more interesting science lessons. However, it would be helpful to directly tackle the reasons why students currently find science classes boring. Understanding and outlining these reasons at the beginning can provide a stronger foundation for your arguments.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While the essay is mostly clear, there are a few areas where spelling, grammar, and stylistic improvements can be made. For instance, ""knowledges"" should be ""knowledge"" as ""knowledge"" in English is uncountable. Also, more attention to punctuation, such as the use of commas and periods, can improve the readability of your essay. Watch out for run-on sentences and try breaking them into shorter, more concise sentences. Simplifying complex ideas with clearer language will also make your essay more accessible.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your stance on making science lessons more interesting is evident throughout the essay. To further strengthen your viewpoint, explicitly stating how this change can lead to a broader impact on students’ enthusiasm for learning would be beneficial. Make it clear why this issue matters to you and to society.

4. **Arguments and Descriptive Support**: Your arguments for why engaging science lessons are beneficial are a great start. However, specific examples or suggestions on how to make science classes more interesting would greatly enhance your argument. Consider including innovative teaching methods, the use of technology, or interactive projects as examples. Furthermore, explaining how these changes could help students remember and apply scientific knowledge more effectively would make your argument more compelling.

5. **Improvement Suggestions**:
    - Begin the essay by delving into the reasons behind students' lack of interest in science classes. This could involve discussing traditional teaching methods or the absence of practical applications.
    - Offer detailed suggestions for making science lessons more engaging. For example, include ideas like incorporating hands-on experiments, field trips, or guest speakers from the science community.
    - Highlight the role of teachers in explaining the importance of science in a way that students can relate to and remember. This connects to making the content more relevant to their lives.

Remember, your potential as a writer is evident, and with continuous reading, writing, and exposure to English, your vocabulary and expression will improve.

However, there are areas for improvement to enhance clarity and coherence, ensuring your narrative effectively communicates your experiences and reflections.

1. **Response to the Topic**: It appears your narrative aims to reflect on past memories, eliciting a sense of nostalgia. Ensure that the narrative directly addresses the prompt by clarifying the significance of these memories in relation to the topic. If the topic required a reflection on change, for instance, explicitly drawing connections between past and present experiences would strengthen the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay has a poetic feel, which adds to the nostalgic tone. However, this style sometimes leads to incomplete sentences and ambiguous phrases, making it difficult for readers to follow your narrative. For example, in your attempt to describe scenes from the past, some sentences lack clear subjects, confusing the storyline. Work on constructing complete sentences that contribute to the progression of your narrative, ensuring each sentence has a clear subject and verb, and contributes to the overall story.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view as the essay author seems reflective, focusing on personal memories. To make your perspective clearer, consider guiding the reader through your thoughts and feelings more explicitly. Sharing more about how these memories affect you now or what they mean to you can help clarify your point of view.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: While your descriptions vividly paint the scene of a past time, the essay would benefit from more detailed arguments or explanations that support your point of view or thesis. For instance, if your thesis is about the lost vibrancy of childhood places, include more comparisons or reflections on how these places have changed and why these changes are significant.

In summary, to improve your essay, consider revisiting your narrative with a focus on clarity, completeness, and coherence. Aim for a balance between poetic description and narrative structure. Ensure each sentence clearly contributes to your story and that your reflections on past memories are tied back to the essay’s main theme or topic.

Additionally, the another benefit of this is relating to how the company has to reduce their outcome, due to the fact that, the office should not be operate 24 hours per day. \n On the other hand, we can not deny that this technology improvement has some drawbacks too, owing to the fact that there also a job which force the labour to accomplish work in the office, in particular for a big company. For more detail, lets take an example on electronic services' companies. They tend to entire their time in the workplace because it it impossible to doing their job on the other places. That is why, I could say that the disadventages of this mobility are regarding to the effectiveness of workers time to make the problem clear. \n Clearly, there are some benefits from technology advances since it can makes some particular work became more flexible and highly producing. However, it also has brought a drawbacks as the work became disorganise.","Dear student, your essay is very weak. It does not really offer any solid evidence that the benefits of IT outweigh its disadvantages. You did present a discussion, but the evidence to support it was mostly general in nature instead of specific. In order to promote the idea that IT has more advantages, there needed to have been a specific mention of the IT methods or gadgets that make telecommuting a more advantageous method of working when compared to commuting to the office in order to perform work related tasks. You were supposed to also concentrate on technological innovations and not occupations such as painting. That does not require technology for its performance. That is not a telecommuting job that relies on technology. \n In your second paragraph, you assumed that the person will still need to go to the office to do work even with the gadgets available. Your discussion in this aspect is a prompt deviation and as such, forces your score to become even lower. The discussion in that paragraph is wrong because the given topic centers on only one premise which is <em>""Information technology enables many people to do their work outside their workplace""</em> . As such, you have proven that you did not understand the prompt and you do not have enough knowledge with which to properly discuss the topic. These are the reasons why I do not think you can score higher than a 3.","The essay addresses the topic of how technological improvements have impacted employment flexibility. However, the response to the topic could be strengthened by focusing more specifically on information technology (IT) and its direct effects on telecommuting rather than a broad discussion of technology. The mention of an artist completing work outside the office, for example, does not effectively illustrate the impact of IT since such work does not necessarily rely on technological advancements for remote completion.

There are spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues throughout the essay that need attention. For instance:
- ""bring"" should be ""brought"" (""technology improvement has brought a ripple effect"").
- ""outweight"" should be ""outweigh"" (""the merits...outweigh the drawbacks"").
- ""impovement"" should be ""improvement"" (twice mentioned).
- ""did not need to compel"" is awkwardly phrased and could be simplified to ""did not require"".
- Consider using ""an art company"" instead of ""art company"".
- ""another benefit of this is relating to how"" could be simplified to ""another benefit relates to how"".
- ""we can not"" should be ""we cannot"".
- ""lets take an example"" should include ""let's"" as the contraction for ""let us"" and could be more formally written as ""for example"".
- Watch for run-on sentences and fragment sentences; using transitional phrases and proper punctuation can improve the flow and clarity of the essay.

The essay's point of view is somewhat clear in that it favors the benefits of technological improvements on work flexibility. However, the arguments presented to support this viewpoint lack specificity and concrete examples. Focusing on specific IT tools or methods that enable telecommuting would provide stronger support for the thesis. For example, discussing how cloud technology, collaborative platforms, or specific software programs have transformed the ability to work remotely would be more relevant and persuasive.

The discussion on the drawbacks of technology is brief and lacks depth. Providing specific examples of scenarios where tech advancements may not contribute to job flexibility, such as jobs requiring physical presence or the potential for reduced collaboration and team cohesion, would offer a more balanced view.

In summary, the essay could be greatly improved by correcting language errors, providing specific examples of technology that facilitate remote work, and offering a more balanced discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of technological improvements in the workplace. Focusing on clarity, specificity, and thoroughness in argumentation will make the essay more compelling and effective.",2,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

People have different views about this transportation method. While some argue that it should not be used air transportation for this aim and its consequences is not acceptable, I believe that it could be a positive progress for us. \n There are various reasons why people believe that usage of air transport should not expand and it will have detrimental effects in the future. They may assert that this way of transportation would likely cause air pollution and Humanity will be exposed to many possible risks such as respiratory diseases. Moreover, this method of transmission is quite expensive and people in destination may buy the produces in higher fees compared to the source country. Besides, governments would usually take tax on export goods. Hence the prices of these products will highly rise and this increase would be difficult for average people to afford it. \n In spite of these drawbacks, I believe that this type of transportation could be mutually beneficial for exporter and importer. In my opinion, people receiving these agricultural products can benefit from them and they can have a wide variety of fruits or vegetables all the time. In addition, it can make more job opportunities in the country of origin and consequently, it would lead to economic growth in these countries. \n In conclusion, although it might appear air transfer is damaging and it is stated we should not use it, I personally think their benefits outweigh the disadvantages and it is a huge advance in our transportation system.","Dear student, one of the many problems that your essay possesses is that you did not compose an accurate prompt restatement. Now, without seeing the original prompt, which I wish you had posted instead of the shortcut instructions in the title box, I cannot give you an example of the proper content and format for the response. However, I can tell you that the mistake you made is in the discussion format method as indicated by your short instruction mentions. \n Instruction: Discuss both points of view and your personal opinion \n Response: While some argue that it should not be used air transportation for this aim and its consequences is not acceptable, I believe that it could be a positive progress for us. \n As you can see, your discussion restatement is the main mistake that you created in this paragraph. You deviated from the prompt discussion which should have only stated that you will discuss both points of view and then your personal opinion. Instead, you presented an analytical opinion essay with a direct response. Two actions that are not done in an opinion discussion essay. Read the other samples here to get an idea of how to more accurately create a prompt paraphrase. \n While your second paragraph is complete in terms of the sentence requirement, all you have presented here are reasons without explanations.

Reason for this belief \n 3. Supporting sentence \n 4. Example \n 5.

However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of the argument.

1. **Response to the Topic**: While the essay attempts to discuss both viewpoints and the author's opinion, it would benefit from a clearer introduction that explicitly states the intention to examine both perspectives before revealing the personal viewpoint. Avoid jumping directly into an analytical stance in the introduction. Instead, succinctly mention that the essay will explore both sides of the argument and conclude with a personal opinion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: The essay contains a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as ""many crops such as fruit and vegetables is significantly transferred..."" which should be ""...are significantly transported..."". Attention should also be given to agreement between subject and verb, and the use of singular and plural forms. Additionally, transitioning between paragraphs and arguments could be smoother and more logical.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The essay presents the personal opinion that the benefits of air transportation of agricultural products outweigh the disadvantages. However, this stance could be emphasized more strongly by directly connecting each argument back to how it supports the author's viewpoint.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay lists arguments but often fails to fully develop or support these claims with examples and explanations. Each paragraph discussing a viewpoint should start with a clear topic sentence, followed by a reason, supporting detail, an illustrative example, and an explanation of how the example supports the reason. Rather than merely listing potential issues or benefits, delve deeper into why these points matter and how they directly relate to the broader argument about air transportation of agricultural products.

5. **Structure and Organization**: To improve the organization, consider restructuring the essay as follows:
    - Begin with a clearer paraphrase of the topic and a brief overview of the intentions to discuss both viewpoints plus a personal opinion.
    - For each viewpoint (against and for air transportation), dedicate a paragraph that includes a topic sentence, a reason, supporting evidence, an example, and an explanation. This will provide a more comprehensive and engaging argument.
    - Clearly state your personal opinion in a separate paragraph, ensuring to support it with reasoned arguments and examples.
    - Conclude with a summary that encapsulates the discussion, reiterates your personal stance, and offers a closing thought or a call to action.

By focusing on these improvements, the essay will not only become more coherent and engaging but will also more effectively communicate the complexities and nuances of the issue at hand.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Since some of juvenile are not interested in academic schools, they prefer to choose internship or learning under company under school regulation, resulting better distribution of labor. Additionally, it could rise the number of investments by multinational company to country so It establish job field for the nation. For instance, Indonesia, which is categorized as one the most populated countries, implemented both of these school to provide different characteristics student since 40 years ago. if this programm consistently held by local government, it will increase the amount of capital flow to Indonesia by doubled. \n Due to some issue inequality in new industrial country, government build vocational school to solve this problem. This is supported by the capable of this school to create hard skill and soft skill for the youngster, making a better-off condition for village in term of skill full labor. For example, Gunung Kidul government, which is established village-owned enterprise, has successfully collaborated between local academy and enterprise institution to create real-practice studies for underprivileged society in the past 2010. From the research conducted by the host universities in 2019, showed the increasing of disposable income received by pupil after four years studying in this collaboration. \n The widely spread of theory and practice-based school in certain region are beneficial for the improvement of productivity and rising the rate of income for isolated cities.

Now, the writer laid out reasons for the existence of rach, but focused only on the vocational discussion throughout the presentation. Such an viror in discussion created an inbalance and lack of proper s development. The academic defense is nowhere to be found. \n The discussion is only partially responsive and will only recieve a partial score due to missing discussion references.","The essay provides a detailed exploration of the benefits of academic and vocational schools in certain countries, focusing predominantly on how vocational schools can improve the workforce and societal wealth. The choice to highlight the impact of vocational education, especially in underdeveloped and new industrial areas, is insightful. Indeed, the inclusion of examples like Indonesia and Gunung Kidul adds depth to the argument.

However, while the essay begins by mentioning both academic and vocational education routes, the subsequent discussion primarily focuses on vocational education. This creates a noticeable imbalance as the potential benefits and importance of academic education are not explored in depth. To strengthen the essay, it would be beneficial to discuss how academic education also contributes to the workforce and society. This balanced approach would ensure a complete exploration of the topic, as initially proposed.

There are a few areas where attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic elements is needed to enhance clarity and readability. For example, phrases like ""Both of scheme bring prime benefit"" could be revised to ""Both schemes bring prime benefits."" Paying attention to pluralization and article use can significantly improve the essay's professionalism. Additionally, sentences beginning with ""Since some of juvenile"" and ""For instance, Indonesia, which is categorized as one the most populated countries,"" could be clarified for better impact. Consider revising to ""Since some juveniles"" and ""For instance, Indonesia, categorized as one of the most populated countries.""

The point of view is clear; the essay advocates for the value of vocational education. However, including a balanced argument for academic education would clarify the position further and make a stronger case for the importance of both educational paths in national development.

To enhance the arguments made, consider integrating more specific examples and statistics related to both academic and vocational schooling outcomes. Comparing these could provide a fuller picture and reinforce the thesis. Moreover, ensuring that each paragraph introduces and explores a unique idea will improve the essay's structure and coherence.

In the following paragraph, I will discuss what could be the best possible teaching method for parents. \n Firstly, there are a lot of studies that show it counts as forbidden to hit the child if he/she did something bad. It could leave a lot of memories to scar them for life or even hold them back when they get older. \n Secondly, one of the important roles of parents is to guide their children and prepare them for future. In addition, they must figure out a way to remain in control so that kids listen to their words and accept them. For instance, one of my family has a child who does whatever he wants and never reacts to the word ""don't"". he does not care if it comes from his parents or someone else. I think he will become spoiled in the future and also there is a possibility of hurting himself. \n Lastly, there are a lot of ways to control children, but the crucial point is to stay fair. I mean sometimes just a talk can teach so many things. For example, I remember when I was a child, my parents used grounding as a method of control or sometimes they just banned the objects which caused the problem, like a toy gun. I believe it is a healthy attitude toward children because they both understand they did something bad and also respect more the freedom they had before. \n In conclusion, parents are allowed to punish their children, as a matter of fact, it is their responsibility.

Nevertheless, there are several areas where improvements can make the essay stronger and more aligned with the requirements of a high-quality English proficiency test essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your introduction does not fully set the stage for an argumentative discussion on the methods of disciplining children. Consider introducing the topic by acknowledging the debate around punishment and discipline, and stating your position more clearly.

This approach can offer a clearer foundation for your argument and ensure the essay directly addresses the topic.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** The essay contains some grammatical errors and stylistic inconsistencies that obscure clarity. Pay attention to proper subject-verb agreement, the use of articles, and the correct pluralization of nouns (""parent's"" should be ""parents’"" when indicating possession by more than one parent). Additionally, aiming for variety in sentence structure can enhance the readability of your essay. 

3. **Author’s Point of View:** Your stance on the issue is somewhat clear, but it could be expressed with greater conviction. In your introduction, explicitly state your viewpoint to give your essay a strong, persuasive edge. It’s important for readers to grasp your perspective from the beginning.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You provide examples and reasons why physical punishment may not be ideal and suggest alternative disciplinary methods, which strengthens your essay. However, your arguments would benefit from more specific evidence or references to studies, as well as a deeper discussion on the psychological impact of different disciplinary approaches. Additionally, discussing both sides of the argument, even if you favor one, could provide a more balanced essay and fulfill the task requirements more effectively.

To make this essay more effective, here are specific points of feedback aimed at improving both the structure and content of your submission:
 
1. **Relevance to the Topic:**
   - The focus of the essay seems to diverge from a direct response to the specific prompt provided. Make sure to clearly understand the prompt and directly address it in your essay. For instance, if the prompt asks about the effects of social media networks or online banking, ensure your discussion centers around these themes. Tailoring your essay to directly respond to the prompt is crucial for meeting the expectations of the assignment.
 
2. **Introduction and Thesis Statement:**
   - The introduction would benefit from a succinct summary of the topic and a clearly stated thesis statement directly responding to the prompt. Instead of mentioning ""I'll explain my reasoning..."" it would be more effective to integrate your main argument or opinion related to the prompt directly in the opening paragraph. This will guide the reader and set a clear direction for the essay.
 
3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   - Watch out for spelling and grammar mistakes as they can detract from the clarity and professionalism of your essay. Consider using tools or asking for help to proofread your work. Additionally, aim for a formal tone throughout the essay, avoiding conversational language to maintain academic professionalism.
 
4. **Clarity of Position:**
   - Your stance on the issue is generally clear, but you could strengthen this by providing a direct statement of your position earlier in the essay. This ensures the reader is not left guessing about your viewpoint.
 
5. **Supporting Arguments:**
   - It's important to back up your position with clear and descriptive arguments. While you mention the risks of identity theft and scams, diving deeper into these topics with specific examples or data would reinforce your argument. Also, exploring both sides of the argument, including potential counterarguments and rebuttals, can add depth to your essay.
 
6. **Conclusion:**
   - Finally, reinforce your main points in the conclusion to leave a lasting impression on the reader. Summarize your argument succinctly and state why it is important to consider the risks of sharing personal information online.
 
By focusing on these aspects, you can significantly improve the coherence, relevance, and persuasiveness of your essay.

That leads to a lack of clarity and a failure of cohesiveness and coherence in your presentation. You should be concentrating on fully explaining your reasons and solutions instead of just fulfilling the discussion requirements by the number of reasons and possible solutions in your paragraphs. The key to passing this test is in the way that you prove to the examiner that you can understand the topic and provide fully developed explanations to support your reasoning statements.

This is a key strength as you have immediately engaged with the topic. However, to improve the essay, focus should be placed on not just listing reasons and solutions but on expanding upon these with well-developed explanations. 

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay does address the topic by acknowledging the problems caused by an increase in cars and proposing solutions. To enhance your response, consider implementing a structured approach in each paragraph that includes:
   - A clear topic sentence to introduce the main idea.
   - A concrete example illustrating your point.
   - An explanation that connects the example back to the topic, illustrating why it is relevant.
   - Additional support or explanation that firmly establishes your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are several instances where the language can be made clearer and more grammatically accurate. For instance, the phrase ""The considerably increasing of cars"" could be revised to ""The considerable increase in cars."" Pay attention to verb tense consistency and the correct use of articles. Moreover, sentences like ""It's can contribute to the rising sea levels"" should be revised to ""It can contribute to rising sea levels."" Keeping sentences clear and concise will help avoid confusion.

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:** Your point of view is clear: you recognize the problem and suggest solutions. However, connecting your arguments more cohesively will strengthen this. In the solutions paragraph, placing your example earlier and dedicating space to fully explain how it supports your reasoning would improve clarity and impact.

4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence:** Where you excel in identifying causes and suggesting solutions, there's room to deepen the connection between these elements. In the paragraph discussing the negative effects of car proliferation, aim to directly link environmental issues to human health impacts in a way that's easy to follow. Using a unified or progressively detailed example would make the connection between car increase, environmental damage, and human health clearer and more impactful.

Finally, your concluding paragraph could better serve your essay by succinctly recapping the main issues and solutions discussed. This would provide a sense of closure and reinforce the key points of your essay, bringing your argument full circle.

They are to young to see things in TV that have a lot of persuasion and could influence those young children in a bad manner. \n Children at that age (two to five) do not distinguish between good and bad things. For example, any children should watch advertising about cigarettes or alcohol. Those advertisings' consumers are parents or people over 18 that can purchase them. A child could misunderstand the message of the advertising and can have more probabilities to consume cigarettes and alcohol when they grow up. \n In long term, children could become aggressive. There are a lot of advertisings about not driving after consuming alcohol or drugs, about where to call if a woman is suffering violence at home, or even about series that involve discovering who murder somebody. This all advertisings will affect the children's brain and maybe when they grow up they could have more chances to be aggressive with their wife, to drink and drive after or to murder somebody. \n For those reasons, I think that television advertising should be prohibited for children from two to five years old. Their subconscious could absorb bad messages and that could affect in their behavior at school, university and life in general.","Your essay needs to lower its discussion. It is too morbid for a topic that simply asked if you agree that advertising directed at children age 2-5 should not be allowed. Your reasons are not related to childhood understanding. You are discussing this as if the children have already become adults. That is not the scenario presented in the essay. Advertising directed at children are shown at a specific time, when children are watching. Adult commercials are shown during prime time, or when only adults are watching. \n The discussion for this essay should have focused on simpler considerations. The simpler considerations are how children could ask parents to buy toys, clothes, and other accessories their parents cannot afford, children could see the financial discrepancy in their lives when there are things like kiddie vacations being advertised that their parents cannot bankroll, simpler stuff related to the whims and caprices of kids. Nobody needs to be discussed in a violent form in your discussion. It really threw the essay off the mark. Stick to the effect on the child, not the future effect on the the adult who was a child.","The essay effectively addresses the prompt by taking a clear stance against television advertising directed at young children, arguing that it should not be allowed.

1. **Relevance to Childhood Understanding**: The points made should directly relate to the immediate impact of advertising on young children, focusing on understandable concerns for the age group of two to five years. It's important to steer the discussion towards how advertising influences children's desires and perceptions in the present, rather than discussing potential future behaviors as adults. For example, consider how advertisements might lead children to incessantly request toys, clothes, or trips from their parents, which could have immediate implications for family dynamics and children's understanding of financial limitations.

2. **Tone and Content**: The content of the essay veers towards discussing extreme and morbid scenarios that are less relevant to the immediate effects of advertising on young children. Instead of focusing on possible aggressive behaviors or severe future consequences, the essay would benefit from examining the more immediate and observable impacts of advertising, such as creating unrealistic desires or contributing to feelings of inadequacy among children when they compare themselves to what they see in advertisements.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay (""to young"" should be ""too young"", ""children should watch"" likely intended as ""children shouldn't watch"", etc.) that can hinder clarity and flow. Additionally, consider breaking long sentences into shorter, clearer ones and ensuring that possessive forms are correctly indicated (e.g., ""advertisings'"" should be ""advertisements'"").

4. **Point of View Clarity and Argument Support**: While the essay's point of view is clear, supporting arguments can be enhanced by grounding them in more directly related examples and evidence. More specific and less severe examples of how advertising affects children would strengthen the essay. Citing studies or statistics on how advertising impacts children's behavior and self-perception could also lend credence to the position taken.

In revising the essay, focus on aligning the discussion more closely with the immediate effects of advertising on young children's perceptions and behaviors, clarify and correct language issues, and use relevant, child-focused examples to support your arguments. This approach will help create a more impactful and persuasive essay that directly addresses the essay prompt.",3,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative
4417,https://essayforum.com/writing/growth-internet-makes-easier-purchase-goods-93257/,test,The growth of the Internet makes it easier to purchase goods online. Discuss pros and cons.,"Nowadays, the growth of the Internet makes it easier to purchase goods online, from books, tickets to groceries, etc. Even though there are some disadvantages of buying things on the Internet such as scammers, and goods are not strictly controlled by the government, the benefits of purchasing things online are overweighed. \n Scammers are one of the biggest problems when buying things online. When you look at online stores, many stores don't have certifications or physical addresses. They can sell things from their basement, their home, and the customers can not know. As a result, they can easily sell low-quality, fake products to the consumers without being caught, and the buyers can not do anything except leave bad comments. The sellers just make another account and the sequences continue. Moreover, the government can not control the sellers strictly. Online markets such as Lazada, and Shopee give the sellers the power to be unknown. They can erase their online footprint, which makes it the government so hard to find out where they are and how they get the goods. \n On the other hand, there are many advantages when come to shopping online. The best benefit is convenience. Buyers do not need to go anywhere, they can just stay at home, surf the Internet, and find a store that allows online purchases. For instance, a man from Vietnam can buy a pair of shoes from the USA without leaving his flat. Moreover, the products sold online are usually cheaper. Online shopping makes it easier for the sellers to reach out to the ideal customers so that the prices are usually lower. \n From my point of view, the benefits of buying things online are outranked the disadvantages. There are some ways to prevent bad things happen when shopping online such as examining the products before paying, checking the reviews, or only purchasing products from legal stores. It is necessary to add the point that the Internet is growing significantly, and at some points in the future, online shopping will be the main way to buy goods.","Okay, if this is the first essay you have ever written for the Task 2 portion of the test, then I can understand why the writing is confused and does not follow the required discussion parameters for the instructions provided. Kindly remember to time yourself while writing the practice essays. Set the timer to 40 minutes then write. You will find that between brainstorming, outlining, drafting, reviewing, and finally, editing the paper, you will not have time to write 346 words. The ideal is 250-300 words at all times. It is the magic number for the time provided. \n The one thing that you did right, although not in perfect English sentences, is the writing of the prompt restatement + writer's opinion. It was on track, provided an insight into the incoming discussion as it relates to the writer's opinion, and clearly represents the upcoming discussion. While the sentence structure and word usage has problems throughout the essay, I have to say that the writer was still able to provide explanations clearly, without confusing the reader. \n As for the problems in the writing, the scoring will be limited to that of an under developed essay presentation due to the incorrect discussion format used. Comparison essays are only used when the instruction is "" Discuss both views"" . It cannot be used anywhere else. For this particular discussion the writing should have focused on representing how disadvantages are actually advantages. The format is: \n Sentence 1: Disadvantage subject \n Sentence 2: Explain the disadvantage \n Sentence 3: Oppose the disadvantage \n Sentence 4: Explain why it is an advantage \n Sentence 5: Use a relevant example to close the paragraph. \n The same format may be used for an ""advantage is a disadvantage"" discussion as well. This is the format the examiner is looking for. This is the discussion that will be considered a fully developed presentation since there will be 2 paragraphs that discuss the topic in the same format. There will be a cohesive discussion present. \n The writer also needs to familiarize himself with the concluding summary presentation. A personal opinion in the final paragraph is considered a non-concluding presentation. The result of which will be failing overall score because the writer did not complete the test with the presentation of a concluding reverse paraphrase. \n Is there a chance the examinee can achieve his target score? Definitely. He shows a good grasp of the topic, which I hope will be the same for other topics in the test. By further developing his English sentence structure skills and working on providing the correct discussion format per essay instruction, he can slowly work his way towards meeting his ideal score.","The essay effectively engages with the topic of online shopping, weighing its advantages against its disadvantages. However, it's crucial to adhere to the task requirements more closely, particularly regarding the word count and response structure, to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test.

Firstly, focusing on word count, aim for a more concise presentation of ideas, targeting 250-300 words. This brevity ensures that each word serves a purpose and contributes directly to your argument, helping maintain clarity and focus throughout.

Secondly, the introduction does a commendable job of setting up the discussion and presenting a personal viewpoint. Nevertheless, enhancing sentence structure and word choice throughout the essay would further improve readability and coherence. Precise and clear language is essential for conveying your message effectively, particularly in an academic or formal context. 

Regarding essay structure, the current approach of listing disadvantages and advantages separately could be refined. The task requires a nuanced discussion that directly connects disadvantages to their corresponding advantages, rather than discussing them as separate entities. This involves stating a disadvantage, explaining it, opposing it with an advantage, elaborating on why it is, indeed, an advantage, and reinforcing the argument with a relevant example. This method ensures a more cohesive and compelling argument, demonstrating a deeper analysis of the topic.

Additionally, the conclusion would benefit from a more structured summary that strengthens your overall argument. Avoid introducing new personal opinions in the closing paragraph. Instead, aim to concisely recap your key points, ensuring a strong, resolute finish to your essay. This helps solidify your stance and ensures the essay feels complete.

Finally, continuous practice with a focus on these areas, especially improving sentence structure and adhering to the specified discussion format, will significantly enhance essay quality. Understanding and applying the correct structure for different types of essays is crucial for success in English proficiency tests. With diligence and focus on these aspects, there's a clear path toward improvement and achieving the desired test score.",4,3,3,4,4,3,3,4,3,1,Argumentative

However, some individuals believe that inventions such as dishwashers and computers, which were developed to save time and improve communication, only make daily routines harder and stressful. \n To begin with, the lack of knowledge of some people to understand state-of-art devices' functionalities is the main reason for complaints. Some persons have immense difficulties to deal with technology because they were not used to live with it. As a result, they fell stressed for not having such an important ability. For example, my mother used to work as a secretary using basically telephone and paper. Nevertheless, computers, smartphones, and other equipments of communication were introduced in her work routines and she did not have conditions to sharpen her skills, which led her to lose great job opportunities. Therefore, like many other individuals, she believes that modern tools only increase her stress levels. \n However, it must be pointed out that for who have a busy lifestyle household devices and communication tools are fundamental. Washing clothes, making dishes, booking appointments, buying products are some day-to-day activities that became easier after the invention of advanced machines.

In addition, she can make use of communication devices to solving personal problems such as to communicate with her children's school, sparing her free time to spend with her family. Hence, other people like my sister argue that these technological improvements reduced considerably their stress level. \n In conclusion, technology has to be seen as beneficial. Although some people, who struggle to update their technological knowledge, think in the opposite way, devices such as dishwashers and computers have provided people with more time for entertainment as well as facilitated their ways of communication and work.

A clear and concise statement of your position at the beginning or end of your introduction would help clarify your stance on whether you believe technology reduces or increases stress.

2. **Refine Your Use of Language**: Avoid using phrases like ""To begin with"" and ""However"" as crutches to start your paragraphs.

3. **Be Concise**: Aim for brevity in your writing. An effective essay can articulate its main points within 290 words, focusing on the essential arguments without relying on too many examples or unnecessary elaboration. This means striving for no more than five sentences per paragraph and employing a range of punctuation to connect your ideas smoothly.

4. **Grammar and Style Notes**:
   - Be mindful of word choice, especially with non-count nouns. For instance, ""equipment"" should not be pluralized. 
   - Pay attention to punctuation usage, including commas, semicolons, and periods, to vary your sentence structure and clarify your ideas.

While the bulk of the general public regards it as a beneficial tendency for the world of sports, others are concerned about its demerits. This essay will examine both standpoints before concluding that I side with the former. \n On the one hand, there are several downsides associated with companies sponsoring sports. Chief among them is the potential that financial gain may overshadow the core values and traditions of the sport. Consequently, the rectitude of the sport may get doubted by its fans. To illustrate, the recent commercialization of the FIFA World Cup 2022, the most prestigious football tournament, has faced criticism from football fans as the tournament has accepted sponsorships from corporations with records of violating human rights, causing doubts about the event's genuineness. \n On the other hand, business sponsorship has positive impacts on the sports sector. As sponsorship provides much-needed financial support to sports teams and events, which can help them improve facilities and equipment for athletes. As a result, their players can maintain the best form and achieve several titles for the clubs. For example, the multi-million-dollar deals between City Football Group and Manchester City have provided the players with state-of-the-art gym centres and cutting-edge training facilities. As a result, the club has reaped titles and broken records in recent years. \n In conclusion, although corporate sponsorship in sports is advantageous, I assume these aids may excessively commercialize the world of sports given the disputes around the FIFA World Cup 2022.","<quotation>This essay will examine both standpoints before concluding that I side with the former.</quotation> \n You are not going to receive a score for merely restating the discussion instructions and then giving an irrelevant opinion.

That way you will achieve a proper score based on a completely developed restatement + writer's opinion + thesis statement.

The writer does not fully develop his personal opinion based on each public opinion. He must discuss his opinion of each public opinion to show that he understands the basis of each reason, but that he disagrees or that he agrees with it based on related reasons. \n 3. The writer's opinion is not properly presented in this essay given that it was presented as a part of the concluding paragraph. This will lead to an open ended essay, which always results in an automatic failing score since there is no proper summary conclusion presented.","This essay tackles the topic of sports sponsorship, discussing both its benefits and drawbacks, and concludes by siding with the perspective that sees corporate sponsorship in sports as largely beneficial. However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to better meet the expectations of an English proficiency test.

Firstly, the introduction needs to be stronger and more directly related to the essay's main argument. Instead of simply stating an intention to explore both standpoints, it would be beneficial to also include the reasons behind siding with one standpoint over the other. This approach not only clearly states the essay's thesis but also frames the discussion that will follow, providing a roadmap for the reader. 

Regarding the essay's structure and argument development, there is room for improvement in presenting personal opinions more effectively. Each section discussing the public opinion could be strengthened by adding a more detailed exploration of the writer's own viewpoint regarding each argument presented. This means not just stating that there is agreement or disagreement with a particular standpoint, but also explaining why, based on the evidence or reasoning provided. This approach ensures a deeper engagement with the topic and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the issue being discussed.

Furthermore, the conclusion of the essay does not fully encapsulate the discussions that preceded it. For a more effective conclusion, it's crucial to restate the thesis in light of the discussions made, summarizing the key points that led to the final position. Presenting the writer's opinion only at the end, without clear ties to the previous discussion, may leave the essay feeling unresolved. Instead, summarize the arguments and explain how they support the conclusion drawn, providing a clearer and more decisive ending to the essay.

On a stylistic note, the essay could benefit from a more varied vocabulary and sentence structure to convey ideas more vividly and keep the reader engaged. Additionally, ensuring that the essay consistently uses the correct third-person pronouns when discussing public opinions will improve its formal tone and clarity, adhering to academic writing standards.

Lastly, while the essay does a good job of using examples to support its points, these could be expanded upon with more detail or analysis to show how they directly support the essay's argument. This deepens the reader's understanding and makes the case being argued more convincing.

In summary, focusing on structuring the essay to include a clear, argument-based thesis statement, developing a more nuanced personal opinion, and ending with a comprehensive conclusion will significantly improve this essay. These changes, along with stylistic improvements, will enhance the coherence, persuasiveness, and overall effectiveness of the writing.",4,3,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

In my opinion, I completely disagree with this idea because of the potential lack of nutrition as well as hindered economic growth if people are concentrated to fulfill the need for self-reliance of food. \n It seems to me that if a country only consumes the types of food available to its region, people's demand for a wide range of nutrition can not be met, especially in a country with an extreme climate. For example, countries with continental climate like Russia can not grow staple crops like rice and need to import a large amount each year if they want to have it in their daily meal. Therefore, minimizing the food imported from other countries may be an extreme choice. \n Moreover, due to the disparity in technological resources, weather and geographical conditions, enormous manpower may be required to produce enough food. Many countries are not favoured with conducive factors for food production and this will result in a lack of human resources for other industries. Therefore, a deteriorating economy predicating on agriculture is anticipated. \n I understand those who argue that food transportation is a huge carbon burden. However, if a country wants to supply itself, it is likely that deforestation will expand to make way for agricultural land. In this case, there is no big difference regarding environmental cost and the farming practices per se also release a whopping amount of greenhouse gases. Take livestock farming as an example, enteric fermentation produces methane during digestion in ruminant animals like cows and this has done great harm to the environment. \n In conclusion, I completely disagree with the idea that a country should be independent of food due to the possibility of malnutrition, potential economic failure and the fact that it makes no big difference if we clear forests, conduct farming and transport food by plane.","Good work on the prompt restatement and writer's opinion paragraph.

It is based on a 2 reasoning discussion paragraph format. One paragraph for each thesis reason. The writer over extended the discussion. It could have been easily completed within 2 paragraphs based upon how short the third paragraph actually is. The use of concise paragraphs will always help the C+C score.

It helps to add to the strength of the discussion and will definitely help increase the GRA score since it removes any confusion about who is speaking in the essay. The sentences are well developed and understandable as well. The sentences are not perfect, but that is not the aim of the test. As long as the writer can produce sentences that help the reader understand his opinion, then the sentence and paragraph will have succeeded in accomplishing its task.","The essay begins with a strong introduction that clearly restates the prompt and presents the author's opinion effectively. This sets a positive tone for the essay and aligns well with the expected format, showcasing a clear stance on the topic right from the start. This strategy significantly contributes to a strong foundation for the essay.

However, it is important to improve the structure of the argumentation within the body of the essay. The essay extends over what could ideally be organized into two concise paragraphs of reasoning, as per the requirements of a typical discussion essay format. Instead, an extra paragraph has been added without substantial need, which dilutes the strength and focus of the argument. Condensing the discussion into two strong paragraphs, each dedicated to a distinct reason supporting the thesis, would not only enhance clarity but also adhere to the expected format, potentially improving the coherence and cohesion (C+C) score of the essay.

In terms of expressing personal viewpoints, the effective use of personal pronouns throughout the essay serves well to clarify the perspective and adds strength to the argumentation. This approach is commendable as it aids in eliminating ambiguity regarding the author's stance and promotes a more direct and engaging discussion. Further, the sentences across the essay are generally well-constructed and contribute to an understandable narrative. While perfection in sentence construction is not the ultimate goal, making sure that sentences effectively convey the author's standpoint is crucial, and in this regard, the essay succeeds.

Nevertheless, there are opportunities for improvement in spelling, grammar, and stylistic elements to enhance the overall quality. A careful review to correct minor errors and simplify complex sentences could make the essay more accessible, especially considering its audience of English language learners.

Additionally, while the author's viewpoint is clear, providing more specific, descriptive arguments with concrete examples could further strengthen the positions taken. This approach would not only support the author's viewpoint more convincingly but also enrich the essay's content.

In summary, refining the essay's structure by adhering to a more concise format, continuing the clear use of personal perspectives, and enhancing the specificity and descriptiveness of arguments can significantly improve the essay.

While the creative approach of using a dialogue to present different perspectives is commendable, there are several areas in need of improvement to effectively convey the message and engage the reader.

1. **Response to Topic:** The essay aims to discuss the value of part-time work in gaining experience and soft skills, a relevant topic. However, the connection to the main topic seems to lose focus at times. It would benefit from a clearer introduction that sets the stage for the dialogue, indicating the purpose of the discussion and the questions being addressed.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are some grammatical and stylistic inconsistencies throughout the essay. For example, varying tense and informal language (""I think it was a great way..."") may distract readers. Consider revising for consistent verb tense and a more formal tone appropriate for an essay. Also, make sure to clearly differentiate between the speakers and their arguments to avoid confusion.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** The essay presents a dialogue between characters with differing views on part-time work, yet it's not always clear whose perspective is being represented or the essay's overall stance on the issue. To improve, establish the speakers' viewpoints more distinctly at the beginning and ensure each contribution clearly supports or opposes the central argument.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay introduces arguments for and against part-time work, the reasoning and examples provided are somewhat superficial. Expanding on these arguments with more detailed examples, research, or personal anecdotes could strengthen the essay. Specifically, illustrating how part-time work in different settings (e.g., tutoring vs. working in a bar) contributes to skill development would offer a more comprehensive discussion.

To enhance this essay:

- Begin with a clear introductory statement that presents the debate topic and the speakers.
- Improve clarity and formal tone by revising for grammar, style, and consistency.
- Clarify and distinguish between each speaker's point of view and arguments.
- Provide deeper explanations and more concrete examples to support the viewpoints.

This feedback aims to guide improvements by focusing on specific areas such as clarity of argument, engagement with the topic, and the presentation of ideas.

I strongly agree with this statement because working without satisfaction leads them to feel a sense of pressure. \n On the one hand, recruiting employees who have no enthusiasm for work cannot help increase companies' growth. Instead, they would be their drawback. Because people who are unhappy with their jobs do not consider their development and avoid additional effort to take on extra responsibility. In this time, despite companies pouring money into the education of these workers, it cannot provide high efficiency because employees do not have an avid desire for career advancement in their field. This not only affects their own career prospects but also impacts the overall efficiency and productivity of the organization. In contrast, unemployment may provide individuals with the time and freedom to explore alternative career paths or pursue further education that aligns with their passions and interests. \n On the other hand, this kind of employee tends to feel a sense of stress or sadness due to dissatisfaction with their job. And it leads to chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart-related illnesses, and so on. For example, studies have consistently shown that workplace dissatisfaction is closely linked to increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression. In addition, workers always suffer from spending quality time with their relatives and families. Such situations occur, especially among unenthusiastic workers.

Any irrelevant paragraphs, those that do not support he discussion, not be considered nor given a score. Therefore, it is important that you keep your discussion aligned to the single opinion defense format. \n When a comparison essay is written in place of a single opinion, the examiner will reduce the score due to the non applicable paragraph and in the process, lacking word count. That means the essay will not receive passing marks.","The essay clearly states the topic and presents a strong opening with a clear stance on preferring unemployment over unenjoyable employment. This is an effective way to engage readers and set the foundation for the argument. However, to improve, it's important to ensure that all paragraphs directly support the initial stance without deviating into comparative discussions that might seem off-topic or irrelevant to the central thesis.

Firstly, on the aspect of responding to the topic, the essay does well by directly addressing the statement and providing a clear opinion. The thesis statement is strong, but the support throughout the essay should consistently reflect back on this thesis to reinforce the chosen stance.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay maintains a satisfactory level overall, but attention to smoother transitions between paragraphs, variety in sentence structures, and careful proofreading could further polish the writing. Variations in sentence length and structure can make the arguments more engaging and easier to follow.

The author’s point of view is clearly stated at the beginning, yet it becomes slightly clouded by attempts to cover opposing viewpoints in detail. Remember, in a single opinion essay, all content should reinforce the author's initial perspective. Additional viewpoints can be acknowledged briefly if they are immediately countered to support the original thesis.

In terms of developing clear and descriptive arguments, the essay introduces several critical points, such as the impact of job dissatisfaction on personal health and company productivity. These are strong points; however, ensure that each argument directly ties back to why unemployment might be preferable, enhancing clarity and efficacy. For instance, rather than broadly comparing employed versus unemployed individuals' lifestyles, focus on how unemployment can offer opportunities for personal development and alignment with true interests, which directly supports the thesis.

To further improve, it's advisable to avoid broad generalizations without evidence. For example, when discussing the negative health impacts of job dissatisfaction, referencing specific studies or data could lend more credibility to the claims. Additionally, the conclusion successfully reiterates the main points but could be enhanced by summarizing how unemployment offers a valuable break for self-assessment and pursuit of passion, aligning closely with the thesis and ensuring a cohesive ending.

In summary, while the essay effectively presents a viewpoint and provides relevant arguments, focusing on direct support for the thesis, careful proofreading, and deeper evidence-backed arguments can significantly enhance its coherence, persuasiveness, and overall impact.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4423,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-believe-studying-university-college-94577/,test,Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career,"Nowadays, a lot of teenagers are wondering whether to get a job straight after school or continue their education. There is no denying that getting a job straight after school is advantageous, yet I have a strong belief that studying at a university or college is the better selection. \n To begin with, I absolutely concur that people prefer getting a straight job without learning at either university or college because of some benefits they get. First and foremost, people will be quickly independent of their finances, which can help them make ends meet without their parents' support if they commence working at the age of 18. To elaborate, there are a variety of students who apply for jobs soon at their teenage age, so as to afford a living. Second, people who are genuinely passionate about working more than studying, are going to get opportunities for gaining experience and accumulating some exclusive skills which are essential and applied to their jobs. Besides, it can help them excel to get better promotions in their careers. \n On the other hand, I strongly believe that it will be dominant for students' career path if they go on studying. Specifically, some managers from companies require qualifications in order to apply for better positions in professional jobs. One of the most preferred certificates besides a Master's Degree is an English degree, which can prove that candidates have already passed the language barriers so that they can easily engage in confabulation without stuttering or having some hazardous issues. Additionally, obtaining certificates is a huge prominence in the résumé. Employers would like to prioritize a person who has experience, a knowledge foundation, works diligently, and can enhance their level without wasting time on training. \n To sum up, it is surely said that getting higher education neither in university nor in college is better than getting a straight job as soon as people have graduated from high school.","<quotation>are wondering</quotation> \n There is no wonderment present in the original prompt. The original sources are the opinions of people. 2 different opinions. Nobody was wondering about anything. That is a prompt deviation that altered the original content. Your rephrasing will receive a failing score. Your prompt restatement is faulty and does not accurately represent the 2 public points. Your opinion basis is also incorrect since it does not consider the 2 public opinions provided. The preliminary score for this essay will be a failing one. \n When it comes to the discussion paragraph, you also provide only your personal opinion of both topics. The expected response format requires you to present a personal opinion after you have explained the previous public perception. Otherwise, you will not have an opinion to oppose or support. \n Sadly, the incorrect paraphrasing and improper response format are the reasons the essay will receive a failing score.","Your essay addresses the critical decision teenagers face between starting work immediately after school and pursuing higher education. However, there are essential aspects that need improvement for a more effective argument.

1. **Addressing the Topic Accurately**: Your introduction suggests that teenagers are contemplating this decision, which deviates from the original directive that presents two distinct community viewpoints rather than a state of wonderment. It's vital to accurately represent these perspectives rather than introduce new scenarios. Focus on restating the original prompt more precisely to avoid misinterpretation.

2. **Representation of Opinions**: Your essay leans significantly on personal views without adequately representing the broader public opinions on the matter. While personal insights are valuable, the task requires an initial discussion of varied community perceptions before introducing your stance. Aim to first outline these differing viewpoints in a neutral manner before contrasting them with your perspective to maintain a balanced argument.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, your essay is well-composed, but there are instances where simpler language could benefit clarity. Consider revising complex sentences and checking for minor grammatical errors. For instance, ""concider"" should be spelled as ""consider,"" and phrases like ""it will be dominant for students' career path"" could be simplified for better understanding.

4. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your position in favor of pursuing higher education is clear, which is a strength of your essay. To enhance this further, it's important to frame your argument within the context provided by the given perspectives, ensuring your viewpoint emerges as a reasoned conclusion rather than an isolated belief.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: You've provided arguments in favor of both working immediately and pursuing further education, with particular emphasis on the latter's benefits like gaining qualifications and meeting employer expectations. Enhancing these points with more concrete examples or statistics could strengthen your argument. Consider including data or studies that support the idea that higher education leads to better job prospects or higher salaries.

6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion succinctly restates the main idea, which is effective. However, ensuring that the conclusion follows logically from a balanced presentation of both viewpoints discussed earlier will make for a more compelling argument.

Improving these areas will not only address the criteria more accurately but also enhance the persuasiveness of your argument. Remember, the goal is to present a well-balanced view before leading to your well-supported conclusion.",4,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Specifically, Economic progress serves as a foundation for overall societal advancement. They argue that economic progress leads to higher living standards, increased employment opportunities and improved infrastructure, thereby benefiting as a whole (good argument). Take ChinaChinese's prosperous economy as an example., China possesses per capital GDP ranked second in the world, reflecting consistently high living standards of people, and this progress also helps enhance China's standing in the global world, which attracts foreign investment. Therefore, economic growth has effective impacts on various aspects of life. \n On the other hand, advocates of the second view focus on the other types of progress, such as social and environmental progress, that are equally important for a country. Firstly, They argue that social progress plays an essential role in a robust social welfare system through promoting comprehensive healthcare, proper education, and social security programs. Additionally, environmental progress could address pressingserves as addressing issues, such as climate change and pollution. One example of effective environment governance can be witnessed in Norway, where people invest in renewable energy and environmental conservation efforts. This proactive approach has resulted in Norway consistently ranking high in global happiness and quality of life indexes. Thus, promoting social progress and environment growth have an effective impact on the advancement of the country. \n While both views have their merits, I support a balanced approach that the nation's goal is not only to foster economic growth but also to robust other forms of progress. To address the problem at the grass-root level, it is crucial that the government combine promoting economics and aiding public health initiatives in order to contributes to the prosperity economic and population's health. Beside that, the government needs to adopt a comprehensive approach to national development. \n In conclusion, a balanced approach to determine the nation's goal should entail combining economic progress and other forms of progress. The government should adopt a holistic approach to national development","You did a good job in the prompt restatement. It is on point and sticks close to the original.

However, there are several areas that can be improved for a more compelling and coherent argument.

1. **Response to the Topic and Author's Opinion:** While the introduction of different perspectives on progress is clear, the essay lacks a direct and explicit statement of the author's own opinion. It's important to clearly state your thesis or main argument in the introduction and then reiterate or summarize this stance in the conclusion. This will not only provide a clear position but also strengthen the overall coherence of the essay. Additionally, make sure to clearly justify your opinion with specific reasons or examples, especially towards the end of the introductory paragraph.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are a few errors that need attention:
   - The phrase ""ChinaChinese's prosperous economy"" seems to be a typographical error. It should be corrected to ""China's prosperous economy.""
   - The use of capital letters in ""They argue that social progress..."" is incorrect when starting a new sentence unless ""They"" is preceded by a full stop.
   - Consistency in terminology will improve your style, for instance, choose either 'economic progress', 'economic growth', or 'economic prosperity' and use it consistently throughout your essay.
   - Use more conjunctions to improve the flow between sentences and ideas for a smoother reading experience.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** The point of view is hinted at but not explicitly stated until too late in the essay. For a stronger argument, clearly articulate your stance in the introduction and use the body paragraphs to provide evidence and examples that back up this position. This will make your point of view much clearer to the readers.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The arguments presented are relevant and provide a good basis for the discussion. The examples of China and Norway are strong; however, the connection between these examples and the essay's main argument could be more explicit. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that states the main idea being discussed. This will help in making your arguments clearer and more persuasive. Furthermore, the conclusion must not only restate your opinion but also summarize the reasons and examples you have provided. This helps in reinforcing your argument and providing a rounded end to the essay.

In summary, focusing on explicitly stating and justifying your own position, attending to grammatical and stylistic coherence, and improving the clarity and support of your arguments will significantly enhance the quality of your essay.

However, while i accept that study from the past might not have any significant impacts, i would argue with the idea that historical educating is not valuable for people living in the current period. \n To begin with, studying history might not have any considerable influences to people nowadays. Due to the rapid development of technology, individuals are living in a modern world, in a civilized society. Additionally, people have to pay attention to other subjects or factors which might contribute to the world such as economy, health or lifestyles. Beside, historical events might not exactly real since it were written or modified by selfish individual or some religious groups. This might lead to misconception for people living in the present \n However, despite all of the drawbacks, i believe studying history is not a waste of time. First of all, thanks to many discoveries in the past, people are now having a great number of opportunities to create and develop their lifestyles. For example, the invention of penicillin have cured infections. Another reason is people can now trying to prevent conflicts, which they did in the past. For instance, now people know how horrendus is war, war is nothing but just violence and crimes. Therefore, they would try to avoid any conflicts. Finally, learning about the past can provide people with their national knowledge. Through learning about the past, people would know what their nation did to build, develop and protect. Therefore, individuals now would more proud of their nations and would be more enthusiastic in contributing to their countries. \n In conclusion, while there are some drawbacks of studying history, i believe that people should learn about the past since it will give people pride about their nations, and it will prevent people from making mistakes.","You should not be arguing in this essay.

However, you did not directly present that discussion, which was the requirement for the essay response. \n When it got to the discussion paragraphs, your opinion became further blurred. There is a lack of clarity in your presentation because you opted to weight the pros and cons of both sides rather than taking a solid stance based on a clear opinion.

However, it struggles with several aspects that are crucial for a well-developed essay, especially in response to a direct question like agreeing or disagreeing with a statement.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay meanders between both sides of the argument without choosing a clear stance. The prompt asks whether you agree or disagree with the statement about the necessity of learning historical events. It is essential to clearly present your opinion at the beginning and maintain this stance throughout the essay. Instead of weighing pros and cons equally, choose one side to support and focus on providing strong reasons and examples that align with your view.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
There are several areas where your essay can improve in terms of spelling, grammar, and style. First, remember to capitalize the word ""I"" and the first letter of sentences. Also, watch out for the correct use of words and phrases. For example, ""historical educating"" might be better expressed as ""historical education."" Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. These changes can significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
Your personal viewpoint becomes unclear due to the essay's structure, which tries to present both sides of the argument. For better clarity, after stating your opinion, each paragraph should contain reasons and examples supporting that opinion only. This clarity is essential for the reader to understand and follow your argumentation.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
While you mention several reasons why learning history is beneficial, these reasons need to be more focused and directly tied to your stance. Avoid discussing the opposing view unless you are refuting it to strengthen your own position. For instance, instead of stating that history might not be accurate due to being written by biased parties, focus on counterarguments that showcase how historical awareness teaches valuable lessons or prevents past mistakes from recurring.

In conclusion, for your essay to be more effective, it needs a clear stance in response to the essay prompt, improved grammatical accuracy, and well-structured arguments that convincingly support your viewpoint. Focusing on these areas will not only address the task more directly but also provide a solid foundation for your argumentation, improving the overall quality of your essay.

In the past, there were both positive and negative sides of living in small areas \n In my opinion, there were three main benefits. First and foremost, people help each other whenever they have difficulties. In some cases, arguments among members of a family are reconciled by their neighbors. Also, people find it comfortable to share and talk about funny things together. They can organize a meeting at weekends to discuss general problems of the area and how to deal with them. Second, fewer people may cause less crime and environmental pollution. As a result, it's easier to take over and manage a small village. \n However, I think living in little town has its own disadvantages. One of those is unpleasant feeling as people know each other quite well, which leads to leaking of private information. Sometimes, people find it inconvenient if their neighbors show too much interest in their family's problems. \n I believe the advantages of staying in a small community are over the disadvantages. Troublesome matters that affect people's private life are minor. Meanwhile, it's great to support each other in community so they can equally develop.

For starters, your opening statement is not only short of the minimum 3 sentence requirement, but it doesn't accurately restate the prompt at all. The prompt asks you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community. Your discussion however related to past negative and positive sides of living in small areas. Review the prompt requirement again and you will realize that you did not represent the prompt properly. What you decided to discuss, were the past reasons that created a positive and negative side to living in small areas. This is a prompt deviation because the prompt itself did not make any time distinction to make you discuss ""past"" ideas. Therefore, the discussion should be made regarding present time considerations. While your discussion was somewhat good, it suffered from under developed discussions in a few instances. Specifically in paragraph 3. The conclusion even worsened the problem because you decided to offer an opinion regarding the advantage and disadvantage of living in a small community. Since your opinion is not called for anywhere in the original instructions, you should not have presented it anywhere in the essay. This presentation made the conclusion flawed because you presented a new topic for discussion rather than simply concluding the essay in the expected summary method. It is because of these observations that I believe you cannot get a passing grade with this essay.","The essay attempts to discuss the pros and cons of living in small communities, yet there are notable areas for improvement to ensure it fully meets the prompt's requirements and effectively communicates the author's viewpoints. Here's a breakdown of constructive feedback to enhance the essay:

1. **Addressing the Topic:** The essay veers off the prompt's intent by focusing on the past experiences of living in small areas, rather than discussing the current advantages and disadvantages. The prompt does not specify a timeframe; thus, the discussion should be relevant to the present day. To improve, revise the introduction to directly state the current advantages and disadvantages of living in small communities, aligning closely with the prompt's question.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** While there are minor errors, the essay is generally understandable. However, increasing sentence variety and ensuring more complex sentence structures could enrich its readability and engagement. Paying attention to punctuation, especially in compound and complex sentences, will also aid clarity and flow.

3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The essay author's perspective becomes clear towards the conclusion; however, the essay could benefit from a clearer stance throughout. It's vital to assert the author's viewpoint clearly in the introduction and continuously support it with arguments throughout the essay. Refrain from introducing new opinions in the conclusion that were not previously discussed.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The essay mentions some advantages and disadvantages but lacks depth in exploring these points. For instance, while it touches upon community support and environmental benefits, these discussions could be expanded with more examples or evidence. The mention of privacy concerns in small towns is a start, but further elaboration is needed. To strengthen your essay, each advantage and disadvantage mentioned should be accompanied by detailed explanations or examples. This approach will help in developing a more compelling and persuasive argument.

5. **Conclusion:** The current conclusion introduces the author's personal opinion, which diverges from the expected summarization of the essay's main points. The conclusion should recapitulate the mentioned advantages and disadvantages, reaffirming the thesis without introducing new ideas. This will provide a coherent closure to the essay.

By addressing these areas—ensuring relevance to the prompt, enhancing grammatical and stylistic quality, clarifying the viewpoint, enriching argumentation, and revising the conclusion—the essay can become more effective and aligned with the expectations of a proficiency test.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

I personally believe that the combination of cooperation and competition sense should be the important things in emphasizing a leaders' charachter in every individual. \n It is undeniable that a competition is a good thing for student, and it has obviously been applied in school. For example, there is a rank system that will encourage students to get a higher score than their friends. In addition, there are also many competition in extracurricular activities, such as in sports or games. By training youth with competition, they will be encouraged to focus on achieving their goals and forcing themselves to get the best result.

In workplace, they will have a willingness to work, not only work, but achieve the best things that will be beneficial to their institutions. \n Absolutely, the competition is not a single thing that determine people to be success. They also should have an ability to work in team. None can do such a lot of works in gaining the highest goals by her/himself alone. A great work will be successfully achieved when there is a great work team behind it. Therefore, every single individual should have a sense of cooperation, beside their competitive trait. \n By combining both competition and cooperation, everyone is able to be a competent leader and give a greater benefit for their institutions.

However, there are areas for improvement to ensure the essay aligns more closely with the expectations for a GRE test and to enhance its overall quality. 

First, it's crucial for the essay to directly address the topic. The initial paragraph introduces the idea of combining competition and cooperation to develop leadership skills but lacks a clear stance. The GRE essay requires you to choose a definitive position. Clarifying your viewpoint from the beginning will strengthen your argument.

Second, the essay encounters several linguistic issues, including spelling errors (e.g., ""charachter"" should be ""character,"" and ""thaught"" should be ""taught""), which could hinder its overall clarity and impact. Proofreading is essential to catch and correct these mistakes, ensuring the essay reflects a high level of academic English.

Third, the structure and development of arguments need refinement. Phrases like ""Some people argue that the best way is by training them a sense of cooperation in such a work team without a competition"" are somewhat confusing. Simplifying the language and being more direct can improve understandability. Instead, state the argument clearly and then explain or support it. For instance, ""Some argue that teaching cooperation without competition prepares youths for leadership. However, I believe that both elements are crucial."" This revision clarifies the standpoint and sets a foundation for further discussion.

The essay makes a significant point about the importance of both competition and cooperation in developing leadership qualities. However, it falls short in deeply analyzing these concepts and their impact. Introducing concrete examples or studies could enrich the argument, showing a more profound understanding of the topic.

Lastly, while discussing both competition and cooperation, the essay should balance these aspects and demonstrate how they interact to contribute to leadership development rather than separately stating their benefits. This approach will offer a more nuanced analysis and illustrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic, which is expected at the GRE level.

In summary, by choosing a clear stance, improving linguistic accuracy, simplifying the language for clarity, enriching the argument with deeper analysis, and integrating examples, the essay could be significantly strengthened. These adjustments will not only make it more suitable for the GRE but also enhance its overall persuasiveness and coherence.",3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

I partly agree with this argument. \n It is obvious that the more tourists visit the attractions, the more pressure the environment has to face. Littering is one of the main issues, which results from many overseas tourists' lack of awareness to put garbage in the right place. If monument management board do not have enough staff and expense to treat waste in time, it may cause air pollution and bad landscape.

1. **Response to the Topic:** You have indeed addressed the topic, presenting arguments for and against the idea of implementing higher fees for overseas travelers.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** There are a few spelling errors (e.g., ""Inequaliry"" should be ""Inequality"") and instances of grammatical errors that impact readability. The essay sometimes employs run-on sentences, which makes it hard to follow the points being made. Breaking down these sentences into shorter, more manageable ones can significantly improve clarity. Additionally, paying closer attention to proofreading could eliminate these errors and polish your writing. 

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your essay indicates a mixed viewpoint, suggesting that while there are benefits to higher fees for overseas travelers, there are also potential drawbacks. However, this stance could be stated more explicitly in both the introduction and conclusion to guide the reader more clearly through your discussion.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You have provided arguments to support your view, such as environmental concerns and the potential for negative perceptions among foreign tourists. However, these could be further strengthened with specific examples and more detailed explanations. For instance, mention concrete examples of ancient cultural architectures that have faced preservation challenges due to tourism. Additionally, discussing potential strategies for balancing the preservation of sites with the need to generate tourism revenue could offer a more holistic view.

5. **Improvement Suggestions:** To score better in sentence structure and vocabulary usage, try breaking down complex ideas into simpler sentences. This not only makes your essay more readable but also allows you to control the flow of ideas better. Regular practice with sentence structuring and embracing a habit of thorough proofreading can significantly diminish errors. Engaging with diverse reading materials can also help expand your vocabulary and expose you to various writing styles and structures, which can be beneficial for your writing skills.

In summary, the essay tackles an important issue with relevance to many countries facing the challenge of preserving their cultural heritage amid tourism demands.

How does this increase in the availability of information influence life in today's world?,"Invention of the internet, or more concretely, the World Wide Web, has affected human lives in tremendous ways. One of them is how easily can one access any kind of information nowadays. With that, however, come both positives and negatives, of which some of them I will address in the following paragraphs. \n To begin with the upsides, thanks to the internet existing, people are able to follow, and be aware of vast amount of events and news all over the world on-demand. They don't have to buy tabloids every morning, or watch newsflashes at a given time on the television. Instead, they can simply open the website of their favorite news magazine anywhere and anytime, as long as they have an internet connection. Therefore, having this kind of opportunities certainly encourages political activism and involvement of citizens in the public matters which is almost undoubtedly a good thing. For instance, in Slovakia, recent murder of an investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée stirred up the biggest public protests since decades, with people demanding transparent and thorough investigation, government resignation and passing of strict anti-corruption and anti-mafia laws by the parliament. \n In contrast, there are some downsides of widespread information availability as well. One of them, being unexpected growth of hoaxes and fake news spreading through the web. Large portions of internet users seem to fail to successfully distinguish actual facts and professional, sincere reporting from half-truths, propaganda or straight lies, which they encounter in the cyberspace. That may result into potentially harmful phenomena, such as current trend of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the belief that the vaccines do not work and cause autism, epilepsy and even death or recent rise in both on-line and off-line hatred towards individual ethnical groups as a whole based on exaggerating of isolated, anecdotal events and various conspiracy theories. Those can be nonetheless, at least partially dealt with by encouraging critical thinking and importance of facts and science in both child and adult population. \n To sum up, extensive expansion of using internet services among population comes as a mixed bag. Still, I believe that positives outweigh the negatives and the adverse effects of misinformation spreading over the web can be tackled rather effectively by the promotion of critical thinking and fact-checking in the educational process.","Dear student, the essay you wrote remained on target throughout most of your presentation. The positive and negative effects of the internet on the lives of people, focusing solely on information dissemination is good. However, it created a one sided essay that did not look into the other aspects of the internet effects on the lives of the public. For example, you could have discussed how the internet connected people via social media, but disconnected them as well because they no longer need to physically interact with people. In essence, this sort of question begs the writer to use a compare and contrast essay writing style in order to create a more informative and balanced presentation. \n The paragraphs are within the allowable limits with regards to the sentences. However, you have presented run on sentences in every paragraph because you kept using commas to connect what should have been separate idea discussions by trying to merge them into one sentence. While this may have served your purpose, it created confusing presentations that were difficult to follow topic wise and prevented you from creating coherent sentences. This made the cohesiveness of your paragraphs an issue as well. \n There is a difference between showcasing your advanced sentence development abilities, showcasing proper and complex usage of sentence structures with an impressive vocabulary when compared to what you developed, which are simple sentence presentations and adequate vocabulary skills presented in a misguided attempt to show off your intermediate and little edited English writing skills. \n Your concluding statement, by indicating \n <quotation>I believe that positives outweigh the negatives and the adverse effects of misinformation</quotation> \n created a prompt deviation. That is because the original discussion instruction required you to explain \n <quotation>How does this increase in the availability of information influence life in today's world?</quotation> \n . When you create an altered prompt statement, you will find yourself getting major points deductions because you changed the discussion theme towards the end or sometimes, at the beginning of the essay. \n These are the reasons why, even though your essay is strong in terms of content and information, it failed to make the proper impression in terms of presentation and discussion clarity.","The essay effectively addresses the impact of the internet, particularly the World Wide Web, on accessing information and its effects on society. It skillfully identifies both positives, like increased awareness and political activism, and negatives, such as the spread of misinformation. This focused approach is commendable. However, expanding the discussion to include other internet impacts, such as changes in social dynamics due to platforms like social media, would have provided a more comprehensive view.

Regarding structure, the essay is well-organized but relies heavily on long sentences connected by commas, leading to run-on sentences. These can make the essay harder to follow. Shorter sentences and clearer separation of ideas could improve readability and coherence. For instance, instead of merging several points with commas, break them into separate sentences or use connecting words like ""furthermore,"" ""however,"" or ""moreover"" to make transitions smoother between ideas.

The vocabulary and sentence structures show good command of the language but occasionally lean towards being simplistic. Striving for a balance between complex sentences and clarity can demonstrate advanced language skills without compromising the essay's readability. 

The conclusion shifts slightly from the essay's main discussion on the influence of information availability to a general evaluation of the internet's positives and negatives. Refocusing the conclusion to directly address the original question about the impact of accessible information on contemporary life would align more closely with the essay prompt and ensure the essay remains consistent in its purpose.

In future essays, consider varying sentence structure and using a mix of simple and complex sentences to engage the reader. Additionally, expanding the scope to consider a broader range of impacts and ensuring conclusions directly tie back to the essay question can strengthen the essay's effectiveness and relevance.",3,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Unemployment rates have been strikingly high in many countries due to computerization. Labors are freed from repetitive work and numerous occupations become outdated. On the other hand, thanks to medical advancement, people enjoy a longer life span, increasing expenses on pension for governments. It is no wonder why governments of several countries (Iceland, for example) went bankruptcy. \n When it comes to another major concern - environmental problems, over-population again should be blamed for. Global warming, caused by excessive gas emissions and over-reliance on air-conditioning, has led to the melting of glaciers and a rise in sea levels. This, of course, has a lot to do with a rising population who are indulged in modern conveniences. Also, animals are losing their habitats, making room for the humans and their concrete jungles. Consequently, species have gone extinct at alarming rate. \n Furthermore, over-population has contributed to many sensational political disputes. The need for petrol has been on the rise due to the demand of increasing drivers in both developed and developing countries. This, however, has caused conflicts between oil providers and buyers, bringing about sanctions and wars. Moreover, countries fight sovereignty of territories for interests and so-called well-being of their fast-growing population, at the cost of many innocent lives. \n In conclusion, the uncontrolled population has been the fundamental reasons of global financial, environmental and political problems. \n ---------------","You have not followed the correct format for the presentation of this essay. The first paragraph in a Task 2 essay is always used as a prompt paraphrase. That means, you deliver an explanation of the original prompt, including a response to the discussion question/s (when required), you do not change the prompt by creating an opinion essay from the very beginning. So, this essay will be seen by the examiner as having an inappropriate format. The proper rephrasing for this essay is: \n <em>The world is admittedly, beset with seemingly unsolvable complications. The reason being given for these problems is that these all stem from the overcrowding of the planet. I am strongly in favor of this belief due to a few considerations.</em> \n As you can see, your response is not proper. You have not answered the question provided in the original prompt. In the process, you have accidentally changed the discussion slant of the essay. That means, your response does not have a proper format. However, what I did see in the reasoning discussion is that your response has become partly correct. The only missing aspect? A proper response to the degree question. Had you done that, your essay would have had a better chance to score in a passing manner. \n The question is not whether you believe overpopulation is the cause of the world's problems. The question, is to what extent you agree with that given assumption? Your degree of (non) support should have been supported by 2 applicable reasons. Your essay did not meet these requirements and therefore, cannot get a passing score.","The essay tackles a significant and complex issue – overpopulation – pinpointing it as the root cause of various financial, environmental, and political problems faced by the world today. This focus on overpopulation is pertinent and aligns with topics often discussed in English proficiency tests. However, to improve the essay and align it more clearly with typical testing requirements, there are several key areas to work on:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay jumps directly into arguing that overpopulation is the fundamental issue behind many global crises without initially rephrasing or presenting the given topic. To align with standard essay formats for English proficiency tests, it's crucial to start by paraphrasing the prompt. An opening along the lines of ""The world is admittedly, beset with seemingly unsolvable complications. The reason being given for these problems is that these all stem from the overcrowding of the planet. I am strongly in favor of this belief due to a few considerations,"" would set a more appropriate context. Directly paraphrasing the prompt ensures the essay accurately responds to the task.

2. **Structure and Format:**
The essay lacks the structured format of an English proficiency test essay. Typically, the first paragraph should introduce the topic and your thesis, followed by body paragraphs that support your thesis with reasons, examples, or explanations, and finally, a conclusion that summarizes your points. Ensuring the essay follows this format will make your argument clearer and more persuasive.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
The essay contains several spelling and grammatical errors that could be distracting to readers. For example, labor is spelled as ""Labors,"" and the article ""the"" is occasionally missing before nouns like ""financial crisis."" Additionally, some sentences could be simplified for clarity and effectiveness, aiding in the overall readability of the essay.

4. **Clarity of Point of View:**
While the essay strongly argues that overpopulation is at the core of many global issues, it does not specifically address to what extent this belief is held. English proficiency tests often ask you to discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with a statement. Clarifying whether you completely or partially agree and why would strengthen your position.

5. **Arguments and Support:**
The essay successfully identifies significant issues like financial crises, environmental degradation, and political disputes as consequences of overpopulation. However, it could further strengthen its point by providing more detailed examples, statistics, or studies. Also, directly addressing counterarguments could enhance the persuasive element of the essay.

In summary, focusing on restructuring the essay to include a clear introduction that paraphrases the prompt, ensuring the argument directly addresses the question asked, correcting grammatical issues, and strengthening support for your points, will significantly improve the essay. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to practice structuring arguments clearly and concisely, ensuring alignment with the task's requirements.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Especially, the damage will be more and more grave if they do exercise in a wrong way that lead to the muscle pain. As well as this, heart needs to work harder to pump blood to their brain. This is mainly because human body has limits and when they heart can't respond anymore, can cause negative effect, their body probably fall into a coma which is also a main reason of heart disease. For example, there are people, who choose to run as much as possible as a way of losing weight, but the result is that, they will possibly take all of these damages above or even die. \n Futhermore, the problem is not only badly impact on physic health but also cause serious mental health problem. For instance, being exhausted from getting out of breath, people will lose motivation to run their daily life. This mean that, productivity would certainly decline. Consequenly, too much exercises waste time and excessive consumption of one's energy, which can contribute to a poor health. \n In conclusion, I personally believe that the more doesn't mean better, it is wise for people if they decide to do exercise at a suitable intensity, which can brings the best result of working out.","To start with, the introductory paragraph needs to be made stronger. Your paraphrasing of the prompt is not adequate enough. It is too short and does not supply the reviewer with a reference as to the discussion outline that will be undertaken in the essay. An example of an improved paraphrased introduction would be as follows: \n <em>While has often been said that exercise is good for the health, recent exercise trends have shown that the opposite of this belief may also be true. There is a growing public opinion that too much exercise could also be bad for one's health. As an observer of the growing exercise trend, I tend to agree that too much exercise could have negative effects on health. I will discuss my reasons for supporting this belief in the following paragraphs.</em> \n Kindly take note of the length of the paraphrased introduction. It must be at least 3 sentences long, properly sum up the meaning of the prompt, and deliver your discussion points for the succeeding paragraphs. \n You need to practice dividing your paragraphs by placing a space between the discussion topics. The current format of the essay places undue stress on the reader's eyes. Keep in mind that you are also being scored on the presentation of the essay so make sure to add spaces to allow the reader's eyes to breath in between statements. It also helps in the comprehension of your work and allows the reader to easily refer back to certain information within the paragraphs. \n Make sure to write a full 5 paragraphs in order to deliver the required number of paragraphs. Each paragraph should have a minimum of 3 sentences, maximum of 5. You will need to adjust the content of your current paragraphs in order to meet this highly specific requirement of the writing task format. \n Please always remind yourself that your opinion is not considered the conclusion of the essay. Rather, it is considered either the 3rd of 4th paragraph. So that means you need to be able to provide acceptable information in support of your opinion.

However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance the clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of the argument.

1. **Introduction:** The introductory paragraph needs expansion. It's essential to provide a broader context and outline the main points that will be discussed in the essay. A more developed introduction sets the stage for your argument and engages the reader more effectively. For example, starting with a general statement about the benefits of exercise, followed by the increasing concern over the adverse effects of excessive exercise, and concluding with a thesis statement that presents your stance, can create a strong foundation for your essay.

2. **Paragraph Structure:** Adding clear spaces between paragraphs will improve the readability of your essay. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea, supported by examples or reasons. This spacing not only makes your essay more visually appealing but also helps the reader to follow your arguments more comfortably.

3. **Essay Format:** Expanding your essay to the recommended five paragraphs will enable you to cover the topic more comprehensively. Typically, an essay includes an introduction, three body paragraphs (each presenting a unique point or argument), and a conclusion. Ensure that each body paragraph contains 3 to 5 sentences to maintain an appropriate length and depth of discussion.

4. **Conclusion:** The conclusion should restate the main argument in light of the evidence you've presented throughout the essay. It's not merely a repetition of the introduction but rather a synthesis of your main points, leading to a powerful closing statement that reinforces your position on the topic.

5. **Clarity and Coherence:** It's vital to present your arguments clearly and coherently. Avoid complex sentence structures that might confuse the reader. Instead, aim for simplicity and precision in your language. Providing specific examples will also strengthen your arguments and make your essay more compelling.

6. **Grammar and Style:** Pay attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For example, ""too much exercises"" should be ""too much exercise"" (exercise is uncountable in this context), and ""their physic health"" should be ""their physical health."" Consistently reviewing your work for grammatical accuracy and stylistic consistency will significantly enhance the overall quality of your essay.

7. **Supporting Your Opinion:** Your opinion should be embedded within the body of the essay rather than solely in the conclusion. It's important to back up your viewpoint with valid arguments and evidence throughout the essay. This approach demonstrates critical thinking and strengthens your overall argument.

By incorporating these suggestions, you can improve the structure, clarity, and persuasiveness of your essay, making it more likely to achieve a higher score on English proficiency tests.

Why might this be the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative situation? \n It is widely acknowledged that possessing a home is more imperative than renting one in some countries. This essay will first outline the underlying causes of this phenomenon, before arguing that it is more of a positive development. \n Owning a place to live in can be attributed to two main reasons. First, it is a tradition that is passed down from generation to generation in many countries that house ownership is one of the most significant goals in one's life. So, this tradition is deeply ingrained in many people's awareness, owning a house symbolizes work, appearance, and power, which is always used to evaluate their lives. For example, men in China must at least have a house and a car to be able to marry their lover. Besides, a sense of stability as a result of this could make people think a homeowner is more important than renting one. Renting is synonymous with the high risk of relocating regularly to find another one because tenants often depend on the choice of their landlord, who decides to increase the rent or even ask the tenant to vacate the property at short notice. Therefore, possessing a home can solve this worry and provide a stable haven. \n I believe that the possession of a house is predominantly beneficial. One major advantage is that it lessens the numerous burdens that each person must bear. When having home ownership, people would not face difficulties with rental amounts, the worry of the landlord's decision, or lack of scorn from folks in the vicinity. As a result, this makes their life more effortless. For instance, in China or many countries, it is simpler for men to receive appreciation and start a family. Moreover, owning a home is synonymous with putting down roots in a community and becoming more invested in their surroundings. Solving home problems allows people to spend time on their passions, their beloved, and their work, and this brings a sense of contentment and happiness in their lives. This leads to a reduction in the risk of mental illness and an increase in satisfaction with life's simple pleasures.. \n In conclusion, the school of thought about owning a house is more crucial than hiring one can be attributed to the country's traditions and a desire for a stable haven. From my perspective, the decrease in burdens, coupled with more time for self, makes this develop largely positive.","The first paragraph cannot meet the maximum preliminary scoring considerations because the writer has not made an effort to correctly craft his opinion based on 2 reasons for discussion.

The paragraph can only receive minimal scoring considerations. \n There is too much emphasis on owning a home in the paragraph. The reasoning should create an equal discussion consideration through the proper presentation of relevant facts for comparison in the paragraph. The essay paragraphs are too wordy.

Your essay score will be better if it is concise as opposed to long.","Your essay on why owning a home is considered more important than renting in some countries, and whether this is positive or negative, needs some revisions for improvement. Let's address those points to help enhance your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your introduction should more clearly state your opinion alongside the reasons you'll discuss. Instead of repeating the prompt, try to summarize your view in a sentence or two. This makes your stance clear from the beginning and engages the reader.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay is generally well-written, but it could benefit from more concise language. Aim for clarity and brevity, ensuring that each word serves a purpose. Avoid overly long sentences as these can sometimes make your argument harder to follow. Check that each paragraph sticks to a single main idea for clearer structure.

3. **Author's Point of View:** Your viewpoint is noticeable, which is good. However, enhancing the introduction as suggested can make it clearer right from the start. Make certain each paragraph supports your opinion concretely, aligning with your overall stance.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You've provided examples and reasons why owning a home is valued, such as tradition and stability. Still, try to balance your discussion by briefly acknowledging the opposite perspective—even if to refute it. This makes your argument more robust. Also, strive for succinctness in your reasoning; this ensures your arguments are potent and direct, which is especially important under time constraints.

Remember, while the emphasis on home ownership offers insights into cultural and societal values, mentioning the benefits or challenges of renting might provide a more balanced view and adhere to the requirement for discussion. Furthermore, shortening and simplifying your sentences will make your essay clearer and more impactful, crucial for effectively communicating your argument within a limited word count. 

Finally, diversifying your examples and ensuring each argument directly backs your point of view will greatly enhance the persuasive power of your essay. Remember, directness and clarity are key to a compelling and high-scoring essay.

However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the essay. 

Firstly, it's important to stay focused on the task's requirements. The essay prompt asks for a discussion on the advantages of each educational approach, followed by expressing a personal viewpoint. Incorporating disadvantages shifts the focus away from the prompt's requirements, which could impact the overall score. Focusing on the advantages and then clearly stating a personal stance would make the essay more aligned with the task's objectives.

Regarding grammar and punctuation, there are some errors that need attention. For instance, using punctuation marks correctly and avoiding the simultaneous use of different marks (like commas and ellipses together) will make the writing clearer and more professional. Paying attention to sentence structure and punctuation usage is crucial for improving readability and coherence.

Additionally, there are some stylistic and coherence issues. Phrases like ""not only people who study at school but also people who are taught at home are successful"" can be simplified for clarity. A straightforward writing style is often more effective, especially in exam settings. Ensuring sentences are clear and directly support your arguments can significantly enhance your essay.

It's also valuable to expand on the advantages of each method with more specific examples or evidence. Offering more detailed explanations can strengthen your position and make your arguments more convincing.

Lastly, aim for a more balanced discussion by dedicating similar attention to each perspective before concluding with your own opinion. This structure not only provides a more comprehensive analysis but also demonstrates your ability to evaluate different viewpoints before forming a reasoned conclusion.

Improving these aspects of the essay will help in delivering a more compelling and focused argument that meets the requirements of the task while displaying a strong command of language and essay structure.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Although there are certain benefits of such a trend, I would argue that this is a negative development. \n In my opinion, the rise in food imports could be seen as progress in some ways. When foods are being imported, there are a number of strict international standards to monitor the quality level of the products. This would surely ensure food safety because it encourages competition among food processing companies and only the best products end up on the market. At the same time, imports give people access to a wider range of choices and mitigate the likelihood of food shortages resulting from local production risks. For example, people in a country whose climate and land are unfavorable for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables still have fresh bananas, mangoes, tomatoes, or potatoes anytime they desire. \n Despite the positives mentioned above, I believe that the increased reliance of many countries on foreign food is negative in the long term. Firstly, the national food security will depend on the political, economic, and social stability in other countries elsewhere, and therefore are vulnerable and unsustainable. Secondly, food imports may have an adverse effect on local production since it could lead to lower prices that perhaps most local small-scale producers are not able to compete with. This means that many people would be discouraged or deprived of jobs, resulting in a decline in the domestic food industry. And finally, it also shifts demand towards foreign foodstuffs because tastes and preferences change as the locals get used to the non-traditional cuisine. \n In conclusion, while I recognize the possible positive aspects of the import of foods to a country, I consider it to be a negative trend overall.","<quotation><del>It is true that </del></quotation> \n This statement is unnecessary as it does not address a specific discussion requirement in the original prompt or discussion instruction.

However, there are several aspects of the essay that could be improved to make your argument more compelling and to enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of your writing.

1. **Clarity and Relevance to the Topic**: 
Your opening sentence doesn't clearly introduce the topic or your stance. In academic writing, it's crucial to start with a direct thesis statement that outlines your main points. Instead of a vague introduction, clearly state your position and briefly summarize the reasons supporting your viewpoint right from the beginning. This approach will make your essay more straightforward and impactful.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: 
Throughout the essay, your grammar and spelling are generally good, which is commendable. However, to improve the flow and readability, consider varying your sentence structure and using transitional phrases to link your ideas more smoothly. This will help guide the reader through your arguments in a coherent manner.

3. **Point of View Clarity**:
Your point of view becomes clear as the essay progresses, especially when you outline the negatives of food imports. Yet, to strengthen your stance, it is beneficial to integrate your position more evidently in each paragraph. Each argument should directly support your thesis, thereby reinforcing your overall viewpoint.

4. **Argumentation**: 
While you present both sides of the issue, it's critical, especially in essays requiring a clear stance, to focus on arguments that support your position. The inclusion of opposing arguments without direct rebuttals or explanations of how they are outweighed by the negatives can confuse readers about your standpoint. Consider dedicating more space to elaborating on why the negative aspects surpass the positive effects of food importation, and ensure all paragraphs align closely with your thesis.

5. **Specific Feedback**:
- The essay could benefit from a more pointed thesis statement at the end of the introduction that outlines the specific negatives you will discuss.
- Focusing on supporting your argument alone would make your essay more cohesive and aligned with the task requirements. For instance, the paragraph that highlights the benefits of food imports could be omitted or briefly countered to avoid diluting your main argument.
- Expanding your discussion with more detailed examples and possibly including statistics or findings from credible sources could add depth to your arguments, making them more persuasive.
  
In conclusion, your essay presents interesting viewpoints on an important topic. By focusing on sharpening your thesis, aligning your paragraphs more closely with your central argument, and refining your writing style, you can significantly improve the clarity and persuasiveness of your essay.

Moreover, distance learning is likely to divert students' attention from their study.

Right now, all of your paragraphs have under developed reasons and explanations. You focused on giving reasons, but not on explaining the reasons, which further weakened your discussion presentation.","The essay makes a commendable effort in addressing the topic of distance learning's influence on education and whether it harbors more drawbacks than benefits. Initiating with an attempt to rephrase the prompt creatively sets a positive tone. However, there are several areas where improvements would make the analysis stronger and more coherent.

Firstly, clarity in responding to the essay prompt is essential. The essay appears to misunderstand the task by comparing advantages to disadvantages rather than directly stating an agreement or disagreement with the notion that distance learning is inferior to traditional university education. A straightforward statement such as, ""I agree that distance learning is less beneficial compared to traditional university education for several reasons,"" would have been a better approach. This would directly answer the question and set a clear direction for the essay.

Moving on to the structure and content, the essay attempts to balance both sides of the argument but lacks depth in explaining the reasons behind the author's position. Focusing on two main reasons why distance learning is believed to be less effective, and elaborating on these with detailed examples and explanations, would strengthen the argument. Each reason should occupy its paragraph, allowing for a clearer and more organized presentation of ideas.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are minor errors that hamper the readability of the essay. For example, ""human's needs about learning has radically changed"" should be ""humans' needs for learning have radically changed,"" and ""bring more drawbacks than benefits"" should be ""brings more drawbacks than benefits."" Attention to subject-verb agreement and the correct use of plural and possessive forms is crucial for clear communication. Additionally, avoiding repetitive phrases and maintaining a formal tone throughout the essay would enhance its style.

Lastly, the point of view is somewhat clear but could be more explicit by directly addressing the prompt's question. Emphasizing the personal stance and ensuring that each argument clearly supports this view will make the essay more persuasive.

In conclusion, focusing on a more direct response to the essay prompt, structuring the essay with clearly defined arguments, elaborating on these arguments with detailed examples, and addressing grammatical and stylistic issues will significantly improve the quality and effectiveness of the essay.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

1. **Response to the Topic:**
The essay partially addresses the topic but lacks clarity in stating the position clearly from the beginning. The introduction needs to specifically state whether the focus is on the importance of innovative individuals who can work independently or the significance of teamwork and following instructions. It's important to directly respond to the prompt more accurately to avoid confusion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**
There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For example, “It is popularly believed that corporations should be focus on taking people” should be corrected to “It is popularly believed that corporations should focus on hiring people.” Consistently checking for subject-verb agreement, proper tense usage, and sentence structure can enhance the readability of the essay. Simplifying complex ideas into more direct sentences can also help. Additionally, trying to use a broader range of vocabulary appropriately can improve the overall quality of the writing.

3. **Clarity of the Author’s Point of View:**
The point of view is somewhat clear but gets lost due to the way arguments are presented. It’s mentioned that multi-talented individuals with high creativity who can follow instructions are preferred, but this idea needs to be introduced more straightforwardly and supported more cohesively throughout the essay.

4. **Argumentation and Support:**
The arguments tend to be vague and need more development. For instance, when discussing the research of Hanoyama Company, specific examples or data should be cited to strengthen the argument. Each paragraph should contain a clear main idea followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on this idea with concrete details or examples. 

5. **Cohesion and Coherence:**
The essay lacks a logical flow, making it challenging for the reader to follow. Using cohesive devices like linking words (however, for example, therefore) can improve the connection between sentences and paragraphs. Each idea should smoothly transition to the next, maintaining a clear thread of discussion throughout the essay.

6. **Lexical Resource and Appropriateness:**
There's an attempt to use a varied vocabulary, which is good. However, it's crucial to ensure that words are used accurately and fit the context of the sentences. Expanding your vocabulary and practicing its usage in correct contexts will help.

Improving in these areas can enhance the overall effectiveness of your essays. Remember, practice is key to improvement. Don't hesitate to write multiple drafts of your essay, each time focusing on one area of improvement. This strategy will help you gradually enhance every aspect of your essay writing skills.

The original topic asked whether a certain trend is a positive or negative development. However, the essay focuses instead on explaining why green energy is a beneficial solution, which deviates from directly addressing whether the trend towards using green energy is positive or negative. To align better with the prompt, the essay should explicitly state if the move towards green energy is seen as beneficial or harmful and then provide reasons supporting that perspective.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several areas that require attention. For example:
- ""coals, oil, which forces us"" should be ""coal and oil, which force us.""
- ""in terms of there incredible features"" should be ""in terms of their incredible features.""
- ""to much"" should be ""too much.""
- ""definately"" should be ""definitely.""
- ""airon generating"" likely means ""air when generating,"" which needs clarification.

Sentences throughout the essay are sometimes complex and difficult to follow, suggesting a need for simpler and clearer expression. Breaking down complex ideas into shorter sentences can aid in making the argument more understandable.

The point of view of the essay author is somewhat clear in that they support green energy but needs to be directly connected to whether its increased use is positive or negative. To strengthen the essay, the introduction should clearly state this view in response to the essay prompt, and each supporting argument should explicitly tie back to this standpoint.

Regarding the arguments presented, while they advocate for the benefits of green energy, they need to be more descriptive and directly linked to the question of whether the trend towards green energy is positive or negative. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that states how the following argument supports the author's point of view on the trend. For instance, discussing the economic and environmental benefits of green energy could be more impactful if explicitly described as positive aspects of the trend towards its adoption.

To conclude, refocusing the essay to directly address the prompt, simplifying language for clarity, correcting grammatical and spelling errors, and ensuring that arguments are clearly supportive of the declared point of view on the trend's positive or negative nature, will substantially improve the essay's effectiveness and relevance.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Social media is being used by not only by young people, but large portion of older generation are getting involved. However there are rising concerns that people's information is being misused by various individuals and organizations without their consent. This essay will first discuss the social media's benefits and then the disadvantage it brings to us, namely our information that is publicly available for others to misuse. I argue that, overall, social media brings more advantages than the disadvantages; however, we need to be educated how to protect our data. \n Social media is one of the best by product of the internet. We can communicate with our all our friends and family instantaneously all around the global. We can share information with all of them, discuss our ideas and opinions while being thousands of miles apart from each other. Social media also has had helped people in time of emergencies and in need moral support. The Information we decide to post on our social media is critical for others to understand us better. Without it social media is meaningless; same as not talking would be for face-to-face interaction. For example, in the study of 20,000 users of Facebook around different countries, from the period 2010-2018, showed that people were more content and happy with their lives than those who didn't use social media at all. \n However, using social media has caused profound concern for data misuse. When we use social media, our information is there for the public to see. Whatever we post, there is always a risk that people who don't like us, can use the information to hurt or humiliate us. Furthermore, the social media companies regularly share information with advertisers so that they can better understand our buying patterns, our beliefs, interests etc. and promote their products or services through advertisements on these social media platforms. In the report published by FBI in 2017, up to 90% of social media users' data had been shared with third parties advertising companies without their knowledge. The report also found that 80% of all homicides, the killers used social media of the victims for their acts. \n In the end, I do believe that Social media brings more benefits compared to its negatives. The key is to post information which is not too personal and is only shared to close friends and family.

However, to align more closely with the expectations of English proficiency tests, such as the IELTS, certain improvements are needed. Below are specific points covering task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy. These suggestions aim to refine your essay further and tailor it to the test's requirements.

1. **Task Achievement**: Your essay goes beyond the expected personal knowledge and opinions, venturing into research-based arguments. For the IELTS, it's critical to focus on your experiences, reasoning, and views rather than on external research or evidence. Essays should ideally stay within a 300-word limit to ensure clarity and conciseness. To better meet the test criteria, consider rephrasing the prompt to set a clear foundation for your discussion and emphasize your personal stance without resorting to researched data.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion**: You have a clear structure that navigates through the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. However, to enhance flow and organization, make sure each paragraph sticks to one main idea, supported by your personal reasoning or experiences. Transition phrases can also help in linking ideas smoothly from one section to the next, creating a more cohesive argument.

3. **Lexical Resource (Vocabulary)**: Your vocabulary is diverse and generally well-utilized, showing a good range of language. Yet, there are instances where simpler language could convey your points more effectively. Remember, precision is key, and overly complex vocabulary might obscure your intended meaning. Aim for clarity and appropriateness of word choice to precisely reflect your arguments.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: While your essay demonstrates a variety of sentence structures, careful attention to grammatical accuracy is necessary. Monitor subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the use of articles to improve readability and correctness. Practicing these elements will help in achieving a higher score in this area.

In terms of an IELTS band score, your essay shows potential but would benefit significantly from focusing less on external research and more on personal insights and experiences. Given the observed strengths and areas for improvement, a careful revision focusing on the feedback points could elevate your score towards a higher band. Remember, proficiency tests like the IELTS prioritize the ability to convey personal viewpoints and analyses clearly and coherently within a specific word count and time frame. 

Lastly, drafting your essay within the 40-minute timeframe is crucial for test readiness. Plan your essay with a quick outline, spend the majority of your time writing the draft, and allocate enough time to review your work. This strategy will help in managing your time effectively during the actual exam.

However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the essay's clarity, effectiveness, and adherence to the task's requirements.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempted to discuss both views regarding e-books and printed books for children but failed to explicitly state a personal opinion. It's crucial in such essays to not only present both sides but also to clearly articulate your viewpoint. Consider structuring your essay to include a distinct personal perspective section or integrate your opinion when discussing each view.

2. **Essay Structure**: For better clarity and coherence, adopt a more structured approach. A five-paragraph format could be beneficial: start with an introduction that restates the question and your intent to explore both views. Then, dedicate two paragraphs to discussing each perspective, followed by a paragraph expressing your personal viewpoint, and conclude with a summary of the discussion. This structure helps in organizing your thoughts and ensuring that you address all parts of the task.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several spelling errors (e.g., ""write"" instead of ""white,"" ""equipted"" should be ""equipped"") and grammatical mistakes (e.g., ""The pros is"" should be ""The pros are""). Incorrect use of plurals and singular forms can confuse readers. Additionally, use more formal language for an academic essay; avoid colloquial expressions and ensure correct punctuation. Breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones can also aid in making your argument more understandable.

4. **Clarity and Supporting Arguments**: While the essay mentions pros and cons of both e-books and printed books, these points need to be more detailed and supported by examples or evidence. For instance, when mentioning eye diseases or cognitive development, providing studies or statistics could strengthen your argument. Also, ensure that all abbreviations are explained and that the relevance of each point to the argument is clear.

5. **Use of Pronouns and Cohesion**: The essay's flow could be improved by ensuring smoother transitions between points and more cohesive use of pronouns to refer to the groups or opinions being discussed. Each paragraph should logically follow from the one before, leading the reader through your argument in a structured way.

Remember, revising an essay is a valuable opportunity to refine your arguments and enhance your expression.

4440,https://essayforum.com/writing/choosing-job-salary-important-consideration-90539/,test,"When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people believe that the amount of paycheck is the most important factor when it comes to job hunting. I completely disagree with this opinion as there are other aspects to consider when applying for a job. \n I believe that we should work in a field that suits our abilities. Some jobs guarantee a higher salary rate in comparison to other occupations that attract those who aim to make a lot of money. However, these jobs demand special skills and proper training from the employees. To illustrate, jobs in the medical field such as doctor or surgeon ensure good income, yet workers in the field are required to complete years of academic study which is not accessible to everyone. Some people could not enter Medical school while others choose to drop out due to the overwhelming study program. \n Jobs can have a profound impact on our life and I think that it is important to have an occupation that we are passionate about. An average person spends 8 hours at work per day, hence the quality of a workday undeniably affects our physical and psychological health. Working in a field of our interest is wonderful because we can do things that we like while also making ends meet. By contrast, it is detrimental to stay in a job that brings us no joy despite the high income it. The stress from work lingers on even after we leave the workplace, leaving us drained and disoriented. This long-term unhappy state of mind could eventually lead to mental issues such as depression and anxiety. All the money we made would be spent on therapies and medications to get ourselves better. \n In conclusion, applying for a job is an important decision that should be made based on our academic performance and interest.","The essay is well developed for the most part. The paragraphs connect well from the restatement + opinion, first reasoning paragraph, and second reasoning paragraph. However, the second reasoning paragraph lacks a balanced presentation when compared to the first explanation presented. Where the first reason was properly supported by a strong thesis, applicable supporting examples, and relevant explanations, the second paragraph did not completely deliver in the same manner. \n When one is trying to make a valid point, the discussion should have a razor sharp focus on a single, strong basis. The dual topic discussion created a less than well-developed like of reasoning. The first topic, while valid, is too brief in reasoning development. The second topic, connects better to the previous discussion and has a more solid explanation. It creates a comparative discussion that remains true to the writer's opinion statement. \n Finally, the concluding summary needs more work. A proper recap of the topic , opinion, and final supporting reasons would have closed the essay on the strongest possible note.","Your essay on job satisfaction versus salary in job selection presents a cogent and engaging argument. It's evident that the topic is addressed fully with a clear stance against prioritizing salary alone. The focus on passion for work and its impact on physical and mental health showcases deep thinking and understanding of the subject matter.

However, to enhance the essay further, attention to a few areas could prove beneficial:

1. **Balance and Development of Arguments**: While the essay begins strongly with a clear disagreement on prioritizing salary, it moves into supporting arguments that vary in strength and development. The example of the medical field clearly supports your thesis by showing the trade-off between high income and the demands such jobs entail. This is well-explained and detailed. On the contrary, the discussion on job satisfaction's impact on health, though compelling, could be bolstered with more concrete examples or statistics to match the robustness of the first point. Striving for a balance where each supporting argument is equally strong and well-developed will make your essay more persuasive.

2. **Clarity and Cohesion**: The essay flows well from paragraph to paragraph, but there are instances where sentences could be clearer. For example, consider reviewing sentences that feel incomplete or abruptly end, such as the one discussing the detriments of staying in an unsatisfactory job. Ensuring each sentence is complete and contributes to your argument will improve readability and impact.

3. **Spelling and Grammar**: Watch out for minor spelling and grammatical errors. While these are few, careful proofreading can help eliminate them, lending your essay a more polished appearance. For instance, revising phrases for consistency in tense and number agreement will aid in maintaining a professional tone throughout the essay.

4. **Conclusion Strengthening**: The concluding paragraph could be more impactful with a concise summary of your primary arguments followed by a reiteration of your stance. This is your opportunity to leave the reader with a lasting impression of your viewpoint. Consider highlighting how job satisfaction not only benefits one's health and happiness but also can lead to long-term career success, which in turn, might result in financial gain.

Your essay clearly communicates your point of view and provides persuasive arguments in favor of passion over paycheck in job selection.

You are not using transition sentences nor phrases. \n You also know that you will not be able to do actual research at the testing center since this is a pen and paper test and any terminals in the center will be LAN only right? You did not write this essay from a personal knowledge or point of view, which makes me wonder how familiar you truly are with the given topic. It is important that you use only public knowledge or personal information for these types of direct question essays in order to help you meet the time and presentation requirements during the practice test. \n Try to learn how to write about the reasons for obesity in a connected manner. The same applies for all your future essays, regardless of the prompt requirements. Connecting the discussion points help to increase your scoring potential overall. For example: \n <em>Junk food is one of the main reasons that children gain weight. When combined with a sedentary lifestyle, there is a tendency for the combination create an obese person. In addition to these two factors, one also has to consider the part that genetics plays in weight gain. That said, when a child is fond of junk food, does not exercise, and comes from a heavy weight family, the combined factors can definitely lead to obesity which, in turn, can lead to health problems.<br/><br/>Health problems such as adolescent hypertension, high cholesterol, and vitamin deficiencies are caused by obesity. When a child is not fond of exercising, the chances for increased health problems such as heart disease also increase. Therefore, obesity presents more than just nutritional problems in an adolescent. It also places a the young person's health at risk. Therefore obese youngsters should be advised to lower their weight due to health considerations.</em> \n The above example shows you how to create a connected discussion of different topics, well developed in each paragraph. Each one connecting to the next paragraph in order to meet the clarity, cohesiveness, and coherence requirements of the essay. Once you meet a high score in the TA and C&C scoring bracket, you will most likely get a higher score in the remaining scoring elements as well. If you compare my partial presentation to what you wrote, you will see that mere discussion points , as you presented, do not really address the questions being posed by the prompt in the required manner and format.","The essay attempts to address the serious issue of global obesity, its causes, and potential solutions. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay somewhat addresses the given topic by identifying causes and proposing solutions for obesity. However, the discussion lacks depth and personal insight. It reads more like a list of points rather than an interconnected narrative. Engaging with the topic through a more personal or public knowledge point of view, rather than relying on a detached presentation of information, would make your arguments more compelling and genuine.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay, as well as instances of awkward phrasing (""website suffering"" should be ""web surfing"", ""obesity is becoming a global disease, cause many related pathology and serious complications"" could be ""obesity is becoming a global disease, causing many related pathologies and serious complications""). Also, the essay lacks transition sentences, which are essential for connecting your ideas smoothly and guiding the reader through your arguments. This can impact the readability and flow of your essay.

3. **Point of View**: The point of view is not strongly established. Writing from a personal or well-informed perspective, using public knowledge, will help to make your essay more relatable and insightful. Showing how you connect with the topic or demonstrating a deeper understanding beyond listing facts will make your essay stand out more.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: While the essay mentions various causes and solutions for obesity, these are not explored in depth or linked together in a cohesive way. For instance, discussing how sedentary lifestyle choices combine with poor dietary habits and genetic factors contribute to obesity would provide a more detailed and connected argument. Each paragraph should build on the last, weaving a coherent narrative that guides the reader to a clearer understanding of your position.

To improve your essay:
- Incorporate transitions between sentences and paragraphs to better connect your ideas.
- Dive deeper into each point, explaining how they interrelate rather than simply listing them.
- Aim for clarity and simplicity in your language to ensure your ideas are communicated effectively.
- Pay close attention to spelling and grammar to present a polished and professional piece of writing.

By focusing on these aspects, you can develop a more persuasive and coherent essay that not only addresses the prompt more directly but also provides a clear and insightful discussion on the topic of obesity.",3,4,4,3,3,3,3,2,3,1,Informative

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argue that the multiple choice for national leaders to resolve the issue of traffic jam is allowing their inhabitants to access public transport free of charge in every time. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this view. \n It is understandable why some might hold the view that free public transport could deal with the difficulties of traffic congestion. Their rationale is that when people do not have to pay to use these types of transport, they would use it more frequently and traffic congestion would no longer appear and as a consequence, this action could reduce heavy traffic in rush hours when the number of private vehicles is rising. However, I believe that this is a shortsighted view. In fact, this could lead to a shortage of public transport and buses and trains would become overcrowded. Thus, the government would have to channel their money into upgrade these means of transport, which could be a financial constraint for them because there are many sectors such as healthcare or education need this budget. \n In addition, I am definitely convinced that traffic jam could be resolved if the authorities can ban several types of transports such as large trucks in certain time frames. Consequently, the number of vehicles on roads would be controlled effectively, which will ease the traffic flow. Another solution might be that the government should improve road systems by building roads wider and more flyovers, which could allow more vehicles to travel and help curb traffic jams. \n In conclusion, there are sufficient grounds to reject the view that providing free public transport could resolve traffic jams. It is my genuine belief that a better option is to improve the road traffic.","The prompt paraphrase needs work. It is confusing to read and does not follow the original theme of the presentation. I am not sure where you got the idea that this is an argument (it is a discussion) and that there is a multiple choice of solutions (there aren't). You did get the extent response right though so, good work on that. However, your extent response is lacking. There should have been 2 topics outlined as to why you disagree with the view. \n In the reasoning paragraphs, the solution that you presented is out of place. That is not a discussion requirement and as such, will result in a word deduction on your part. You will only be scored for the parts that you wrote which coincide with the discussion requirements as presented. So, rather than having a score based on 285 words, you will have a score based on 209 words instead. That means, your essay is now under the word count and appropriate word percentage deductions will be applied. Needless to say, the deduction will result in an immediate failing score on your part. It will be difficult to recover from that type of penalty as you even have spelling, grammar, along with C&C errors in the presentation, that will also result in points deductions. \n Further review of your work shows me that you have only 1 actual reasoning discussion based on your actual opinion. The first half, is an explanation of the public point of view which is unnecessary. There should have been a 2nd related succeeding paragraph presentation to complete the 2 reasoning paragraph requirement for the extent essay. The examiner only wants to know the 2 reasons you do not support the given statement. He doesn't need you to explain the topic to him. He is already familiar with it.","The essay does address the topic of whether free public transport is a viable solution to traffic congestion. However, it starts off somewhat unclearly, confusing what the actual task is. It's important to directly and clearly paraphrase the prompt, ensuring an accurate understanding of the discussion at hand. This clarity will help in constructing a coherent argument throughout the essay.

In terms of argumentation and structure, the essay correctly identifies the author's position on the subject, which is a strength. However, it falls short in fully developing this stance. A more effective approach would involve outlining two clear reasons for disagreeing with the view that free public transportation can solve traffic jams. This discipline in essay structure not only makes arguments easier to follow but also meets the requirements of the task more precisely.

Regarding content, introducing alternative solutions to traffic jams, while interesting, may diverge from the task's focus. It is vital to stay on topic and ensure that all content directly supports the argument at hand. In this case, elaborating on why free public transport is not a viable solution would have been more relevant than exploring alternative solutions.

It's also noteworthy that there are several spelling, grammar, and coherence and cohesion (C&C) issues in the essay. These errors can distract from the main arguments and reduce the overall clarity and impact of the essay. Focusing on revising for these errors will not only improve readability but also significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness.

Lastly, the essay would benefit from a more balanced discussion. While it's essential to express a personal opinion, it is equally critical to provide a structured argument that supports this view. Offering one reason against and not adequately building on it leaves the essay feeling incomplete. Developing two detailed reasons for the position would create a more persuasive and robust essay.

In conclusion, while the essay tackles the relevant topic and presents a clear personal stance, honing in on structure, staying focused on the task, refining grammar and spelling, and providing a more detailed supporting argument will greatly enhance its quality. These improvements are not only pivotal in addressing the topic effectively but also in ensuring adherence to English proficiency test standards.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,2,3,1,Argumentative
4443,https://essayforum.com/writing/international-travel-became-popular-77071/,test,Why international travel became so popular?,"In recent years, travelling around cultures has gradually become a prevalent and publicly recognized phenomenon. This increasing popularity of international travel is combination to several factors ,in my point of view is accompanied by considerable benefits. \n A number of reason have been put forward for rapidly increasing tourists in the past decades. First of all, people want to get refreshment due to their glowing pressure from workloads from therefore more and more people choose travel as the way of relieving their stress in work. Secondly, It is much easier for people to obtain holidays information than ever before. In the past, the limitation of wealth and cutting-edge technologies inhibited tourisms exposing tourist attractions and advanced societies which are located in far-flung areas or even another countries. However, nowadays, the advanced modern technologies make it very easy to gain knowledge about places of interest all over the world through the Internet. \n It is obvious that tourism bring great benefits to not only the host country but also travellers. Firstly, it contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide variety of services, including goods, food, souvenirs, accommodation and travel. To take the France an example. Annually, having a million tourism from overseas visit to see places like Eiffel Tower or old castles along the Lorie valley, which results in a wide range of career opportunities for local communities. Secondly, travelling is a good ways to broadens the horizons of visitors to see the world. For instance, early exposing to advanced societies helps travellers to gain new ways of thinking and behaviour which bring a certain edges on their work and life. Therefore, they are able to attain exceptionally high standards in their career way. \n In conclusion, traveling are gradually becoming an indispensable part in human life by this enormous contributions. Furthermore, It seems clearly to me that tourism have certain positive impacts on making man whole.","Dear student, this would have been a well graded essay if you had not made a mistake in the opening statement. The discussion sentence at the end should have indicated that you were going to discuss the popularity of international travel as a positive development. There was no call for a ""benefit"" discussion in the essay because that is not the point of the prompt. In your misguided attempt to try and impress the reviewer with your vocabulary skills, you ended up changing the prompt discussion manner instead, which would have resulted in a score that may or may not be passing for you in an actual test setting. \n All of your paragraph ideas are little developed because you are discussing too many little related topics in every paragraph. The rule of thumb for this essay is always to present only one opinion, supported by facts in every paragraph. The reviewer is looking for evidence of a coherent and cohesive paragraph development. That cannot be accomplished by presenting multiple topics, with very little evidence to support each one, in every paragraph. Focus on one reason, develop the supporting argument, and come out with a stronger opinion essay. \n Do not use American terms if you are not sure of how it is spelled. Even if you know what the word means, if the wrong word is used in the sentence it results in an improper topic or sentence presentation. Your LR score will be severely affected. The term is ""growing pressure"", not ""glowing pressure"". Glowing means to express great praise while growing means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically.","The essay addresses the topic of the popularity and benefits of international travel, which is a good start. However, the introduction could be improved by clearly stating that the discussion will focus on why international travel has become popular and why it is seen as positive. This clearer introduction would help align your essay more closely with the expected response to the prompt.

It is essential to focus on developing your ideas more thoroughly within each paragraph. The essay attempts to cover too many topics with insufficient detail. To enhance your essay, try to concentrate on one main idea per paragraph and expand on it with specific examples and clear reasoning. This approach will help create more cohesive and coherent paragraphs, making your argument stronger and more convincing.

Regarding spelling and grammar, there were a few errors that could impact the clarity of your essay. For example, the phrase should be ""growing pressure"" rather than ""glowing pressure."" Remember, using the correct terminology is crucial for accurately conveying your message. Similarly, phrases like ""combination to"" should be ""combined with,"" and ensure subject-verb agreement is consistent (e.g., ""bring"" should be ""brings"" when referring to how tourism contributes).

Be cautious with your word choice to ensure you're using terms correctly and in the right context. It's also beneficial to review the use of articles, such as when you mention ""the France"" instead of just ""France.""

Your essay does well to highlight the positive aspects of tourism, both for travelers and host countries. This includes the economic benefits and the opportunity for cultural exchange and personal growth. Enhancing your essay with more precise examples and a clear structure will make your argument more compelling.

In summary, focusing on clear and cohesive development of one idea per paragraph, correcting spelling and grammar issues, and ensuring the accurate use of terminology and context will significantly improve your essay. These changes will not only make your argument stronger but also help in more effectively conveying your perspective on the benefits of international travel.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative
4444,https://essayforum.com/writing/people-shopping-habits-depend-age-group-belong-89019/,test,People's shopping habits depend more on the age group they belong to than any other factors.,"It is believed that nothing exerts as much influence on one's shopping habits as the age bracket into which he falls. I disagree with the idea. In my opinion, there are a variety of factors which are more influential. \n First, disruptive innovations including online shopping overshadows age in determining people's shopping habits. The elderly, who are the most conservative segment of the population, tend to stick to old norms and practices. They are usually in contrast with younger people, who are eager to embrace novelties. However, in this era when electronic commerce is on the rise, even senior citizens are turning to shopping websites and thus they do not show much difference from young shoppers. For example, my grandfather, who will turn 85 this year, and me, who is in my early 20s, both become regular users of Taobao, the Chinese version of Amazon. \n When to make purchases, affordability is another consideration which carries more relevance than age. Most of people, regardless of the age, are habituated to buying the best things for which they can pay. Take clothes, for example. The rich tend to develop a habit of going to fancy boutiques in pursuit of customized suits that never fail to arrest attention, while the poor perhaps have no choice but habituate themselves to browsing eBay for what is sold at discount. \n In conclusion, I am in disagreement that age is the most significant factor in deciding one's shopping habits. His financial means can have more impact. Innovations which bring revolutionary change to life also exceeds age in terms of relevance.","In the restatement + response paragraph, the additional task accuracy score and clarity of your opinion consideration will come from the final sentence. You already disagreed with the statement, You already said you were going to give your opinion based on a variety of influential factors. Why didn't you outline these topics for discussion in the same paragraph to help add to the overall conciseness of your presentation. The restatement + response paragraph also serves as your thesis statement for your opinion. So the strength of your opinion, the clarity of your support, comes from the way that you clearly support your opinion with opinion discussion points and then following through in the actual discussion paragraphs. \n The discussion presentation is clear in every paragraph and well supported. However, you are scored also on the natural sounding opinion that you present. The discussion needs to flow naturally in terms of word usage. The ease by which the reader can understand your presentation is scored in the GRA section and the LR considerations. When you use words that sound like you are just trying to impress the examiner to get a higher score, you tend to score less. Mostly because the word you have chosen to use does not truly fit the sentence requirement. Words such as habituate, when the term ""used to"" fits better shows a memorized phrase type of writing. You should try to insert everyday words in your presentation rather than ""big words"" that tend to remove the ease of sentence presentation to the reader. Additionally, the term ""poor"" was misused in this presentation. The poor would not have access to the internet, much less have the extra cash to use for online shopping. However, the middle class do have a greater tendency to shop on eBay at a discount. The word reference matters, not just the meaning of the word. Every word has to be used in the proper context, based on a relevant meaning.","Your essay provides a clear stance on the topic, effectively arguing that factors other than age, such as technology and financial means, play a significant role in influencing shopping habits. This perspective is well-supported through examples and reasoning. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance clarity, accuracy, and the effectiveness of your argument.

1. **Introduction and Thesis Statement:**
   - Your introduction nicely sets up the essay topic, but it could be strengthened by directly outlining the main points you plan to discuss. This will not only improve the conciseness and coherence of your presentation but also serve as a more powerful thesis statement. For instance, after stating your disagreement, briefly mention the influential factors like technological advancements and economic status that you will explore.

2. **Language and Word Choice:**
   - Strive for simplicity and clarity in your language. Avoid using complex or less common words when more straightforward ones will suffice. For example, instead of ""habituated,"" consider saying ""used to."" Such changes will make your essay more accessible and easier to understand, thus improving its overall flow.
   - Be cautious with your word choices to ensure they accurately reflect your intended meaning. The use of ""poor"" to describe individuals shopping on eBay might not be entirely accurate, as individuals with limited financial resources may not have access to the internet for online shopping. A more appropriate term might be ""middle class"" or ""budget-conscious"" shoppers.

3. **Clarity and Support of Arguments:**
   - Each of your paragraphs introduces relevant points that contribute to your argument. However, ensure that the connections between your examples and the overarching thesis are clear and explicit. This involves not only presenting evidence but also explaining how it supports your assertion that factors other than age are more influential in determining shopping habits.

4. **Stylistic Issues:**
   - Pay attention to the structure of your essay, including transitions between paragraphs. Smooth transitions will help to maintain the reader's interest and enhance the flow of your essay.

In conclusion, your essay demonstrates a thoughtful examination of the factors influencing shopping habits beyond age. By focusing on refining your thesis statement, simplifying your language, choosing words more carefully, and clearly connecting your evidence to your arguments, you can make your essay even more persuasive and engaging. Keep up the good work, and consider these suggestions as opportunities to further refine your writing skills.",4,3,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

I completely agree with this view and will give my reasons below. \n Music has a high value which is entrenched in cultures in community around the world. Perhaps the best example would be Kpop trend. Everyone hadn't known much about Korea and its culture since Kpop became more popular. Kpop fans who live in some countries not only will find more information to understand their idols' life and culture but also network with foreign fans. They will be excited to share their feelings, their thoughts to every people, regardless of cultures and by that way, people who have the same idol will understand each other more and more. Beside the popularity of Kpop, US and UK music is other connection chance for people who live in the rest of the world. \n Just as it transcend cultures, music has the ability to link people together from different generations. We can all enjoy a strong rhythm or a beautiful song and the best songs seem to have the same magical effect on us. This would explain why grandparents can dance and sing with their grandsons or granddaughters while listening to their both favourite melody. Furthermore, there are some messages in the song to encourage in strengthening a family relationship. For instance, in the Baby shark song, it has only few repeat sentences but still naturally comes in our heart and brings families together. \n In conclusion, I believe that music is unique in its capacity to create shared experience between people, irrespective of culture and age.","Your opening paragraph is not enough of a paraphrase for the examiner to see this as a properly developed restatement of the original prompt. It is still too similar to the original presentation. It is almost a word for word translation, rather than an explanation of the given topic. The explanation you give, is what will constitute your paraphrasing of the topic. You also should have indicated, after your degree of agreement with the topic, the 2 reasons that will be supporting your opinion. These will appear as the discussion outline for the direct opinion essay. It has to be indicated because it is referred to in the prompt. \n The paraphrase section needs to have at least 3 sentences, or 5 at the most. You only wrote 2 sentences because your first sentence is a run-on. It is just an extremely long single sentence that should have been broken down into 2 more sentences. The same problem exists in your concluding paragraph. There is no clear discussion summary / paraphrase represented. It should contain the same sentence count at the prompt paraphrase (5 sentences maximum) and should repeat your opinion, reasons, and include a closing sentence. A single sentence is never considered a concluding paragraph. It is because of these problems that your TA scores will be affected negatively. \n Spelling errors: \n Kpop K-Pop \n Grammar problems: \n Failure to use a comma after a conjunction (rhythm <b>,</b> or a beautiful song...) \n Noun phrase disagreement - both their favourite melody = ... favourite melodies \n Do not use word of uncertainty in an opinion paper. It is either you are sure of your statement or not. There is no maybe or perhaps in the presentation. \n Do not use contractions in a formal essay. Always use the two word presentation system (e.g. don't = do not) \n Being your first essay, you can see that you have several errors that will greatly affect your score and prevent you from passing. It would be better if I hold off on scoring your work until your second or third essay, when you should have shown enough improvement for me to judge if you can pass the test or not.","Your essay begins with the powerful notion that music unites people across cultures and generations, which immediately aligns with the topic. However, the way you introduce the subject and its supporting points needs refinement to distinctly articulate your stance and the reasons behind it. Let's explore how we can enhance your essay:

1. **Topic Response and Paraphrasing**:
   Your opening doesn't sufficiently reinterpret the prompt. Instead of merely rephrasing the topic, delve deeper. Explain what the power of music means to you and how it unites people. Rather than stating, ""I will give my reasons below,"" outline your arguments briefly in the introduction. For instance, you could mention the role of K-Pop and intergenerational connections as your key points.

2. **Sentence Structure**:
   Your essay includes run-on sentences that make it challenging to follow your ideas. Try breaking down long sentences into shorter, clearer ones. This will improve readability and help your points come across more effectively. Similarly, your conclusion should encapsulate your opinion, summarize your arguments, and end with a strong closing statement, all within a concise structure.

3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**:
   Watch out for spelling errors (e.g., ""Kpop"" should be ""K-Pop"") and grammatical inconsistencies. For example, always include a comma after conjunctions when they precede a list or another independent clause. Correct the noun phrase disagreement to reflect pluralization accurately, as in ""their favourite melodies."" Avoid using uncertain language like ""perhaps"" in a persuasive essay—your statements should convey confidence. And remember, contractions (e.g., ""don't"") are not suitable for formal writing; use ""do not"" instead.

4. **Clarity of Argument**:
   While your essay presents compelling examples (like K-Pop and the ""Baby Shark"" song) to illustrate music's unifying power, dive deeper into these illustrations. Explain why these phenomena have such a strong impact, and if possible, include additional evidence or personal experiences to fortify your arguments.

5. **Point of View**:
   Your perspective is evident, which is excellent. However, enhancing the clarity and depth of your arguments will make your viewpoint even more persuasive and engaging to the reader.

Remember, writing is a process of continuous learning and improvement. Addressing these points can significantly elevate the quality of your essay, making your arguments more compelling and your writing clearer.

Is it right?,"Choosing a suitable leader is of paramount importance regarding the progression of a company. From my perspective, despite some outstanding qualities that young people may possess, the aged members are more qualified to hold managerial positions. \n On the one hand, young individuals can be good leaders for some reasons. Firstly, young people are likely to be physically stronger, therefore, they can handle a heavy workload and responsibilities. This might be a key selection criterion for crucial positions in an organisation, because being a leader requires people to deal with intense schedules under great pressure. Secondly, younger people tend to be more creative at work. They, as a result, can come up with extraordinary ideas or initiatives which may lead to fruitful results for the company in the future. \n On the other hand, there are some compelling reasons why elderly people can be superior candidates to younger members for high positions in an organisation. As old people have worked for many years, they have accumulated not only much more work experience but also deeper understanding about the entrepreneurial culture of the company they work for than the younger members. This, therefore, may allow them to find optimal solutions when it comes to pivotal decision point. Additionally, senior people may exert greater influence on other members in the company because people tend to pay their respects to the elderly. Compared to the young, old people can obviously have a more powerful voice, hence running the business more efficiently. \n In conclusion, better state of health and a sense of creativity may make youngsters good leaders, however, I am still convinced that these important positions should be given to old people who possess more experience and influential voice.","the essay has a specific discussion instruction.

When you prove that you cannot understand simple English instructions, as seen in this essay that you created, the examiner will know that you are not ready to study in an all English environment yet.","The essay presented is an attempt to discuss the suitability of leaders based on age for managerial positions in a company. Although the effort in presenting both sides of the argument is commendable, it is necessary to focus more squarely on the examination's requirements. The first aspect to improve is understanding and adhering strictly to the topic. The task demands a clear stance—choosing one viewpoint and defending it throughout the essay. Instead, a balanced comparison is provided, which detracts from meeting the specific instructions.

Focusing on spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written with few errors. However, it's beneficial to be vigilant for subtle mistakes that might affect clarity and coherence. Keeping sentences concise and avoiding redundancy can also enhance readability and the overall impact of the arguments.

Regarding clarity of the author's point of view, while a preference is eventually stated, the essay spends considerable time discussing both sides equally. This approach blurs the author's stance until the conclusion. For a stronger essay, it would be advisable to assert the chosen perspective early and use the main body to thoroughly defend this viewpoint with clear and articulate reasons.

The arguments provided in the essay, though insightful, do not fully align with the requirement to focus exclusively on supporting the author's stance. For improvement, select arguments that directly underpin the chosen perspective and explore these in-depth. This means if the focus is on the advantages of older leaders, the essay should concentrate on elaborating these points, rather than presenting the merits of younger leaders as well.

It's crucial, too, to consider the impact of the structure on the essay's effectiveness. Each paragraph should clearly contribute to defending the chosen viewpoint. Introductions can be more compelling by stating the chosen position upfront, and conclusions should reinforce this stance unequivocally, avoiding any ambiguity about the author's opinion.

In summary, while the discussion provides valuable insights into leadership qualities across age groups, adhering more closely to the task instructions, asserting a clear viewpoint from the outset, and focusing the arguments to support this viewpoint would significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness. Distilling arguments to support solely the chosen perspective while avoiding a balanced discussion when not required by the prompt will align the essay better with the examination's expectations.",4,4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

I strongly agree with this belief and will explain why in the succeeding paragraphs.</em> \n You need to make your presentation original, while still keeping the essence of the original prompt in the presentation. I suggest that you review the other essays here that have the same problem as yours so that you can see how they managed to improve their writing in that area.","The essay addresses the topic well, focusing on the importance of children making their own career choices rather than being influenced or forced by their parents. This clear stance is a strength. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, correctness, and persuasiveness.

Firstly, the opening statement requires modification to better paraphrase the prompt. The goal is to restate the topic in your own words while preserving the original meaning but not mirroring the exact phrasing. This will demonstrate a strong grasp of the topic and improve the structure and originality of your essay. A suggestion would be to start with a broader statement about the significance of career choice and the various influences on it before stating your position.

There are numerous spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention:

1. **Spelling and Grammar**: The essay could benefit from a thorough spelling and grammar check. Errors such as ""force"" instead of ""forced,"" ""pressure"" instead of ""pressured,"" and missing articles like ""a"" before ""specific career"" detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing. Also, maintaining the same tense throughout your essay will improve readability.

2. **Stylistic Issues**: Avoid repetitions and aim for variety in sentence structures to keep the reader engaged. For example, the phrase ""children should not be forced by their parents"" is reiterated with slight variations. Instead, introduce new arguments or examples to support your point.

3. **Clarity and Descriptiveness**: The arguments would benefit from more detailed examples and clearer explanations. While the essay mentions the general stress and relationship issues caused by parental pressure, providing specific, illustrative scenarios could make your arguments more compelling. Instead of general statements, detail a particular situation where a child's interest led them to a successful career path different from their parents', illustrating the positive outcomes of independent career choices.

4. **Point of View**: Your position is clear but could be strengthened by addressing potential counterarguments. By acknowledging why some parents might feel the need to guide their children's career choices and then refuting these points, your argument becomes more robust.

The conclusion effectively restates the main points, but could be enhanced by summarizing the major benefits of allowing children to make their own career choices, thus reinforcing your stance.

Finally, encouraging open communication between parents and children is a valuable point and should be expanded upon. Clarifying how this communication can take place and why it's beneficial could provide a more comprehensive understanding and actionable advice to readers.

Improving these aspects will not only address the concerns mentioned but will also elevate the overall quality of the essay, making it more persuasive and coherent.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Some people conjecture whether the media should constain the number of terrible news since people would avoid doing risky activities or not. I am in broaf agreement with this opinion and in this essay, there are some reasons to illustrate. \n Firstly, bad news which are published on any sorts of media are eligible to create unnecessary worry on human's minds. For example, in a run-down neighborhood, a reporter who writes about crimes affirmed that there had been a spate of attacks or thefts in their area recently and the thefts were arrested. People who access this information might be pessimistic and afraid of visiting this town. Hence, a tons of bad news on the media overwhelm people's thoughts and it is difficult to control the news they approach. Limiting how much bad news is the weapon against unnecessary worry happening. \n Moreover, bad news also have big impact on young people, especially children who easily vulnerable and do not have enough patience to tolerate. Take social networking websites as an example, teenagers tend to use mobile phones to gain information and they definitely read or watch bad news from that and share it to other people. Some bad things such as violence, attacks and crimes are taken priority to approach, which are innocuous and have bad influence on people's thoughts. In some cases, they enable children emerge negative awareness about this beautiful life and assure that surviving in this world is as uncomplicated as they used to imagine. Therefore, the best way to improve their positive thoughts about life is to restrict bad news on the media. \n In conclusion, bad news have a large effect on human's lives even though they are not totally bad, reporters, journalists as well as bloggers should limit moderately to make sure people have more positive look about lives.","Dear student, you are too focused on showing off your English vocabulary, without considering whether or not it makes sense to use it in sentences.

This is definitely not a good observation because this will result in a failing LR and GRA score for you. Added to the rest of the grammar problems of the essay and you will not get a passing score using this essay presentation. \n You are also either not familiar with some English words or you were careless and did not bother to edit the paper prior to submitting.

As of now, this is a very bad essay that will not pass in an actual test setting.","The essay aims to discuss a significant topic: the impact of negative news in the media on society and its individuals. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed for clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Response to the Topic**:
The essay responds to the given topic by expressing a viewpoint that supports limiting negative news in media. This stance is clear, but the arguments need to be more focused and directly linked to the thesis statement for a stronger impact.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:
There are notable errors and stylistic choices throughout the essay that hinder understanding. For instance, ""broaf agreement"" appears to be a typographical error; perhaps ""broad agreement"" was intended. Additionally, the essay features complex vocabulary and sentence structures that sometimes obscure the meaning instead of clarifying it. Simplifying language and ensuring accuracy in word usage can significantly enhance readability and coherence. Remember, clear and simple language often makes a stronger impact than complex vocabulary used incorrectly.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**:
The point of view is identifiable but gets lost amidst the convoluted language and less connected ideas. Sticking to simpler, more straightforward language can help in making the arguments more accessible and the standpoint clearer.

4. **Arguments and Support**:
The essay attempts to provide reasons for limiting negative news, mentioning its impact on general worry and particularly on children. However, these arguments sometimes lack concrete connections and examples. It would help to focus on one or two main points and develop these with clear examples and reasoned arguments. For instance, explaining how negative news affects mental health with supporting studies or statistics would be more persuasive.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- **Simplify Language**: Use clear and simple language to express ideas. Complex vocabulary is effective only if used correctly.
- **Focus and Cohesion**: Keep sentences and paragraphs focused on one main idea. This helps in maintaining a logical flow and making the essay more cohesive.
- **Clear Examples and Reasoning**: Strengthen arguments with specific examples, and explain how these examples support your viewpoint.
- **Proofread**: Pay close attention to spelling and grammar. Errors in these areas can distract from the content and weaken the essay’s impact.

By addressing these areas, the essay can achieve a clearer, more convincing presentation of the ideas and arguments related to the role and impact of media. Remember, effective communication is about clarity and precision, not just the complexity of language used.",3,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,Argumentative

While others suppose that producing these domestically is a better way. In this essay, I will discuss both views and, however, in my opinion, I claim that in order to bring back many benefits for a country, the two of them are necessary. \n To begin with, foreign movies and TV programmes play a significant role in a country's development. At first, these foreign productions can expand people's eyes about the world. In other countries, there are other landscapes, other traditions, and a lot of other things we can learn. Their streets, their dwellings, their food, and their human. We can change the way we perceive them and make our minds more objective. Likewise, we can study and enrich our culture depending on the constant creation and evolvement. Thus, foreign shows are indispensable. \n In parallel, producing local movies and TV programmes are also extremely important. Nowadays, there is a section of society that does not care about the unique tradition of their country and runs after foreignism. Recognizing the reality that foreign movies are much more preferable, the local government should pay more attention to their movie industry. The first benefit is these movies are educational, we can be educated on our honorable history to nurture patriotism. In addition, in order to develop the economy and tradition of the country. The second benefit is that when a country's movie industry has been evolved, the opportunity to popularize our culture will be expanded. Hence, producing domestic movies and programmes both contribute to economic stimulus and publicizing tradition. \n In the final analysis, the better way for a country's culture is not only to import foreign movies or produce these locally, both of them are necessary.","The prompt restatement was acceptable because you had a template to base it on. However, when you are asked to formulate an original opinion, you lose control of thought clarity and sentence structure. Your personal opinion is so confusing, it does not make any sense to the examines / reader. \n The discussion paragraphs are all incorrectly based on the writer's personal opinion alone, as evidenced by the constant use of the first person-group pronoun"" we in the paragraphs. The writer should first present a general discussion based on third person - group pronouns and then present a personal opinion of the public opinion. The essay does not fully follow the discussion requirements. Scores will not be fully applied because the discussion presentation is only partially applicable to the discussion format requirement.","This essay effectively addresses the topic by discussing the importance of both importing foreign movies and TV programmes and producing domestic ones for a country's cultural development. The introduction provides a clear restatement of the prompt, presenting the contrasting opinions on the subject, and stating a personal position that combines the two perspectives. However, the essay could benefit from clearer expression of this personal opinion and more precise sentence structure to enhance clarity and coherence.

There are a few spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could be improved. For example, paying attention to verb tenses and pluralization can make the writing more professional and easier to understand. The use of the word ""however"" in the introduction could be better positioned or replaced with a smoother transition that aligns with the flow of the argument.

When it comes to the author's point of view, the reliance on first-person pronouns (""we"", ""our"") is noted throughout the essay. While this personalizes the argument, it's advisable to initially frame discussions from a third-person perspective for a more formal and objective tone, before sharing personal opinions. This approach will strengthen the essay's argumentative structure and align better with academic writing standards.

The arguments presented to support the importance of both foreign and domestic productions are clear but could be made more compelling with specific examples and further elaboration on how these aspects contribute to cultural development and economic growth. Additionally, distinguishing between general public opinion and the author's personal viewpoint would enhance the effectiveness of the argument.

In summary, to improve, consider the following actions:
1. Work on expressing personal opinions more clearly and coherently.
2. Use third-person perspective for a more formal discussion before sharing personal views.
3. Address spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors to improve readability.
4. Provide more specific examples and elaborate on arguments to support your position.

In my opinion, I believe science and technology are beneficial in favor of world's advance. \n On the one hand, learning history can be extremely rewarding. First of all, history is the experience of ancestors which is conducive to making decision. To illustrate, the history of world war depicts many strategies of succeeding in the fight, this experience prevents people to make second mistake. In addition, it is undeniable that history is the base of culture which represent various nationalities.

The essay successfully identifies and addresses the given topic by contrasting the importance of learning history with the perceived greater value of science and technology in today’s world. It's vital, however, to expand on these ideas to meet the essay length requirements. A more thorough exploration of each viewpoint would not only add depth to the analysis but also ensure that your essay meets the minimum word count, avoiding potential deductions in scoring.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
To improve clarity and coherence, follow a structured format that first discusses public opinions on both sides equally and separately from your own before introducing your viewpoint.

Only after detailing both perspectives should your personal stance be introduced. This structure ensures a balanced comparison and a clearer progression of ideas.

While the essay is mostly clear, it is essential to pay close attention to spelling and grammar to maintain a professional and scholarly tone. For example, consider revising phrases like ""is conducive to making decision"" to ""is conducive to making decisions"". Additionally, maintaining consistency in tense and ensuring proper sentence structure can significantly improve the readability of your essay.

4. **Arguments and Point of View:**
Your point of view is evident, but the supporting arguments need further development and examples to be more persuasive. Each argument presented should be clearly linked to your viewpoint, ensuring readers understand how it supports your preference for science and technology. Expanding on your examples would also provide more substance to your arguments. 

5. **Comparative Analysis:**
Remember the importance of providing a balanced discussion before stating your opinion. This involves a detailed exploration of why some people might value history, juxtaposed against the reasons others might prioritize science and technology, without showing bias in the comparative analysis.

6. **Conclusion:**
The conclusion reiterates your stance well, summarizing that while history provides valuable lessons, science and technology are deemed more important for their practical benefits to the future. Enhance your conclusion by briefly mentioning the key points discussed to reinforce your position effectively.

I have watched many films in my life and there are so many great ones that I would like to share with my friends. However, I would like to talk about * La La Land * because I was impressed so much by this romantic movie. The movie was surrounded by two main characters namely Sebastian and Mia. Sebastian has a strong passion for jazz music in contrast with Mia. They met each other out of the blue while they were struggling in Los Angeles traffic. After many incidents, they fall in love with each other. However, they all have to pursue their dreams. They get into an argument, Mia said to him that He was abandoning his dream while Sebastian thinks that she just love him when he didn't have a job. The climax of this film was when Sebastian misses her plays that she put a great effort on. At last, they were all successful with their dreams, Mia has a happy family but not with Sebastian. It was such a very sad ending that everyone cant anticipate. There are many reasons why I choose this movie to share with myfndsire. First, the movie conveys a meaningful message that not all love stories have a happy ending. Also, this film grabs my attention with the outstanding performance of the actors and all the songs in this movie. I hope that my friends will enjoy this movie like me","Spoiler Alert! You were being asked to do a movie review, without telling the whole story of the movie. When you describe a movie that you like to your friends, don't delve so much into the story specifics. Talk about the acting, the background, the haunting music that sets up the scenes, never give away the full plot of the story. If you do that, then you won't be enticing your friends to see the movie. Additionally, you won't just be describing the movie, you will be telling the story. Hence the spoiler alert comment at the start. \n With regards to your grammar and punctuation, I found several problem points. You are not careful about how you write the words you use. What is ""myfndsire""? I believe you meant to say, ""my friends""? Review your subject verb agreement rules when it comes to writing sentences. ""Sebastian thinks that she just love him "" is wrong. ""Sebastian thinks she just loveS him"" is correct. Also ""cannot"" is a word that is written as ""can't"" in short form. However, it would be best for you to avoid using contractions in writing (cannot, did not) so that you can get used to writing in a formal manner at all times. \n You wrote well enough in this essay when you consider that you were able to express yourself in a manner that could easily be understood by others. Add to that, the way that you were able to retell the story clearly, even though the language used was not perfect or accurate at certain times. Keep writing. You can only get better from here.","The essay reflects a genuine enthusiasm for the film *La La Land*, effectively sharing this passion and potentially influencing others to view the film. This enthusiasm is a solid foundation for any review. However, there are several areas for improvement that can make the essay more impactful and engaging.

Firstly, it's essential to focus less on recounting the film's plot in detail and more on aspects like acting, cinematography, music, and its emotional impact. Remember, the goal is to entice others to watch the movie without revealing critical plot points that could lessen their viewing experience. Mentioning how the actors' performances or the music contributed to the movie's atmosphere could be more engaging and informative for the reader.

Concerning grammar and punctuation, there are errors that need attention to enhance the clarity and professionalism of your writing. For instance, it's crucial to mind the subject-verb agreement; ""Sebastian thinks that she just loves him"" is the correct form. Also, the confusion in ""myfndsire"" indicates a typo that distracts from your message. Regular proofreading can help catch and correct these mistakes before submission. 

Another point to consider is the use of contractions. While conversational language can make an essay relatable, in formal writing, it's best to use the full forms such as ""cannot"" rather than ""can't"" and ""did not"" instead of ""didn't"". This practice can elevate the tone of your writing.

Additionally, the essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Introducing the movie with a brief overview, followed by sections on different aspects you enjoyed (e.g., acting, music), and concluding with your personal reflection on the movie's message or impact, could make your review more organized and engaging.

Finally, while your essay does convey a clear opinion on the film and supports it with examples from the plot, remember to maintain a balance between sharing enough to intrigue and not so much that it spoils the experience for new viewers. Your passion for the movie is evident and engaging, and with these adjustments, your essay will not only share your enthusiasm but also inspire others to explore *La La Land* for themselves.

As a result, they are deeming whether they should admit the occurrence of advertisements in their building or not. From my perspective, advertising inside school has pros and cons but it could be an appropriate opinion. \n Initially, educational institutions are not only raise their money, but their pupils can also find out lots of useful information thanks to advertisements. There are many goods and services meeting the demand of students that suppliers can advertise at school from foods and beverages to necessary courses. For instance, after seeing a flyer of a grocery on school bulletin board, students might decide what they should pay for meals or snacks after schooldays easily. \n In addition, allowing organizations implement advertising plans inside might help schools spread their images to the general public. The management board of each educational institution should make a negotiation that in case of advertising inside their buildings, those organizations have to promote school's good points. As an example, a school in where there are lots of excellent students introduced by a foreign language center can attract more students next semester. \n On the other hand, there are some disadvantages from advertising inside school if the school leaders cannot control total content written in advertising panels. If information about a poor quality course is circulated in educational environment, it can lead to serious problems such as losing the credit of learners and their parents or lowering school's reputation. \n In conclusion, the benefits of accepting advertisements inside school can outweigh the drawbacks. In order to reduce financial burden, educational institutions can admit advertisements inside but they must take control over the advertising content strictly. \n (296 words)","You are not really offering an opinion in the response or throughout the essay.

The main problem with this essay is that you have decided to take a middle aisle position in the discussion. This is not a C/C or A/D essay so the examiner will have to score you down for not having a proper opinion for discussion in the essay. \n When you are unsure about how to respond to an essay, never take the middle seat.

What sort of ads should be allowed? \n - Should the school only focus on raising funds through advertising for their academic programs? Yes or no? Why? \n If you do not learn to analyze the question and create your own outline and outline questions that will help you better formulate a response, you will never be able to defend a solid single opinion in the essay.","**Final Feedback:**

The essay addresses the topic of allowing advertisements in schools to alleviate financial constraints, which is relevant to the assigned question. However, the response would benefit significantly from a more direct stance regarding the effectiveness of this solution. Directly articulating whether you believe this is a good or bad idea within your introduction will help clarify your position from the start. It's essential to remember that essays should aim to answer the question directly, especially when the prompt presents a specific inquiry.

One area for improvement is the clarity and decisiveness of your opinion. The essay currently takes a neutral or middle position, discussing both pros and cons without clearly siding with one. For a stronger essay, choose a side—either supporting the idea as beneficial or opposing it due to potential negatives. This will not only make your argument more compelling but also align more closely with the expectations of an opinion essay.

Regarding spelling and grammar, your essay is generally well-written, but there are instances where phrases could be more concise or clear. For instance, the phrase ""In contemporary"" at the beginning is incomplete. A more accurate start would be ""In contemporary society"" or ""Currently"". Additionally, pay attention to minor grammatical mistakes and work on sentence structure for a smoother flow of ideas.

The essay successfully outlines several pros and cons related to advertising in schools. However, to strengthen your argument, it's crucial to delve deeper into these points. For example, when discussing the benefits of information delivered through advertisements, consider specifying what kinds of ads could be educational and how they align with the school's values or curriculum. Likewise, in exploring the drawbacks, offer more detail about how exactly poor-quality advertisements could damage the school's reputation.

Lastly, reflecting on the potential impact of advertising on students and the types of advertisements that should be allowed would enrich your argument. Addressing these unspoken questions can provide a more nuanced perspective on the topic and help solidify your position, whether for or against the idea.

Conclusively, focus on stating a clear opinion, improving grammar and clarity, and deepening your exploration of the topic by considering both explicit and implicit questions related to the issue.

Thus, they should be given funding from government to maintain their work. From my perspective I completely agree with this point of view for the following reasons. \n Nowadays many gifted artists are facing financial strain and wondering whether they should follow their enthusiasm in art or doing something else to make out money. Funding for artists is a best solution for them to clear their way and work on art continuously. Doing this means artists no longer have to work on two more extra jobs to cover their personal expense. Working regardless of money must give them a fresh mind that could produce fascinating and creative concepts that could be priceless. \n Another good point to support artists is that it will benefit society in long run. Talented artists would create a work of historical or cultural art which are used as an educational resource that help people to approach them effectively.

Firstly, attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and word choice is crucial. For example, the phrase ""it often said"" should be corrected to ""it is often said"" to complete the sentence properly. Similarly, ""almost artists"" seems to be a confusion of word usage; perhaps ""most artists"" or ""many artists"" was intended here. Precise language will improve your essay's clarity and impact.

Regarding word choice, it's important to use words correctly according to their definitions. Words like ""make out money"" and ""clear their way"" seem to be incorrect or awkward phrasing. Instead, ""make money"" and ""pay their way"" are more suitable expressions in this context. Such attention to lexical resource shows a strong understanding of English and enhances your essay.

Moreover, your conclusion could be improved for better clarity and impact. For instance, revising ""... budget away but it definitely is worthy"" to ""... budget away, it is definitely worth it"" makes your sentence clearer and more grammatically correct. It helps in smoothly concluding your argument by connecting thoughts without confusion.

Lastly, the overall effectiveness of your essay would benefit from deeper exploration and clearer articulation of how government funding directly benefits both artists and society. While you touch upon these benefits, providing specific examples or elaborating on the positive outcomes could make your arguments more persuasive and your essay more compelling.

By refining your word choice, correcting grammatical mistakes, and strengthening your argumentation, your essay will be more precise, impactful, and engaging to the reader.

Firstly, Most people are more depend on the roads than railway in their daily life, especially due to the fact that more and more people are choosing drive to work in recent decades, as a result of an increasing number of the private cars, traffic jams are frequently happened in rush hour due to the poor road condition or outdated road design, so it is quite urgent to improve the roads to mitigate the load traffic pressure in city which closely related to majority people's benefit in the city. Secondly, constructing a road is faster and easier, unlike a railway, road only requires basic equipment to be built, and the same budget can usually build more roads in terms of length in shorter time, hence obviously building road is more efficient. \n But I guess there can be times when investigating on railways become more favourable, for example, railways appear to be more suitable to connect a long distance cities which could be hard to drive, in addition, railways carry more people than roads do. However, not everyone takes railway every day, but almost every one of us needs to walk or drive on the roads every day. Road has nearly become an indispensable part of the modern life \n Taking all of the above considerations into account, I am convinced that roads are more important than railways and roads are deserve more investigations.","Dear student, the main problem that you have work this essay is that you are not discussing it properly. Read the instructions again and analyze what it is asking you to do. The instruction is asking you to pick one side of the discussion and then defended it. So you should choose if you want to agree with the statement or not and then support and defend that point of view. Pick just one side to represent. This is a supporting opinion essay, not a comparison essay. So what do you have to do to fix this essay? \n 1. Properly paraphrase the opening statement, closing it with the opinion you support. \n 2. Don't discuss more than one opinion per paragraph so that you can develop a convincing argument. Present your strongest reason and develop it. You can present the second supporting opinion in a separate paragraph. \n 3. Develop a more appropriate closing statement that properly sums up your topic statement, reasons for supporting a point of view, and a restatement of your final opinion. \n These are the required changes that will better assist you in developing an essay that it's more prompt adherent and will allow you to showcase all of your English writing skills.","Your essay presents a viewpoint on whether more investment should be directed towards roads or railways, expressing a preference for roads. However, there are several opportunities for improvement to better align your essay with the task requirements and enhance clarity and impact. Here’s a structured breakdown:

1. **Response to the Topic:**
    - The task requires selecting a stance and defending it throughout the essay. You've indicated a preference for roads but also discussed railways in a manner that slightly dilutes your main argument. To improve, focus solely on supporting why roads deserve more investment. Begin your essay by clearly stating your opinion in response to the topic. This ensures the reader knows exactly what position you are advocating from the start.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
    - There are several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow and clarity of your essay. For example, ""investigate more money"" should be ""invest more money,"" and ""Most people are more depend on the roads"" should be ""Most people depend more on the roads."" Pay attention to verb tense consistency and proper sentence structure to improve readability. Additionally, consider breaking long sentences into shorter ones to make your points clearer and the essay easier to follow.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
    - Your point of view is somewhat clear, as you express a preference for investing in roads. However, this could be strengthened by directly addressing the essay question in your introduction and consistently supporting this viewpoint throughout without diverting into the advantages of railways.

4. **Arguments to Support the Essay Author's Position:**
    - Your essay includes reasons for preferring road investment, like the daily reliance on roads and the ease of road construction. However, these arguments need to be more fully developed. Each point should be explored in its own paragraph with examples and further explanation to strengthen your position. Avoid introducing new points without sufficient explanation, as this can weaken your argument.

**Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**
- **Introduction:** Start by accurately paraphrasing the question and clearly stating your opinion. This sets a solid foundation for your essay.
- **Body Paragraphs:** Dedicate each paragraph to a single reason supporting your viewpoint. Elaborate on your points by providing examples, facts, or further explanations. Avoid discussing the benefits of railways to maintain focus on your thesis.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize your arguments and reiterate your opinion more emphatically to leave a lasting impression on your reader.

Adhering to these suggestions will help in delivering a more persuasive, coherent, and focussed essay. Reflecting on and revising your work with these points in mind can significantly improve your writing skills and your ability to make a compelling argument.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

Environmental pollution can be identified as three main types such as air pollution Land pollution and water pollution. Many people think that air pollution is the most harmful pollution type in the environment since harmful atmosphere make it difficult for plants,animals and humans to survive as the air becomes dirty. Even though some people believe that by reducing air travel can be protected environment,it can't believe since there are many reasons for environmental contamination. \n one way to do this would be limit air travel because these days many people use air travel as a transportation method as a result of reducing price of air ticket rather than past. Furthermore there is no argument that air travel is the fastest method for transportation. As a result of increasing air travel it is caused to burn more fossil fuels by releasing large amount of sulfur oxides to atmosphere. Therefore,by limiting air travel it can be protect environment by reducing release of sulfur oxides . \n However,There are many other ways we could reduce emissions, for example if we can increase use of Biomass fuels instead of use fossil fuels it cause to minimize production of sulfur oxides. Furthermore,when we consider about other facts which cause to air pollute it seems that air travel is not the main reason for air pollution. Agriculture activities,exhaust from factories and industries ,Mining operations and house hold cleaning products emit toxic chemicles in the air pollution. Hence,by increasing efficiency of fuel,way pollute atmosphere.use wind,building carbon capture plants and replace coal based electric by using Nuclear can be reduced air impurity. \n In summary I believe that reducing air travel is not most effective way of reducing emissions because it is not only way pollute atmosphere.","Dear student, it would be best for your essay if you can provide us with the complete prompt instructions. At the moment, I cannot decipher the point of your essay and how it should be scored based on the band requirements because the conversation you are presenting is highly confusing and as such, does not make sense to the reader. This sort of stress upon the reader is what will earn you a low to failing score in an actual test. I believe that once you provide the complete prompt, I will be able to better direct your essay towards a proper set up. \n At the moment, your essay suffers severely in the areas of task accuracy and grammar range / accuracy. There is a lack of cohesive and coherent discussion because of the lack of focus in sentence topics. Finally, your lexical resources are questionable as they do not match the type of debate that you are trying to present. I can show you how to improve the discussion, but first, I need to know how the instructions are requiring you to respond to the prompt. Please post the original instructions in this thread as soon as you can so that I can offer you a more insightful review of your work.","The essay you have written addresses an important global issue—environmental protection and the factors contributing to air pollution. First, it's essential to ensure that the essay directly responds to the specific topic or question posed. Without the complete prompt, it's challenging to tailor the essay effectively to meet the requirements fully. Ensuring that your essay directly aligns with the prompt will help improve its relevance and focus.

One of the first things to note is that the essay needs more clarity in structure and content to enhance understanding. Each paragraph should introduce and develop a single main idea. This will help make your arguments stronger and your essay more coherent. It appears you are trying to discuss the impact of air travel on pollution and propose alternatives. Make sure each paragraph clearly supports this by focusing on one argument at a time.

Grammar and spelling are areas that also require attention. Incorrect grammar and spelling mistakes can distract readers and make the essay harder to follow. It would be beneficial to review basic grammar rules and pay careful attention to verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and the correct use of articles (""the,"" ""a,"" ""an""). Additionally, make an effort to vary your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.

The essay communicates the idea that there are multiple sources of air pollution and that focusing solely on reducing air travel might not be the most effective solution. However, this point could be made clearer and stronger with specific examples and more detailed explanations. For instance, when discussing alternatives to air travel, provide data or studies that support why these alternatives could significantly reduce pollution.

Expanding your vocabulary (lexical resource) will also help you express your ideas more precisely and persuasively. Avoid repetition of words and phrases by finding synonyms and related terms. This will not only make your essay more enjoyable to read but also demonstrate your language proficiency.

Finally, the conclusion of the essay should succinctly summarize the main arguments presented and restate your position in a compelling way. It's an opportunity to leave a lasting impression on your reader, so make sure it clearly reflects the essence of your argument.

By focusing on these areas—ensuring alignment with the prompt, improving structure and grammar, clarifying your arguments, expanding your vocabulary, and crafting a strong conclusion—you can significantly enhance the quality of your essay.

In fact, this development would introduce both positive and negative aspects, due to all of its benefits and drawbacks which have been brought to our society. \n On the one hand, the most noticeable advantage when it comes to the strengths is that people no longer have to learn foreign language anymore. Indeed, there is no doubt that were global residents to speak and share their information through only one method, there would be no need to add some other popularly-used ones like English, French or Chinese into the educational curriculum of school and university. Moreover, citizens coming from myriads of nations would be able to communicate even better and at a deeper level without any dependance on translating instrumentals or ""language barrier"" on a daily basis, which, to some extents, raise the comprehensive development of a diversity of industries such as tourism or co-operation, for instance. \n On the other hand, in terms of the opposite side, the risk of losing the variety of cultures should not also be overlooked, especially in an age that its role has already been raised by a multitude of countries. Needless to say, a majority of nations out there always consider their language as the soul of the whole people, making it an unchangeable position in their national and historical values. Undoubtedly, those countries are all proud of their traditional legacy and the born of an ""one for all"" language, paradoxically, would also mean that those conventional ones are likely to be eliminated. \n In conclusion, the trend shows effects on both sides which are all need to be taken into consideration. There are plus points regarding the convenience in communicating as well as the elimination of language barrier, but conversely, also some minus ones related to the corruption of traditional and national languages in the diversity of cultures.","<quotation>this development would introduce both positive and negative aspects</quotation> \n So which aspect do you support in this discussion?

The approach taken to discuss both the positive and negative outcomes of this scenario provides a broad perspective, but it's important to remember to closely align with the specific instructions of the essay topic. 

Firstly, the essay is well-structured, with clear divisions between the advantages and disadvantages of a universal language. However, it's critical to pay close attention to the essay prompt. If the prompt specifically asks for your stance on an issue, make sure to clearly articulate your position and support it throughout the essay, rather than presenting a balanced view of both sides. Focusing on the prompt's requirements is key to ensuring your essay meets the expected criteria.

There are some spelling, grammar, and style issues noted in the essay. For example, ""connective"" should be ""connected,"" ""dependance"" should be ""dependence,"" and ""myriads of nations"" would be clearer as ""numerous nations"" or ""many countries."" These errors can distract readers from your main points. It's also helpful to simplify sentences to make them more accessible and direct, aiding in clearer communication of your ideas.

The point of view in the essay is somewhat unclear due to the balanced discussion of benefits and drawbacks, without explicitly stating a personal perspective. To improve clarity, decide on a clear stance regarding the topic and ensure that your arguments consistently support this viewpoint. 

The arguments presented are descriptive and provide examples, such as the impact on educational curriculums and national identity. However, further elaboration and more concrete examples could enhance the persuasive power of the essay. When discussing the potential loss of cultural diversity, citing specific examples of how language contributes to cultural identity could offer more depth to the argument.

In summary, the essay provides an insightful exploration of a world with a universal language. To enhance this essay, ensure to adhere strictly to the prompt's instructions, simplify and correct language use for clarity, clearly establish your viewpoint, and provide more detailed examples to support your arguments.

4457,https://essayforum.com/writing/punishment-children-impact-development-75317/,test,IELTS Writing Task 2 - Punishment for Children and impact on their development. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? \n What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?,"Everything has a good side and a bad side, punishment is no exception. Although there is a bad side for punishment, I still believe that it is important for having punishment to teach children about the correct values. I support this with the following reasons. \n At first, punishment is an effective way to teach children for knowing what is wrong. Undoubtedly, praise can encourage children to do the right thing. In contrast, punishment can deepen children's memory for the wrong thing that they have done. Punishment has been used for over a thousand of years and it is one of the best way for teaching children according to past experience in human history. And now, punishment is still being using to punish the citizens who violate the law. \n Secondly, punishment can provide the indication of the seriousness of fault that children made. Different level of punishment apply to different level of fault which allow children to know that which fault they should never do. For example, children can be punished by standing alone for five minutes if they quarrel with each other. However, if they fight with each other, the level of punishment should become higher. In this case, the punishment can be a standing for twenty minutes. Therefore, the children can know that the fault of fighting is a worse than quarrel. \n Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that some kinds of punishment will cause a bad effect to children's psychological and physical health. In the past, parents may use physical punishment to teach their children. However, many experts already point out that it might damage the relationship between the parents and children and it also hurts the children physically. \n Therefore, it is essential for us to decide which punishment should be adopted. Personally, I believe that physical punishment should never be used for teaching children as it hurts children in both psychological and physical aspect. We could use other punishments which is not harmful to children such as packing up trash and cleaning houses etc. \n From what has been discussed above, we can finally draw the conclusion that punishment is needed for teaching children. However, we should carefully choose what kind of punishment we should use. Punishment that will cause any harm to children like hitting children should never be allowed.","Dear student, you really did an impressive job on this essay.

Although it did not affect the flow of thought and presentation of your facts, the fluency in English still has to be considered. The more fluent and sentence / grammar error free your essay gets in the future, the higher your score will get. I am convinced that you have the ability to gain a sense of fluency in your writing in the very near future. You almost have it, so don't stop practicing and reading English based material. That is the best way to gain fluency in the written language.","This essay effectively addresses the topic, arguing the importance of using punishment to teach children about correct values while cautioning against physical punishment. The argument is coherent and progresses logically from the general effectiveness of punishment to specific types of punishment and their impacts.

However, there are several areas for improvement. Firstly, attention to grammar and sentence structure is necessary. The essay contains grammatical errors and awkward phrases which can distract from the message. For example, in the sentence ""punishment is an effective way to teach children for knowing what is wrong,"" the phrase ""for knowing"" could be more fluently expressed as ""to teach children right from wrong."" Practice with sentence construction and grammar will enhance the clarity and readability of your writing.

Additionally, the essay sometimes uses phrases that are too complex or incorrect, which can confuse readers. Simplifying language and ensuring that sentences are constructed correctly will help in making the essay more understandable.

To support your arguments, providing more detailed examples or evidence could strengthen your position. While the examples given (such as different punishments for quarreling and fighting) illustrate your point, expanding on why these examples are effective or how they specifically teach children the seriousness of their actions could make your argument more convincing.

In terms of style, the essay would benefit from varied sentence structures to make the writing more engaging. This includes using a mix of short and long sentences and incorporating transitional phrases to smooth the flow between ideas.

It's commendable that the essay takes a clear stance on the issue of physical punishment, arguing against its use due to potential harm. This point of view is appropriately supported by the argument that there are alternative, non-harmful ways to discipline children, which aligns well with the essay's main thesis.

In conclusion, focusing on refining grammar and sentence structure, simplifying language, providing more detailed support for your arguments, and varying sentence style will greatly improve the effectiveness of your writing. These improvements will not only make your arguments more persuasive but also enhance your fluency in writing, contributing to a higher score. Keep practicing and engaging with English materials, as consistent reading and writing are key to developing language skills.

It is agreed that increasing use of vehicles is contributing to air pollution and certain the lack of resources. While some negative consequences are unavoidable, government and individuals can take steps to address the problems. \n There are many problems connected with an increasing in the usage of private cars. One problem is that it has a bad impact on our environment such as air pollution. Exhaust fumes from vehicles have been produced by cars every day, so Greenhouse Effect becomes aggravate. Consequently, the temperature of the earth is much hotter and the sea level is increasing. Not only do people must suffer from disasters such as earthquake, flood, tidal wave but also the life's quality is diminishing, which people must be responsible for. Running out of fossil fuels like petrol and diesel is another issue. The overconsumption of natural resources has a bad effect on the civilians. The cost of natural resources will be much higher if the overconsumption of natural resources is going to raise the few decades. Because governments are not able to produce fossil fuels. They have to import them from other countries and raise the price of civilian's duty. \n Solving an increasing in the usage of private cars problem is really important. Firstly, governments have to improve public transportation's standard as soon as possible. Using public transportations are one of the solutions to reduce an increasing in the usage of private cars. In fact, so many people think that public transportations which are not fast as private cars and really dirty. Therefore, governments ensure that civilians benefit from using it. Secondly, carpooling is another option. People who work in the same office can share car journeys. \n In conclusion, improving public transportations and carpooling is the best solution to an increasing number of the usage of private cars. If we work together, we can overcome this serious threat.","To, in the opening statement, you should not present a reason in the discussion. You should only offer an overview or give an outline of the topics you will be discussing as per the prompt requirement. So the inclusion of air pollution and lack of resources should not be included in the first paragraph. Instead, just say that you will be discussing the problems associated with the increase of car usage in the succeeding paragraphs. \n In the second paragraph, you accidentally associated car use with global warming. While there is a connection, it is very difficult to prove that global warming, as you discussed it is a direct result of increased car usage. Since you provided 2 problems caused by car use, focus on the more believable and easily justifiable discussion instead, air pollution. In these types of essays, presenting one solid and concentrated discussion of a reason is more effective than offering 2 topics for discussion. One of the two will become under developed and useless in the essay. In this case, the cause that become ill effective in the discussion was air pollution, which is the more commonly associated result of increased car usage. \n The reference to car pooling and improving public transportation should be discussed as a fully paragraph. This is a new topic for discussion and must therefore, be thoroughly developed and strengthened in reasoning and presentation prior to the conclusion. The conclusion should only close the essay by repeating the information in the opening statement, along with the discussed topics and your own opinion if required, as a recap of the previous discussion.","The essay addresses the issue of rising private car usage and its negative effects, both of which are highly relevant to the assigned topic. The position is that increasing vehicle use leads to environmental and resource-related problems, and that government and individual actions can mitigate these issues. This stance is clear and directly responds to the topic. However, the essay could benefit from following a more structured approach to enhance clarity and coherence.

Firstly, the introduction should aim to provide a broad overview of the topics to be discussed without delving into specific arguments or examples. It's advisable to outline that the essay will explore the problems associated with increased car usage and later introduce potential solutions rather than immediately discussing air pollution and resource depletion.

In terms of content development, focusing on a single, well-supported argument can be more effective than presenting multiple, less developed points. For instance, air pollution, directly linked to car usage, presents a strong, easily justifiable issue and should be the primary focus. The connection between car usage and global warming, while present, is a complex topic that requires substantial evidence and might detract from the essay's clarity. Concentrating on air pollution, backed by specific examples or data, would enhance the argument's strength and relevance.

Stylistically, the essay shows a need for clearer sentence structure and more precise language use. Phrases like ""an increasing number of the usage of private cars has been controversy"" are awkward and could be simplified to ""the increasing usage of private cars is controversial."" Attention to grammar, syntax, and word choice will significantly improve readability. Additionally, using 'vehicle emissions' instead of 'exhaust fumes from vehicles have been produced by cars every day' can make the argument more straightforward and impactful.

Moreover, the solutions proposed—improving public transportation and encouraging carpooling—warrant a more detailed discussion. Each solution could be expanded into its own paragraph, explaining how it can effectively address the issues raised. This would provide a clearer structure and enable a more thorough exploration of potential benefits and practical considerations.

Lastly, the conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points discussed, reiterating the problems posed by increased car usage and the proposed solutions without introducing new information. Restating the essay's main arguments helps reinforce the message and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the essay's position.

By tackling these areas—structuring the introduction, focusing on well-supported arguments, refining the language and syntax, elaborating on proposed solutions, and crafting a concise conclusion—the essay will present a more cohesive, persuasive, and effective response to the topic.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4459,https://essayforum.com/writing/online-education-becoming-popular-discuss-93731/,test,Online education is becoming more and more popular. Discuss about their advantages and disadvantages,"In recent years, online education is becoming a new phenomenon with increasing participation rate. It cannot be denied that this trend brings lots of specific benefits for both students and schools but also has negative influences on them. \n There are several reasons to say that distance learning is a trend worth becoming popular. Firstly, applying an online course helps students to minimize time and space spent for learning when compared to traditional education. For example, students can save time commuting from home to school and vice versa, to learn more courses and study anywhere with just an internet connection and a seat. Secondly, the cost of online education is always cheaper as the result of cutting infrastructure investment costs, leading to attracting more students to participate and increasing sales for schools. \n In contrast, there are some problems that online learning is not effective enough than traditional learning. First, it reduces the focus on the lesson, which makes the learning results not as expected. In fact, we can even surf Facebook or play chess while taking an online lesson because the teachers only controls through the computer screen without knowing if their students are really absorbing knowledge or not; which reduces the effectiveness of studying and directly affecting student's score. Second, distance learning has a serious impact on communication and social relationships of both students and teachers. People need to socialize by meeting face-to-face while online learning only allows teachers and students to meet each other indirectly through the internet, it will gradually lead to social anxiety disorder and inhibit personal development. \n In conclusion, it is hard to compare whether online education brings more advantages or more disadvantages because they always have its two sides. A balance between online education and traditional is necessary because students need to be fully developed instead of focusing on just one aspect.","Since online education is already an existing phenomenon, it is incorrect for the student to structure the introductory sentence as \n <quotation>is becoming a new phenomenon</quotation> \n . As it is currently occurring, The phrase should have been presented in current form: <em>... has become a new phenomenon.</em> That said, the restatement is still acceptable enough as it kept the original reference to the topic. The restatement of the writing slant is also very much acceptable for this presentation as it presents a writer's opinion, without being a direct writer's opinion, which is a unique way of indicating the thoughts of the writer. It will definitely be considered during the overall paragraph scoring. \n Now, both advantage and disadvantage paragraphs are well presented and discussed. However, proper example presentations would have added to the scoring considerations. Both would have done well to present an example based on the writer's personal experience and the use of first person singular pronouns. The discussion does ask for examples based on the writer's personal experience and knowledge, so group pronouns should be limited or avoided in this presentation. \n For additional improvement, the writer should also consider better connecting sentences for the presentations. Transition using subject focus rather than simple transition words or phrases for an increased C+C score. Without it, the paragraphs lack cohesiveness. How the 2 topics connect with a commonality in the presentation is lacking and will be looked for by the examiner. \n As far as the conclusion is concerned, it was okay up until the part where the writer indicated a ""balanced solution"" since the original prompt did not ask him to present a solution or suggest / recommend an action. That will score down the conclusion as it prevented a proper 2 sentence reverse paraphrase presentation from being achieved.","Your essay provides a balanced view on the topic of online education, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. However, there are areas that can be improved to make your argument more compelling and your writing clearer. Here are specific points to consider:

1. The introduction refers to online education as ""becoming a new phenomenon,"" which might not accurately reflect its current widespread adoption. It would be more precise to say that online education ""has become a new phenomenon,"" as this acknowledges its established presence.

2. The essay successfully presents both sides of the argument concerning online education. To strengthen your points, consider adding personal examples. Sharing your own experiences or observations could make your arguments more relatable and engaging. Remember, using ""I"" to share personal experiences can be effective, but be mindful not to overuse it if the context doesn't require it.

3. The transition between ideas and paragraphs could be smoother. Instead of relying on simple transitions, try connecting your ideas by focusing on how one thought leads to the next. This approach will help your essay flow better and make it easier for the reader to follow your argument.

4. The conclusion of your essay suggests a balanced approach between online and traditional education. While this shows a thoughtful consideration of the topic, it introduces a new idea of finding a balance that wasn't directly requested by the prompt. Try to keep your conclusion focused on summarizing the points made without adding new suggestions or solutions unless specifically asked for in the prompt.

5. Pay attention to sentence structure and grammar throughout your essay. Avoiding small errors will make your writing more polished and professional. For instance, watch out for run-on sentences or misplaced modifiers that could confuse readers.

By addressing these points, you can enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of your essay. Continue to reflect on both sides of an argument, use personal examples where appropriate, and ensure your writing is cohesive and closely aligned with the essay prompt.

When people live in a rent house, it is apparent that many strangers reside together and likely to cope with the risk of criminal, especially in apartment. Hence in some places are lack of security, people may endeavor to get private information with regard to the person they require by hiring detective or observing secretly.

By contrast, frequently, some tenements or blocks of flats for renting have extremely noise pollution and detrimental for families have children as well \n In conclusion, base on the convenience, people are more likely to buy houses in some nations as they don't want to be deprived of privacy and be more productive. While rented house often remain draw back such as its noise","There are two sentences that became unclear with the presence of two unnecessary word s in the prompt restatement. If you removed the phrase ""for people"" in reference to the role of owning a home, the sentence would have been clearer to the reader. Additionally, rather than ""ownership"", which was referred to in the original prompt, you should have used an alternate keyword such as ""proprietorship"". ""Rent should have also been replaced with the word lease"". It means the same thing as ownership, but was a replacement word for the original. Replacing heh keywords from the original prompt tend to increase your LR score. As for the second sentence error, it is more of a word phrase error. ""feasibly prone"". Feasible means ""capable of being done"" while ""prone"" indicates ""a natural tendency"". So the word phrase results in confusion for an ENL. Rather than trying to impress the reviewer with the use of incorrect vocabulary in reference to a positive position, you should have simply indicated that home ownership can be considered a positive outcome for people. Word usage, correct word usage, based on word meaning is very important in the overall scoring consideration. The LR score in this essay would have been greatly pulled down by the first paragraph vocabulary errors alone. \n There is no such thing as a ""rent house"". Again, this is incorrect vocabulary usage. There are rented houses, rented homes, rentals, but never rent houses. To rent a house means the act of contracting a house to live in, it does not mean that you live in it. You also cannot say ""reportedly"" and then claim ""in fact"" immediately after. Reportedly means ""according to a report or rumor"". While ""in fact"" means the information is based on data. These types of errors will result in even more C&C deductions in your work. \n Overall, this essay will fail based on several glaring errors, LR, GRA, and C&C problems. You are trying to gain a higher score based on word usage. Unfortunately, you do not have the proper understanding of the meaning of English words to properly use most of them in a coherent sentence. You also lack the basic understanding of how an English sentence is formed, as seen in your incorrect adverb usage at the start of a sentence. \n The word ""Otherwise"" is an adverb used to describe an opposing or alternate presentation to a previous one. As such, you cannot use the word at the start of a paragraph where a topic sentence has yet to establish the content of the paragraph. This is a serious GRA error on your part and shows a lack of English sentence structure rules.","Your essay addresses the topic of home ownership versus renting, which is a good start. However, there are several areas that require improvement to make your argument clearer and more convincing. Here's how you can improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Vocabulary Use:**
   - In your introduction, phrases like ""increasingly prominent role for people"" could be simplified to ""increasingly important"" for clarity. Also, consider using varied vocabulary such as ""homeownership"" instead of repeating ""ownership"" and ""leasing"" in place of ""rent"" to demonstrate a wider range of language skills.
   - The phrase ""feasibly prone to advantageous position"" is confusing. It would be clearer to say ""homeownership can be beneficial."" Remember, using simpler and correct vocabulary is often more effective than attempting to use complex words incorrectly.

2. **Accuracy and Appropriate Word Choice:**
   - Avoid using incorrect terms such as ""rent house."" The correct terms are ""rented houses"" or ""rentals.""
   - Be cautious with word choice to ensure accuracy. For example, ""reportedly"" and ""in fact"" have distinct meanings and should not be used together as it creates confusion. Aim for using words whose meanings you are sure of to avoid misinterpretation.

3. **Sentence Structure and Grammar:**
   - Your essay would benefit from more varied sentence structures to make it more engaging. Also, pay attention to grammar rules, especially the use of articles (""an apartment"" instead of ""apartment"") and plurals.

4. **Logic and Cohesion:**
   - The use of ""Otherwise"" to start a new paragraph is not appropriate because it suggests a contrast that has not been clearly established in your writing. Instead, use transition phrases that correctly introduce your ideas and help the flow between paragraphs.
   - Ensure your arguments are logically presented and supported with specific examples or reasons. When discussing the benefits of homeownership, clearly outline these benefits before moving on to the next idea to avoid jumping from one point to another without sufficient explanation.

5. **Strengthening Your Argument:**
   - Your point of view is somewhat clear, but your arguments would be stronger with more detailed examples and a clearer explanation of how homeownership leads to benefits like increased privacy and productivity. For each point you make, ask yourself, ""How?"" and ""Why?"" to deepen your analysis.

Remember, your essay's strength lies in its clarity, coherence, and the accuracy of language use. Focusing on these areas will not only improve your writing but also make your argument more persuasive and engaging.",4,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

While distributing a significant amount to health education and prevention is of great importance, treatment is a better investment. \n Firstly, serious illness are unavoidable. For instance, cancer can randomly affect anyone, including people who has the most intensive knowledge on health and the healthiest lifeste. Therefore, it would be pointless to divert a bigger fund to health education if such diseases exists. \n Secondly, the society is already aware of what and what not to avoid. Basic hygiene and a healthy lifestyle have already been embedded to them growing up. It is a matter in which a person will follow it or not. \n Finally, the price of treatment is much expensive than health education and prevention. Therefore, if budget would be limited, treatment would definitely be compromised, since funds will run out faster. \n In conclusion, a country's budget on health can greatly affect the population. Though both health related education and treatment needs funds, it cannot be denied that the latter is the better choice ldue to the statements provided above.","Dear student, this essay does not follow the required parameters of an IELTS Task 2 essay. All of your paragraphs do not fall under the required minimum 3 sentences in order to qualify as a full paragraph under the C&C scoring criteria. The opening paraphrase is incomplete (Btw, you are required to give us a copy of the original prompt for our analysis and comparison with your work. Please do that with your next essay) . All of your paragraphs have under developed discussion statements and do not really inform the reader in a complete manner. Your essay does not feel like you thoroughly analyzed the given prompt because all of your responses are short summaries. It is almost as if you are afraid to develop your discussions into a full length form. This is not the kind of essay that would pass in an actual test setting. Since this is your first essay, you have room for improvement. It is important that you learn how to properly develop your opening statement, your discussion process, and your concluding paragraph. Looking at and reading the examples for various IELTS Task 2 essays that are posted here will help you familiarize yourself with the essay requirements.","Your essay addresses the significant issue of prioritizing health budget allocation between education, prevention, and cure. While you chose a clear stance, favoring treatment, there are several areas to improve to meet the standards expected in an essay, especially for English proficiency tests like the IELTS.

1. **Response to Topic**: Ensure your essay directly and thoroughly addresses the topic given. Your essay seems to miss a complete introduction to the topic which sets the stage for your arguments. Including the original prompt in your essay preparation can help you and the reviewers verify that your essay aligns well with the topic.

2. **Structure and Development**: Each paragraph in your essay should consist of at least three sentences to be considered complete. This helps in thoroughly developing your ideas. Your paragraphs currently lack depth and detail, providing brief summaries rather than comprehensive discussions. To strengthen your essay, expand on your points with more examples, explanations, and counters to possible arguments against your position.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: While your viewpoint is clear, the reasoning behind it could be made stronger with well-developed arguments. For instance, discussing the inevitability of serious illnesses and the general awareness of healthy lifestyles are good starts but require deeper exploration and evidence to persuade the reader fully.

4. **Grammar and Style**: There are several spelling, grammatical, and stylistic errors throughout the essay. For example:
   - In ""serious illness are unavoidable,"" ""illness"" should be plural (""illnesses"").
   - ""has the most intensive knowledge"" should use ""have"" to agree in number with ""people.""
   - The word ""lifeste"" appears to be a typo; likely, you meant ""lifestyle.""
   - The phrase ""ldue to the statements provided above"" has a typographical error (""ldue""). It should be ""due.""

Consider revising these errors and paying close attention to verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and accurate word choices.

5. **Concluding Thoughts**: Your conclusion summarizes your main points well but could further emphasize the importance of your argument by suggesting implications or recommendations for future policies.

In order to accomplish this role, some parents choose to enroll in a parenting class before baby born. Therefore, it is true that a training course prepares a solid foundation for couples to get ready for the next stage of life. There are two following reasons that outline my points. \n One reason is that course allows you to make mistakes but the real world doesn't. For examples, Some parenting courses are conducted by professionals who can teach you a variety of parenting skills and how to deal with the challenges. As a student, you can learn by doing during the courses. Furthermore, you have opportunities to ask questions if you encounter any challenges. And it doesn't as easy as a learner if you officially become a parent. \n Another reason is that the course gives you a transition before you become a parent. As an adult, we have many roles at one time such as husband, wife, employees, or family's member. It means that our time is limited. As the result, we won't have enough time to commit a course after we encounter the difficulties. \n In conclusion, the parenting course has a variety of benefits that prepare you to become a good mom and dad. It does not only teach you caring skills but also prepare your mindset of the new role. It seems to me very essential to have this learning if I become other's parent in the future.","Dear student, while your discussion points for the reasoning part of the instructions are correct, your response to the prompt instruction is wrong. Let me illustrate the mistake for you in outline form first. I will explain the mistake to you after that. \n Original Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? \n Your Response: Therefore, it is true that a training course prepares a solid foundation for couples to get ready for the next stage of life. \n Your Mistake: Lack of extent response. \n This is an extent essay which requires a emotional response prior to your discussing the reasons for your opinion. Pick only emotional response and then develop your discussion around that. A sample of a proper emotional response for this essay is: \n ... I totally agree with this point of view because... \n ... I am in full agreement with this statement... \n ... I wholeheartedly agree based on the following reasons. \n ... I fully agree... \n Or any variation therefore. I based the samples upon the fact that you reasoning discusses only the agreement opinion of the essay. Therefore, I can say that your work is partially incorrect and will received a partial grade in terms of TA considerations. Partially correct because of the way that you discussed a strong single opinion in the body paragraphs but only partially correct because of the missing response to the prompt discussion instructions.","This essay delves into the importance of parenting courses for prospective parents, presenting two main reasons in support. However, there are several areas that could benefit from improvements to fully align with the essay prompt and enhance overall clarity and impact.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay somewhat addresses the topic by discussing the benefits of parenting classes. However, it misses a crucial aspect by not explicitly stating to what extent you agree or disagree with the importance of these courses. Clarifying your stance with phrases like “I fully agree with the necessity of parenting courses because…” at the beginning would strengthen your position and align closely with the prompt's requirement for an emotional or extent response.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:**
   - There are minor spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity. For instance, “…before baby born” should be “…before the baby is born.”
   - The use of capitalization in “Some parenting courses” is incorrect as “some” should not be capitalized in this context.
   - Consider avoiding contractions such as “doesn't” to maintain a formal tone. Use “does not” instead.
   - The phrase “And it doesn't as easy as a learner if you officially become a parent” is unclear. A clearer rephrasing might be, “Learning as a course participant is easier than learning as a new parent in the real world.”

3. **Point of View of the Essay Author:** Your point of view is implied through your discussion of the benefits of parenting courses, yet it’s not strongly articulated. Clearly stating your personal stance with respect to agreeing or disagreeing will make your viewpoint unmistakable to the reader.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** The arguments presented are relevant, but they could be further strengthened with more specific examples and a deeper exploration of how parenting courses build a solid foundation for future parenting. For instance, elucidate on the types of skills and knowledge gained from these courses and how they specifically prepare one for parenthood.

To improve your essay:
- Start with a clear statement of your extent of agreement or disagreement.
- Address the minor spelling and grammatical errors to enhance readability.
- Use a more formal tone throughout the essay, avoiding contractions and ensuring clear sentence structure.
- Include more specific examples or personal reflections to bolster your arguments, making it easier for the reader to connect with and understand your viewpoint.

I will discuss the case and the effect on relationship between young adult and elder people. \n In a different parts of the world, the people who are born in this so called modern era are more likely to know many things faster than the people who born in a few decades ago, due to the fact that right now there are so many technologies which can provide information and data, or many devices which can help their everday life. In this case for example, at very young age, children when they want to play, are often been introduced to a gadget like a phone tablet, which is just after few times using that device, then they are be able to use them properly. Furthermore in another case,there is a 5 yrs old child is often search some explanation on the internet if he see or hear something from his parent, that will make them having more knowledge than a child on the few decades ago. \n The children who grow up with that often show more power and knowledge when they talk, the impact are when they face a situation which they have to confronted elderly people. When they use many popular languages when talk, the old people who may not understand to this new develop language often get some confusion and may lead to missunderstanding. \n In conclusion, if this kind of situation will continue, there might be some long connection gap of communication between young and old generation in the future.","I will be lenient here and score this a 5 based on the new IELTS Task 2 Scoring system. In the old system, this would have scored a 4. The reason that your score is not so high is because you have a problem expressing yourself coherently in English. It is tremendously difficult to keep track of what you are trying to say and you have grammatical and punctuation errors, such as the lack of full stops and the existence of run - on sentences, that severely affected the message of your essay. As such, I was left with no recourse but to mark you down for those errors crossing the 4 scoring considerations. \n More importantly, you made a severe mistake in the opening paraphrase which led me to realize that you have an understanding of the English language but have poor sentence development skills. Compare what you wrote in the prompt paraphrase to what I have written here, which is the correct version: \n <em>Young people today are perceived to have more power and influence these days than the older generations. While little is understood about why this happens, I will attempt to give an explanation for it in this essay. Additionally, I will analyze what sort of effect such a trend has on the relationship of the young and old generations existing in today's world.</em> \n In your version of the paraphrase, you said the older generation has more influence than the young, which is a reversal of what the original prompt provided. Hence, the mark down in your task accuracy score for that section. However, I considered the rest of the essay and saw that your discussion related to the original prompt so I decided to score it accordingly instead.","The essay focuses on the growing influence of the younger generation due to technological advancements and how this may impact their relationships with older generations. There's a thoughtful consideration of how modern tools and access to information from a young age empower the youth, which aligns with the essay's topic. However, to improve the essay and make the arguments more effective, specific feedback targeting different areas is provided.

Firstly, regarding the response to the topic, there seems to be a confusion in the opening statement about which age group holds more strength and influence, which might lead to a misunderstanding of the essay's aim. It's essential to clearly state that young people today are seen as having more power and influence compared to older generations, and why this change might be significant. Stating the essay's intention more clearly will help convey the message effectively.

The essay has several spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. Run-on sentences and the absence of proper punctuation make the essay difficult to follow. Shortening long sentences and using full stops to break up thoughts can greatly enhance readability and coherence. Also, paying attention to verb tenses and ensuring noun-verb agreement will improve the grammatical accuracy of the essay.

The author's point of view is somewhat clear as the essay does outline how technological adeptness possibly elevates the younger generation's status. However, making the thesis statement more explicit in the introduction and concluding the essay with a stronger summary of the points discussed would further clarify the stance.

While the essay attempts to support the author's point of view with examples, such as the use of gadgets by children and their consequent knowledge gain, these arguments could be more descriptive and detailed. Expanding on how these technologies specifically influence communication and relationships between generations would strengthen the essay's position. Additionally, providing clear examples or evidence of misunderstandings or conflicts that arise due to these generational differences would make the arguments more convincing.

In conclusion, focusing on developing clearer and more grammatically coherent sentences, accurately introducing and concluding the essay, and providing more detailed arguments with specific examples will significantly improve the essay's effectiveness.

However, I am not in agreement with this idea. \n The first reason for this is that using the Internet for learning without any direction from the teacher is simply unrealistic. The teacher is not only a person who teaches at school but also a tour guide on the learning journey of students who are willing to answer all the questions for them. The school also connect pupils' study path and their family and provide students' situation if they are learning well or badly at school for parents, something the internet cannot do. For example, if parents are too busy to make money, they will want to know their child's learning situation through the teachers since then giving appropriate adjustments to their child. \n In addition to the concern above, I also believe that learning from the Internet is impossible. With the sharp development, there are too many facts and figures for one topic on the platform, which confuses searching for the student. Moreover, all the data on the internet is not always correct, this may lead to some misunderstandings and mistakes in students' knowledge which bring negative consequences for their future.

The structure of your arguments is easy to follow, and your stance is consistent throughout the essay. Nevertheless, there are areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity, depth, and persuasiveness of your argument.

1. **Response to Topic:** You've appropriately addressed the essay question by discussing the irreplaceable role of schools compared to the internet. However, introducing a thesis statement at the end of your introductory paragraph would strengthen your argument. A thesis statement clearly outlines your main points, guiding the reader through your essay and reinforcing your position.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Overall, your essay is readable, but attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and punctuation will improve its quality. For example, use an apostrophe for possessive nouns (e.g., ""pupil's"" instead of ""pupils' study path"" when referring to the study path of one pupil, or ""pupils'"" when referring to more than one). Also, consider revising phrases that may cause confusion due to word choice, such as ""which confuses searching."" Instead, clarify the meaning by explaining that the abundance of information on the internet can make learning challenging because students may struggle to find accurate and reliable sources.

3. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** Your essay provides a good foundation by offering two main reasons schools are deemed essential. Yet, to make your essay more compelling, delve deeper into these reasons with more examples, evidence, or explanations. Enhancing your arguments with specific instances or more detailed explanations can better support your viewpoint.

4. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view is clear, but it can be made stronger with the inclusion of a thesis statement as mentioned before. A thesis statement will not only assert your stance early on but also serve as the backbone for your arguments, making your position unequivocal throughout the essay.

In addition to these points, consider varying your sentence structure to create a more engaging and dynamic text. This approach can make an essay more interesting to read and can convey your ideas more effectively.

On the contrary, others dispute that humans must utilize animals to fulfill their various demands, including uses for nutriment and experimentation. This essay will discuss both views. \n With regards to the exploitation of animals, people believe it is acceptable for few reasons. Firstly, scientist develop method to mitigate pain and discomfort suffered by animals during scientific experiment. For instance, injection of drug on animals carried out by researcher before inception of experimentation. Furthermore, make use of animal is crucial to invent new medicine to cure illness. This is because when a new drug or surgical technique developed, many believe that it is unethical to use first on human-being as it may cause harm rather than good. Instead, the drug and technique is tested in animals to ensure that it is safe and effective. \n However, many people disagree employment of animals for human needs. Firstly, it is unnecessary to kill animals for food. A healthy diet is possible without eating meat. For instance, human could get adequate nutrients from nut, seed, soy product , vegetable and fruit. Secondly, the lives of animal s should be respected. Animals are also living creatures in the earth, and as such animals deserved rights to be respected. That is to say animals have consciousness and empathy, like human-beings possess.

I am not sure if you have actually completed the essay based on the proper instructions at this point. So the only parts that I can review here will be the opening statement and the conclusion as those do not require instruction guidelines as the body of the essay does. \n Your opening statement is a confusing paraphrase of the original.

You did not do that so the essay is open ended instead of concluded.","The essay presented discusses the contentious issue of whether animals should be granted rights similar to humans and not utilized for human needs such as nutrition and experimentation. While the essay attempts to cover both viewpoints on the topic, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

1. **Response to Topic:** It seems the essay is attempting to address a significant and debatable topic regarding animal rights and their use by humans. However, without the original prompt, it's challenging to ascertain how well the essay aligns with the specific instructions or question. For future essays, ensure that the discussion aligns closely with the given instructions or questions. This will make your argument more focused and relevant.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay displays several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that can detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing. For example, phrases like ""in number of people think"" should be revised to ""an increasing number of people think."" Additionally, ensure that plural and singular forms are used correctly (e.g., ""scientist develop method"" should be ""scientists develop methods""). Simplifying sentence structures and using a grammar checker can greatly improve readability and accuracy.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view becomes clear by the conclusion, where you express agreement with the stance that humans should not exploit animals. However, embedding your viewpoint more consistently throughout the essay, especially when introducing each argument, would strengthen its persuasive effect and coherence.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** While the essay presents arguments for both sides, it tends to generalize rather than provide specificity and depth. For instance, when mentioning alternatives to animal-derived nutrition, providing statistical evidence, authoritative sources, or more detailed examples would enhance your argument's credibility. Similarly, when discussing the importance of animal experimentation, elaborating on ethical considerations and the scientific process of ensuring safety and effectiveness would offer a more nuanced perspective.

Finally, the concluding paragraph should succinctly summarize the main points discussed without introducing new personal opinions. It's aimed at reinforcing the arguments made, thus providing a strong closure to the essay. Instead of stating a new opinion, recap the discussion to ensure the essay feels complete and resolved.

While some people believe that it should be parents' choice to select the vaccination for their children, I would agree with those who argue that neccessity of vaccination for children should be enforced by the law. \n Firstly, important procedure such as vaccination should not be left with for an individual to decide as they are bound to carelessness. This is because a number of parents avoid the hassle of visiting doctors and spending money with the preception in mind that their children would not catch the disease. This type of behaviour has resulted in big countries like India suffering from the large scale epidemics in the past. Recent survey stated that India would have never gotten rid of Polio if the government hadnot mandated the Vaccine For All Initiative in which every Indian citizenA was given Polio Vaccine at their homes. \n Furthermore, it is a natural acceptance of human to only stay updated with concerns that they are interested in or are enforced with. For instance, 2019 census stated that 70% parents in india were not aware about the names of relevant vaccines needed for their child. Hence, their children had only underwent vaccines that were mandated by the govt. Conversely, if the government had not mandated the vaccination procedures for children and youngsters, it would be unsurmountable to vanish the proliferation of life threatening diseases. \n In brief, I believe vaccination should be mandated by law as individual's decisions are prone to lack of knowledge and avoidance of related hassles which can have devastating affects for child and nation as whole.","Your discussion is not grammatically perfect.

However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay does respond to the given topic effectively. You have chosen a clear stance and presented arguments to support that stance. To strengthen your response further, consider exploring counterarguments briefly and addressing why the opposing viewpoint might be less valid or effective. This will showcase your critical thinking skills and provide a more comprehensive discussion.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** While your essay is generally understandable, there are several errors in grammar, spelling, and sentence formation. For instance, ""neccessity"" should be spelled ""necessity"", and ""hadnot"" should be written as ""had not"". Additionally, sentences like ""important procedure such as vaccination should not be left with for an individual to decide"" could be clearer and grammatically correct. Consider revising to ""important procedures such as vaccinations should not be left for individuals to decide"". Paying attention to these details will make your writing more professional and easier to follow.

3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view is clear throughout the essay, which is a strength. You maintain a consistent stance on the importance of mandated vaccinations. To enhance this clarity, ensure every paragraph contributes directly to supporting your central argument, avoiding any tangential content.

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** Your arguments are descriptive and mostly well-supported. To improve, ensure that each argument directly ties back to how it supports the enforcement of vaccinations by law. Providing more data or studies, similar to the polio example, could further strengthen your arguments.

Your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a persuasive argument. Focusing on correcting grammatical and spelling errors will make your writing more polished. Additionally, exploring counterarguments and providing even more evidence for your claims can make your essay more compelling.

Although it shows that you know how to use certain English phrases, word fillers are often the cause of phrase usage errors among ESL students. An ENL speaker does not rely on word fillers for their written or spoken English. Speak direct to the point. Utilize the use of topic sentences rather than word fillers to start your paragraph. That way the reader immediately gets an idea of what the discussion in that paragraph will be about. \n You are also relying too much on the use of commas in the presentation of your ideas. Ideas are better presented using a mix of punctuation marks. The most commonly used is the period or the full stop. That indicates a complete thought process in a sentence. Avoid using 2 ideas in one sentence. That creates a run-on presentation. You may use an Oxford comma only to list connected words in a list such as ; Harvard,Oxford, or Stanford. \n While it is nice to see that you have an ""advanced"" English vocabulary of sorts, the use of these archaic words make the essay sound unnatural. You should practice using everyday English words, phrases, and other colloquialisms. This will show a more practical side to the way you use the English language. You will also score better in the international English tests when you show this natural ability to write in English. \n You have good reasoning in this essay. The grammar may not be perfect but you still managed to explain yourself in an understandable manner. You should brush up on your sentence exercises to learn more about how to naturally format an English sentence.","The essay you've written importantly addresses the topic of why there's a growing trend of students taking standardized English exams such as TOEFL, IELTS, or TOEIC. The reasons provided for this trend are clear and support your view well. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your arguments stronger and your writing clearer.

First, consider minimizing the use of phrases like ""First and foremost,"" ""Last but not least,"" and ""In conclusion."" While these phrases can structure your essay, they sometimes act more as fillers than as useful transitions. Try to start your paragraphs directly with the main idea or point you're discussing. This approach will make your writing more direct and easier to follow.

Regarding punctuation, there's a noticeable over-reliance on commas, which can lead to run-on sentences. Breaking down complex ideas into shorter, more concise sentences can enhance the clarity and readability of your essay. Using a variety of punctuation marks, such as periods (full stops), semi-colons, and colons, can help articulate your thoughts more clearly and control the pace of your writing more effectively.

Your vocabulary demonstrates your command of English, yet at times, the use of less common or outdated words and phrases can distract from your message. Strive for simplicity and clarity in your word choice. Utilizing everyday language will make your essay more natural and relatable, potentially improving your score on English exams by demonstrating practical language usage.

While your grammar is generally understandable, paying attention to sentence structure and variety can further improve your writing. Engaging in sentence practice exercises will help you craft more natural and effective English sentences, enhancing overall comprehension.

In summary, your essay successfully communicates your viewpoints on the increasing trend of taking standardized English examinations. By focusing on expressing your thoughts directly, simplifying your language, varying your punctuation, and refining your sentence structures, your essays will become more effective and engaging. These improvements will not only aid in achieving higher scores on language proficiency exams but also in making your written English more accessible and enjoyable to read.",4,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

The cause of this phenomenon are varied, and this may lead to many detrimental effects on the young generation as a whole. \n Current heavy workload from school and and tempting contemporary techonology are identified to be the two main reasons. Firstly, children nowadays are too occupied with their studies to socialize with their friends on top of constant examinations. Additionally, high expectations from parents on their studies also lead to stress and pressure for their children, which may isolate them from friends. Secondly, the rapid development of modern technology which engenders many new sources of entertainment and social media such as Facebook may mitigate the amount of time for interpersonal activities. As these new benefits from technology may be addictive to some extent, real life relationships establishments might also be neglected. \n As a matter of fact, this trend is having apparently deleterious impact on children's development. In terms of their social life, as they have rare interactions with others, this may result in highly limited communication skills, which can hinder their future careers. Furthermore, lack of socializing could be the reason for many mental illnesses. Owing to the time allocated for studying, which renders children incapable of leaving their desk so as to communicate with others, children may suffer from a deteriorating immobile lifestyle or even autism. \n In conclusion, the negative effects of seclusion on children may result in the deterioration in social lives and many diseases. Understandings of the causes and impacts should stimulate parents to take proper remidial steps in order to prevent and resolve such problems.","while your vocabulary is impressive, the fact that your paragraphs are not completely developed in terms of reasoning leaves the paragraph less informative than it should be. That is because you are only providing reasons without complete justifications through the use of explanatory sentences and examples to substantiate your claims. Therefore, the total essay can be deemed, less developed than it should be. This is further highlighted by your run-on sentence in the opening paraphrase which should have been presented as a 3 sentence paragraph instead. This is a direct response essay so the reasons and your opinion should have been indicated as part of the opening paraphrase. \n When you read the original prompt, note how many sentences it took to present the discussion, reason, and instructions, then make sure that you present the same number of sentences in your paraphrase to totally portray a clear idea of comprehension and sentence development abilities. I would have written this in the following manner: \n <em>With children developing less of a socialized form of playtime these days, it has been perceived that this action has had a connection with their overall development. One reason for this is because they can play online and interact with other players in the same way. I believe that this has negative influence on the children.</em> \n The paraphrase I wrote responds, per sentence to the following: \n 1. Paraphrase of the topic sentence. \n 2. A clear reason for the development based on the first direct question. \n 3. A personal opinion in response to the second direct question. \n Those are the elements of the response that the examiner will immediately look for in your opening paraphrase. So these should be clearly presented in the paragraph paraphrase and connected response. \n The way the original prompt was written indicates a 4 paragraph response is required. Therefore, your response should contain only the following: \n 1. Paraphrase \n 2. Single reason with properly developed explanation over 3-5 sentences. \n 3. Explanation as to why this is a bad/negative effect. \n 4. Concluding summary comprised of the prompt restatement, reason, explanation, and closing sentence. \n In every task 2 essay, you should never focus on several discussion points in one paragraph. You are not scored on knowledge of the topic. You are scored only on your ability to make yourself understood as you explain your reasons for supporting a particular aspect of the discussion. In this instance, your essay tries to present several reasons with little developed explanation, which forced you to write run-on sentences, which will have a direct effect on the C&C and GRA scoring considerations of your essay. Mostly because of the lack of clarity behind the reasons in each paragraph. \n Based on those reasons, I believe that you can score a 5 - 5.5 due to lack of progression in the discussion and lack of idea development in every paragraph.","The essay provides an insightful look into how decreased socialization among children is impacting their development. It highlights important causes such as heavy academic workload and the allure of modern technology, as well as the consequences these factors have on children's social skills and mental health. However, there are areas that require improvements to make the essay more effective and cohesive.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the topic, outlining causes and consequences of decreased socialization among children. However, the initial paragraph could be structured more clearly to immediately present the topic, your reasons, and your personal viewpoint. Like the example given, starting with a clear paraphrase of the issue, followed by a reason, and then your opinion, would make your introduction more impactful and set a solid foundation for your argument.

2. **Spellings, Grammar, and Style**: Watch out for spelling mistakes (""techonology"" should be ""technology"", ""remidial"" should be ""remedial"") and grammar issues. For example, ""the cause of this phenomenon are varied"" should be ""the causes of this phenomenon are varied"". Additionally, avoid run-on sentences by breaking up lengthy sentences into shorter, more precise ones. This will make your essay clearer and easier to follow.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While your point of view is implied, making it explicitly clear in your introduction and conclusion can strengthen your argument. Explicitly stating your opinion gives your essay a more persuasive edge.

4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay mentions significant points but lacks detailed explanations and examples to fully support the claims. Each paragraph should focus on developing a single reason with clear explanations over several sentences. Instead of listing reasons or consequences, dive deeper into each point with explanations or examples. This will help in thoroughly developing your ideas and providing a persuasive argument.

5. **Paragraph Structure and Cohesion**: The essay could benefit from a more structured approach, following a four-paragraph model: an introduction paraphrase, a developed explanation of a single reason, explanation of negative effects, and a concluding summary. This structure will help in maintaining focus and ensuring that each point is adequately developed.

6. **Overall Cohesiveness and Development**: The essay attempts to cover several points but lacks depth in development due to the presentation of multiple ideas with limited explanations. Focusing on developing one idea at a time will avoid run-on sentences and clarify your reasoning, thus enhancing coherence and cohesion.

To improve, concentrate on structuring your essay more effectively, ensuring clarity of your viewpoint, and developing your arguments with comprehensive explanations and examples. Paying attention to spelling and grammar will also enhance the quality of your writing. Remember, the objective is not only to inform but to persuade through well-supported and clearly articulated arguments.",3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4469,https://essayforum.com/writing/way-reduce-amount-traffic-cities-reducing-94285/,test,The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need of commuting,"It is certainly true that traffic congestion has become a major problem, especially in big cities throughout the world. This is obvious from the number of vehicles on our roads and the amount of pollution they cause. This effect is probably due to individuals travelling for work, education and shopping. We can see this in the rush hours we experience every morning and evening. \n It is also true that it is not necessary to daily commuting for work or study thanks to the rapid growth of technology. This advanced developments facilitate everyone can work from home as well as students can enroll distance learning courses with purpose of reducing traffic jam. Moreover, housekeepers can purchase all things they want by just a click on their smartphones. Everything is available on the internet that makes our life better and easier. \n Even though everyone has right to access internet, there are a number of potential risks. People can work from home, but it is unrealistic to think they would all want to. In addition, people are less sociable because of lack of contact with each others and students are not under direct observance by their teachers which can lead to distract in their study. \n In conclusion, I think while this practice could reduce the traffic problems in our cities, it is most unlikely to be an acceptable solution. In terms of other solutions, perhaps we need to encourage people to use public transports and limit private cars in city center. And government must consider other plans that widen roads with sky trams, subways or other acceptable alternative measure to reduce traffic jams on our roads.","The essay is all set to receive a failing mark. There can be no other consideration for this discussion since it does not respond to the task question which is ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?""

As such, you cannot be given a passing discussion consideration score. You failed the essay on 2 counts: \n 1. Failure to use the correct response format \n 2. Response is unrelated to the task \n There was a misunderstanding of what the writing task was on your part. Which is why your response does not coincide with the given original prompt. It is for these reasons that your essay cannot be given a passing mark even as you gave valid explanations and examples in your discussion paragraphs.","Final Feedback:

This essay aims to address the issue of traffic congestion in big cities, exploring its causes and suggesting potential solutions, such as the use of technology for remote work and study, as well as advocating for public transportation and infrastructure improvements. However, there are key areas where this essay can be improved to more effectively meet the requirements of the English proficiency test.

1. **Adherence to the Topic**: The primary issue with this essay is that it doesn't directly answer the test prompt, which asks to what extent you agree or disagree with a given statement. Instead, the essay shifts focus to discussing the causes of traffic congestion and proposes solutions. To improve, it is crucial to directly address the prompt by clearly stating whether you agree or disagree with the statement given and then using the essay to support that viewpoint.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that could be streamlined for clarity. For example, ""advanced developments facilitate everyone can work from home"" could be revised to ""advanced developments make it possible for everyone to work from home."" Paying closer attention to the use of singular and plural forms, tense consistency, and sentence structure will help improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While you touch upon several interesting points, your personal standpoint on the issue is not clearly expressed. Establishing a clear thesis statement at the beginning of your essay that reflects your position will make your argument more compelling and coherent.

4. **Support for Arguments**: The essay includes some general examples to support the discussion, such as the benefits of remote work and online shopping in reducing traffic. However, these arguments need to be more detailed and directly linked to your main thesis. Providing specific data, real-world examples, or hypothetical scenarios could strengthen your position and make your argument more persuasive.

To enhance your essay, begin by clearly stating your position in response to the essay prompt. Then, organize your arguments around this position, ensuring that each paragraph presents a clear point that supports your viewpoint. Focus on refining your grammar, style, and clarity for better readability. Finally, enrich your arguments with more concrete examples or evidence to substantiate your claims.

Improving these aspects will not only make your essay more responsive to the prompt but also more engaging and persuasive to the reader. Remember, direct engagement with the question posed and clear communication of your ideas are key to a successful essay.",3,3,3,2,3,3,4,2,3,1,Argumentative

This phenomenon has affected the society in various ways, and in my opinion, there are both positive and negative effects. \n There are a variety of reasons why members of modern society support this trend. Firstly, marriage might undergo some unexpected things such as divorce, domestic violence, and huge costs to bring children up, which creates fear of getting married amongst the young generation. Therefore, the youths lean toward the idea of individualism instead of collectivism. Another important factor that contributes to the trend is the generation gap. In other words, different opinions between the young and the old would be the main culprit of unnecessary conflict, which can act as a catalyst for stressful family environment. \n On the one hand, this development can be extremely positive. That there would be a decline in population growth rate will help to prevent fierce competition that is the breeding ground of social unrest and political instability. Furthermore, as living in small families, parents will take better care of their children who will be the future pillars of the nation. On the other hand, the shortage of young workforce is the negative consequence that can be anticipated. As a result, we will likely to witness an unsustainable growth in economic and general prosperity of the countries in the future. \n In conclusion, individualism and nuclear families have impacted many aspects of the society by both its benefits and drawbacks.","Dear student, in terms of grammatical presentation, you know just enough English vocabulary to create coherent, but not necessarily cohesive, sentences. Your ideas are presented in a manner that the reader can understand, even though the grammar is not perfect. The degree of English writing skill you display is intermediate, which is a good thing. The intermediate level means that you are able to present simple to complex sentences a few times in the essay. However, the fact that you are not focused on developing only one idea for representation in each paragraph means that you did not fully utilize these writing skills of yours. \n The lack of cohesiveness in the presentation, due to the numerous topics being discussed per paragraph, caused a faulty development of ideas. You did not manage to fully discuss and explain your line of reasoning per paragraph. It would be best if you focused less on informing the reader using numerous examples and instead, focus on fully developing one or two pieces of evidence in individual paragraphs. That way, the paragraph becomes both coherent and cohesive. You have 3 body paragraphs within which to do this so I suggest you fully utilize the opportunity to do so. Presenting a solidly developed 5 paragraph essay will be beneficial to you because such a presentation will garner you a higher final scoring consideration. \n In relation to that, I have to say that your first paragraph paraphrase needs more work. It is not a very accurate representation of all the instructions from the original prompt. It would have been better presented as: \n <em>Developing countries tend to have smaller family units these days. There is a tendency for people to live either alone or with a nucleus family instead. I believe that there are 2 major reasons for this development. In this essay, I will shed light on those 2 reasons, as well as the possible results that these new family units have on our society.</em> \n The above representation is more aligned with the original prompt discussion and allows the reader to get a better idea of what topics will be discussed, why it will be discussed, and how it will be discussed. This would indicate a higher level of English thinking and writing on your part. \n The concluding paragraph needs to be more than one sentence. Try to write at least 3 sentences in each paragraph because you are trying to impress the examiner with your English writing and grammar abilities. That is not well represented when you only write one sentence. The better you write in multiple short sentences, the better your chance of a better grammatical score.","Your essay is indeed responding to the topic, discussing the shift towards nuclear families and individualism due to societal development, along with its positive and negative impacts. Your viewpoint is clear, and you offer arguments for both sides of the issue, which is commendable.

To improve your essay, consider the following points:

1. **Focus on Cohesion and Coherence:**
   Your essay presents ideas using a range of vocabulary and sentence structures, showing an intermediate level of English proficiency. However, your sentences, while coherent, lack cohesion, making it challenging to see how your ideas connect smoothly. To enhance cohesion, try to focus on developing one or two main ideas per paragraph rather than jumping between many topics. This practice will not only make your essay more coherent but also more in-depth and engaging for the reader.

2. **Paragraph Development:**
   The essay introduces several important points but often lacks detailed development of these ideas. To strengthen your argument, choose one or two key pieces of evidence or examples per paragraph and elaborate on these in greater detail. This approach will help to create a more robust and focused argument, giving each paragraph a clear purpose and message.

3. **Introduction and Conclusion:**
   The introductory paragraph could more accurately reflect the essay prompt by outlining the specific reasons and consequences you will discuss. A revised introduction might provide a clearer roadmap for the reader. For your conclusion, extending it beyond a single sentence to summarize your key points and reflect on the implications of your argument will leave a stronger final impression on the reader. Aim for at least three sentences to give your conclusion the weight it deserves.

4. **Grammatical Accuracy:**
   While your grammar allows for an understandable presentation of ideas, paying more attention to grammatical precision could enhance the clarity and professionalism of your essay. Shorter, more concise sentences can often help in achieving better grammatical accuracy and making your argument more accessible.

In summary, your essay effectively addresses the topic with a clear stance and supportive arguments. For improvement, focus on developing your ideas more fully within cohesive and coherent paragraphs, refine your introduction and conclusion, and work on grammatical precision.

Some arguments said that contemporary houses should be in accordance with the old. The others contend that people should be allowed to decide what they want. In my opinion, the second one is more reasonable. \n Sometimes, the new houses ought to be built following the old model due to the locality's landscape. It would be unimaginable if there was a modern building among a row of the ancient structure houses. For example, Hoi An city in Vietnam is a famous destination for the architecture value of tradition from a few centuries ago. Therefore, the authority should limit the emerging of the odd style buildings, compare with coherent ones.

That is different from ""arguments"" which means ""a fact for or against a point."" Since there are no facts being presented but only considerations, ""arguments"" is not the correct descriptive word to use. \n You are providing a singular point of view in this essay when the discussion requires the use of a public explanation first (discuss both points of view) and then the presentation of the personal opinion (give your opinion) after the comparison is completed. So the essay does not reflect a discussion based on the proper formatting requirements. You should understand that this type of essay requires an additional presentation on your part.

However, the introduction uses the term ""arguments"" in a way that might not accurately convey the original prompt's intention, which is more about considerations than factual arguments. It's important to closely align with the prompt's wording and intent to ensure clarity and accuracy right from the start.

Moving into the body paragraphs, the essay presents perspectives on maintaining traditional styles in certain contexts and the benefits of allowing for modern, eco-friendly designs. These points are valuable, but the essay leans more towards presenting a singular viewpoint rather than equally discussing both sides before introducing a personal stance. To improve, it would be beneficial to dedicate equal attention to explaining why some might favor traditional styles, then contrast this with the advantages of modern designs, before concluding with a personal opinion. This approach not only adheres to the task's requirements but also demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the issue from multiple angles.

Regarding language and style, the essay generally maintains clear communication but grapples with some spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. Paying close attention to the proper use of English, including punctuation marks and avoiding exaggerated claims, is crucial. Additionally, varying the use of pronouns to distinguish between the general discussion and your own opinion can enhance the clarity and impact of your argument.

To further develop the arguments, consider incorporating more specific examples and evidence. While Hoi An city is an excellent example, adding comparable instances or data supporting modern designs' environmental and economic benefits could strengthen the argument. Descriptive and vivid language can also help make the essay more engaging and persuasive.

In conclusion, the essay touches on an interesting debate and presents a clear stance. Improvements can be made by ensuring a balanced discussion of both views before stating a personal opinion, refining the language and grammar, and supporting arguments with detailed examples and evidence.

Stick to one reason and fully develop it, do not change discussions midstream. That is not going to help your score. You did not accurately explain your meaning when you added that information at the end of the paragraph. \n The final paragraph, the concluding statement, is discussing additional information. Don't do that. The closing statement should merely restate the discussion topic, repeat your opinion, and then summarize the discussion points in order to remind the reader of the overall discussion. That will serve as the closing statement for the essay. No information should be discussed because you are only allowed 3 body paragraphs with which to discuss information related to the topic. You cannot go beyond that number of paragraphs for reasoning in a Task 2 essay.","The essay explores the idea that the government should raise taxes on fast food to reduce health risks associated with its consumption. The stance is clear, supporting the policy due to its benefits for consumer health, the healthcare system, and public awareness about fast food.

Firstly, the introduction of the essay could be improved by breaking down the long opening statement into shorter sentences. This will help to introduce the topic more clearly, outline what the essay will discuss, and how it will be discussed.

In terms of expressing opinions, it is important to remember that the essay reflects the author's views. Therefore, using the first person (""I think"", ""I agree"") is more appropriate for stating your agreement or opinion on the subject matter. This small change will make your position clearer to the reader.

There was a minor error with the use of “consumers' health” – the correct form should be ""consumers"" for the plural without the apostrophe, which suggests possession. Pay attention to small grammatical details as they can affect the clarity of your message.

In discussing your points, try to focus and fully develop one idea at a time. Jumping between different ideas within the same paragraph can confuse readers. For example, when discussing the health benefits of reducing fast food consumption, stick to explaining this point thoroughly before moving to another argument.

The essay would benefit from a more refined conclusion. The final paragraph is an opportunity to reiterate your thesis, summarize your main points, and reinforce your stance. Avoid introducing new information or arguments in the conclusion as it can divert attention from the main discussion. The goal of the conclusion is to remind the reader of what has been discussed and to leave a strong, final impression of your position.

Additionally, making sure each paragraph has a clear main idea and supporting sentences will strengthen the essay's structure and coherence. Providing specific examples or data can also help bolster your arguments.

Overall, your essay does a good job of addressing the topic and presenting arguments in favor. With improved structuring, clearer expression of personal opinion, focused development of ideas, and careful attention to grammar, your essay will become even more effective in conveying your message.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

Only general comments and reviews can be made in your essay because of the lack of prompt and discussion requirements. \n You definitely are a fast typist. You have proven that in this essay. However, typing 326 words does not impress the examiner because you typed fast, but failed to check your essay for errors in grammar and spelling. So, writing a long essay became futile because you did not ensure that you would leave time to edit, proofread, and content check your essay for accuracy. You would still get score lowering deductions. It is more important to write well, not write lengthily. Length does not equal perfect writing. Length normally indicates faulty writing because you did not allot time to review your essay within the 40 minutes allotted.

You could go directly to: ""the number of teenagers giving up studying or involving in illegal activities has been going up dramatically..."" This presentation kicks off a clear topic sentence, without the confusion of your misrepresented opinion at the start. The topic is more important than the word fillers used. \n You forgot that the conclusion requires you to present the topic restatement, discussion points, and final opinion. It is never a single sentence because you have to present the reverse paraphrase of the original discussion. That is at least 3 sentences long as well.","The essay presents a discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of living in a modern world, which is a relevant topic. However, it is essential to precisely understand the prompts or topics when writing an essay. Without a clear prompt, it becomes challenging to assess the essay's accuracy and relevance fully. 

One of the strengths observed in the essay is the ability to generate content at a considerable pace. However, the quality of writing, including grammar, style, and spelling, demands as much attention as the quantity of the words. An essential part of writing is to review and edit the work to eliminate errors that could lower the overall score. Dedicating time towards the end of the writing process for reviewing could significantly improve the quality of the essay. 

Notable spelling errors include ""evidence"" misspelled as ""envidence"" and inconsistencies in using British or American English spellings, such as ""color"" instead of ""colour."" It is crucial to maintain consistency in spelling conventions throughout the essay. 

There are several grammatical issues that need addressing. For example, ""widespreading"" should be corrected to ""spreading widely"" to convey the intended meaning correctly. Also, phrases like ""evidence, it"" require proper spacing after commas for clarity and correctness. 

A misunderstanding in word choice is observed with the misuse of ""word"" instead of ""world,"" significantly affecting the essay's clarity. Similarly, using ""cannot be denied"" instead of ""can be denied"" alters the intended meaning of sentences and should be carefully considered to accurately reflect the author's viewpoint.

When referring to reports or evidence, it’s recommended to seamlessly integrate these into the essay without specifying unclear sources. Starting with a clear topic sentence could enhance the argument's clarity and impact, avoiding potential confusion.

Lastly, the conclusion of an essay should comprehensively summarize the discussion, restating the topic, outlining the main points made, and concluding with the author's final stance. A robust conclusion typically consists of at least three sentences to effectively encapsulate the discussion. 

Improving these aspects could enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall impact of the essay, making the author's point of view and arguments more persuasive and understandable to the reader.",3,3,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Personally, I think that although this solution does benefit the traffic in some ways, it would be unworkable and there are more acceptable methods. \n Although distant working and shopping have been more and more popular these day, reducing the need for people to commute is impractical. No matter how efficiently technology allow people to work, study or carry out only transactions, most of us still prefer face-to-face interations, perpetuating the need to travel. For example, business choose to hold direct meetings in lieu of online meetings, except during the covid 19 pandemic, since face-to-face interactions enable them to discuss more clearly and effectively, not to mention tons of disadvantages of distant working. Therefore, with our society still putting a significant amount of importance on real life day-to-day conversations and interactions, the proposed scheme would not work. \n Instead of gorvernment reducing the need for people to commute daily, facilitating public tranport may be a more superior alternative solution. If people choose public transport to travel, not only does it help to commute without causing congestion, but it also reduces the amout of emission released from private vehicles. Take Japan as an example, by investing significantly in building elevated and underground railways, Japan has managed to reduce traffic volume considerably, easing congestion on road. As a result, by upgrading facilities of puplic transport, people will be more encouraged to use and thus, protect the atmostphere. \n In conclusion, although reducing the need of people's daily commuting to alleviate traffic is beneficial to some extents, I am convinced that improving public transport has more advantages that are worth consideration \n @nnlinh2610","This is an extent essay that requires the writer to define his response based on the measured / emotional descriptions often associated with this prompt.

He does not indicate the degree of his disagreement with the statement and the reasons for this disagreement. \n Therefore, the essay has not met the task accuracy requirements as required for the prompt restatement + writer's opinion section. That paragraph will meet with a failing preliminary TA score. The lack of clear opinion and proper response format has already doomed the final score to a failing one.

However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and adherence to the prompt's requirements. Below are specific feedback points tailored to help you enhance your essay:

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay touches upon the topic but misses two critical aspects required by the prompt:
   - You need to specify which areas of daily life could be reconsidered to reduce traffic. This part of your argument is vague and requires more explicit examples or suggestions.
   - It's also essential to clearly state your stance on the issue, including the extent of your agreement or disagreement with the given statement and the reasons behind your viewpoint.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are several spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout your essay which could disrupt the reader’s understanding. For instance:
   - ""these day"" should be ""these days.""
   - ""interations"" should be ""interactions.""
   - ""gorvernment"" should be ""government.""
   - ""amout"" should be ""amount.""
   - ""puplic"" should be ""public.""
   - ""atmostphere"" should be ""atmosphere.""
   Additionally, consider using transition words to improve the flow between sentences and paragraphs.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is somewhat clear, as you believe improving public transport is a better solution than reducing the need for daily commuting. However, emphasizing the reasons for your stance and explicitly stating your disagreement with the initial solution would make your position stronger and more persuasive.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: While you provide examples and alternatives, such as the success of public transport in Japan, your arguments could be more robust. Aim to:
   - Offer more detailed descriptions and examples to support your viewpoint.
   - Clearly outline the disadvantages of reducing daily commuting, alongside proposing alternatives.
   - Discuss the possible challenges and benefits of the alternatives you suggest, making your argument more balanced and informative.

It also concludes that this result in the overall rising cost of health care in the United States. Several reasons below are presenting the argument provides unsupportive evidence. \n First, it's oversimplification to conclude that the art and music therapy can apply to all illness and diseases. Doctors rarely recommend the therapy because the therapy can only has significant effect in several area. For mental illness, alternative therapy like art and music are helpful to manage stress, promote wellness, enhance memory, improve communication, and give people a way to express feelings. For physical illness, the therapy do help but most of the therapy effect focus on alleviating pain rather than healing physical body damage. For example, it is difficult to stop one's bleeding by asking someone just playing instrument and listening to music. \n Second, the argument ignores the spending of applying art and music therapy might be. Listening to a music and enjoy a painting might be costless, but what if the therapy requires a patient to play instrument to stimulate the damage of nerves and mental disorders? Take a guitar for instance, a good guitar might cost hundreds and thousands of dollars. It is questionable that whether a patient can afford. Furthermore, the rare application of art and music therapy escalates the medical fee of the therapy. Seldom doctors and professional medical institution do a great job at applying this kind of therapy. We should evaluate the medical spending of the therapy before drawing conclusion that using drug treatments and invasive procedures is contributing to the rising cost of health care in the United States. \n Yes, art and music therapy do help several physical illness by producing chemical to make a patient feel good so that alleviate his/her pain. And yes, there is some therapy that costs less, such as write songs, enjoy paintings and music. However, the therapeutic effect might be less, not direct, and takes a long time. How many patients or the family of patients wants to participate the therapy that takes long time and dedication. How many patients can stabilize during the therapy that takes time to heal one's harm. \n Art and music therapy do have therapeutic effects to patients. But it has great limitations when comparing to normal drug usage and invasive procedures. Overall, the argument draw the conclusion that a doctor are doing a disservice to their patients and contributing to the rising cost of health care in the United States is lack of supportive evaluation.","Dear student, in the first paragraph, you should completely mention the assumptions being made in the discussion presentation.

You should also be conscious of your discussion presentations. You are presenting an analysis of the given discussion. That means all the information for consideration has been provided to you. Therefore, your presentation becomes unnecessarily complicated when you present questions in the essay. Rather posing a question, present it as a fact that the writer did not consider while writing the article instead. \n Aside from a few grammar errors and the observations above, you did a good job of presenting an analytical discussion. Further practice essays written in this manner could ensure that you get more than a passing score in the actual test.","The essay attempts to analyze a complex topic regarding the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of art and music therapy compared to traditional medical treatments. However, there are areas for improvement to make the argument stronger and the essay more coherent.

1. **Clarity and Response to the Topic**: The introduction should clearly state the assumptions discussed, including the mention of music therapy as an alternative healing process. This will help readers understand the basis of your argument and how it relates to the topic. Ensure that each paragraph has a clear idea that supports the overall thesis.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentences that could be simplified for clarity. Avoid starting sentences with conjunctions like ""And."" Instead, use them to connect sentences or ideas within the same sentence. This will improve the flow and coherence of your essay. Review your use of singular and plural forms, especially with collective terms such as ""the therapy,"" to ensure consistency and accuracy.

3. **Clear Point of View**: Your essay presents an argument against the assumption that art and music therapies are less effective and more costly than traditional medical treatments. However, this point of view could be made clearer by directly addressing the assumptions made about these therapies and providing a structured argument against them.

4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: The essay makes several claims about the limitations and costs of art and music therapy, yet it often lacks specific examples or data to support these points. When discussing costs, for instance, adding actual comparisons or statistics would strengthen your argument. Avoid posing rhetorical questions within your analysis. Instead, present these considerations as facts or overlooked aspects by the original discussion to reinforce your points.

Improvement Areas:
- Enhance the introduction by explicitly mentioning key discussions points, such as the role of music therapy.
- Link your ideas more effectively; avoid isolated statements or questions that could confuse the reader.
- Focus on providing specific evidence and examples to support your arguments.
- Aim for simpler sentence structures to increase the readability and effectiveness of your essay.

Strengths:
- The essay tackles an interesting and relevant topic, showing the importance of considering various aspects of healthcare treatments.

Although there are some drawbacks of Internet-based learning, I would argue there are far more benefits. \n The main drawback of e-learning in universities is that there is less direct communication. Students enrolled in online courses may not have the opportunity to engage face-to-face with their lecturers and tutors, which makes it more difficult to study. Similarly, students who study online will have less chances to interact directly with their classmates, leading to a negative impact on peer-assisted learning. For instance, whereas students in traditional classes are able to attend seminars or have group meetings, online learners are restricted to chatting through website forum areas, which may affect their motivation in learning. \n Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the development of online study is a positive trend for several reasons. Firstly, Internet-based learning allows people to study in a more flexible way, meaning that they can work whenever and wherever is suitable for them. Secondly, the cost of education can be largely reduced through learning online courses, since virtual classrooms require less equipment than traditional classrooms. Thirdly and lastly, e-learning provides all people access to learn knowledge as long as they have such willingness, regardless of age, country, language and cultural background. For example, my uncle has enrolled in an online IT course is a university in West Australia, which would have been impossible in the days before online study. \n In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online university courses, I consider it to be a positive development overall.","Dear student, your essay response is inappropriate based upon the original prompt. The discussion is clearly requesting you to create a single opinion response by giving you a choice of answers (positive OR negative). Therefore, you should have clearly depicted a clear opinion leaning towards one consideration alone. The prompt never made any room for a comparison essay so you should not have presented that as a response. Aside from that, the essay is only 4 paragraphs long when the Task 2 essay should always be a 5 paragraph response. Additionally, you must never have paragraphs numbering less than 3 -5 sentences long. These are the main reasons that your overall score will be lowered in the final consideration. Let me break this down for you now. \n TA - 4 - your response diverged from the original prompt requirements. The response you delivered was not the required response and as such, could not be given a passing score. The paraphrase is one of the most important elements of the Task 2 essay and when you fail to gain a high score in this section, all the other scores will tend to suffer. There is an imperative need for you to properly assess and respond to the given task. The proper paraphrase response to this should have been similar to: \n <em>Educational institutions these days have the ability to offer online classes for the benefit of their students. This academic advancement has been met by students as either a good or bad occurrence in the academic field. In this essay, I will be discussing the reasons as to why I believe that this is a positive development in the pursuit of academic learning.</em> \n The opening statement is your opportunity to fully impress upon the examiner your ability to not only understand the English language, but also showcase your English vocabulary by writing a paragraph worded so differently from the original, and yet still maintaining the original topic for discussion. That is what I have shown you in the example above. \n C&C - 4 - Don't try to discuss more than one topic per paragraph so that you can fully develop your explanations. You have 3 bodies of paragraph with which to discuss 3 supporting reasons in a clear, coherent, and cohesive manner. There is no need to try and cram all of the information into one paragraph. Take your time, do it one at a time since you have the opportunity to do so. Fully utilize the 3 paragraphs in defense of your position. So the format should be: \n Topic sentence + Reason 1 + Reason 2 (optional) + Example \n -All the reasoning sentences must be in support of the topic sentence. A full 5 sentences will gain you the highest score possible. After the topic sentence, the remaining 3 sentences should discuss the topic and offer a clear example in support of your reasoning at the end. Do this for every reason that you wish to discuss. Use up to 3 topic sentences in a single, dedicated paragraph each. \n LR - 6 - You have shown an ability to use intermediately advanced English words in your essay in a proper manner. That means your sentences are better written due to your ability to use the words you have chosen in the proper context. \n GRA - 6 - Your grammar is understandable and the mistakes in sentence formation do not impede the understanding of your written work. Your essay has just the appropriate mix of simple and complex sentences. \n Now, I scored your essay individually, that means per criteria, regardless of the mistake in the TA section. In the actual test though, the examiner will take note of the mistake and will have to decide on the rest of your scores using more intricate details and considerations. The essay might pass, or it might fail, depending upon the other criteria that will be considered in the end.","Your essay presents a thoughtful discussion on the topic of online courses in university education, presenting both the advantages and disadvantages before arguing that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to better meet the expectations for this type of assignment.

1. **Topic Response**: Your essay partially misses the mark in directly responding to the prompt. The assignment calls for a definitive stance on the topic, either positive or negative, rather than a comparison of both sides. A more focused approach on why you believe online study is a positive development, without the contrast against its disadvantages, would align more closely with the prompt's requirements. This clarity of opinion is crucial for fulfilling task achievement criteria.

2. **Essay Structure**: The essay is structured into four paragraphs, but for this task, a five-paragraph format is more appropriate. This includes an introduction, three body paragraphs each dedicated to a different supporting point, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should ideally be 3-5 sentences long. This not only aids in the clarity and depth of your arguments but also adheres to the expected essay structure.

3. **Arguments and Development**: The essay would benefit from a clearer development of arguments. A recommended format is starting each body paragraph with a topic sentence, followed by one or two reasons supporting this sentence, and concluding with a concrete example. This format ensures your paragraphs are cohesive and focused on a single aspect of your main argument, making your position stronger and more convincing.

4. **Language Use and Grammar**: On a positive note, your use of language and grammar is commendable. You have successfully used a mix of simple and complex sentence structures and demonstrated a good vocabulary. These strengths contribute positively to the readability of your essay and help communicate your ideas more effectively.

5. **Paraphrasing and Introduction**: The introduction of your essay could be strengthened by paraphrasing the prompt more effectively. This does not just demonstrate your language proficiency but also sets the stage for your argument. A revised introduction might emphasize your clear stance on the positivity of online learning advancements without implying a comparison of positives and negatives.

In conclusion, while your essay has many strengths, including a clear perspective and the use of advanced language, focusing on a more definitive response to the prompt, ensuring adherence to the five-paragraph structure, and developing your arguments more clearly would significantly improve your essay.

1. **Addressing the Essay Prompt:** The original essay prompt asks you to discuss the extent of your agreement with the view that developments in IT will likely have more negative effects than positive ones in the future. Your essay explores both sides somewhat equally, rather than focusing on arguing to what extent you agree with the statement. To better meet the essay requirements, you should clearly state your opinion on whether the negative effects outweigh the positive ones and then concentrate on supporting that viewpoint throughout your essay.

2. **Clarity and Argumentation:** Your introduction to AI and automation is clear, and you outline potential benefits and drawbacks. However, to make your arguments more persuasive, you should elaborate more on how and why these technologies could lead to negative outcomes, directly correlating them with the prompt's focus on future impacts. This would strengthen your stance and make your point of view more evident.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are minor issues with grammar and style. For instance, when discussing the negative impacts, try to provide a more varied sentence structure and specific examples to vividly illustrate your points. Also, ensure to maintain a formal tone suitable for an essay, avoiding casual expressions.

4. **Supporting Your Position:** While you mention both positive and negative aspects, the development of your arguments, especially in supporting your viewpoint on the prompt, needs deepening. Use specific examples, statistics, or studies to back up your claims. This evidence will make your essay more convincing and show a thorough understanding of the topic.

Remember, your goal is to demonstrate a comprehensive engagement with the topic, clearly expressing your stance and rigorously supporting it through well-structured arguments and examples.

Consequently, when they watch an advertisement in the television, they can be easily influenced by it. Fast food advertisements are a great example; They are usually accompanied by colorful and lively images of clowns or fantastic creatures. These pictures attract children who cannot understand or do not know the unhealthy effects of junk food. They stimulate their brain and make them crave even more of this food, leading them to the adoption of an unhealthy lifestyle. \n In addition, kids nowadays, even at this young age, are subjected to significant peer pressure. This is the case especially in Western, developed societies. Young children want to have what their peers possess and they feel particularly sad or depressed when their parents are unable to provide a particular toy or service due to financial issues . Advertisements aimed at young children often promote a spirit of consumerism which encourages children to ""not be left behind their peers"". This, can also cause friction between children and their parents, when the latter cannot afford the advertised product. \n To conclude, some people would say that it is not the responsibility of the government to regulate television advertisements but of the parents. However, we should take note that parents are not always able to supervise what their children are watching, mainly due to their many commitments. Therefore, it should be the state, under its responsibility to protect and positively influence the youth, that it should restrict television advertising aimed at young children.","The writer should choose to discuss only one of the two choices provided for the sake of clarity. Which of the 2 options do you believe would best control the problem? Why? Those are the only 2 discussion questions the essay should address. There is an over focus on the influence of advertising on children. The presentation should be balanced at 50/50, showing the wason why the chosen side best protects children from the pitfalls of advertising. \n The essay has a strong tendency to veer off track in terms of discussion. The writer sometimes includes irrelevant discussion points that add to length but not clarity of explanation. The total focus has to be centered on advertising. Peer pressure has nothing to do with government control or banning. \n Here is another tip, use an actual TOEFL essay prompt next time instead of an IELTS prompt. TOEFL prompts have a totally different format and ffocus.","The essay effectively addresses the topic and is generally in line with the prompt's requirements, discussing the impact of television advertising on young children and proposing regulation or banning as a solution. However, to improve clarity and relevance, it is recommended that the essay focus more precisely on one of the proposed solutions, either strict regulation or a total ban. Exploring why one of these options would be more effective in addressing the concerns outlined would provide a clearer and more compelling argument.

There are a few spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, some words are misspelled, such as ""advertisment"" and phrases like ""in my view"" could be strengthened by saying ""I strongly believe"" to convey a more confident stance. Also, maintaining consistency in tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement would enhance the readability of the essay. 

The viewpoint of the author is expressed, but it could be made clearer by directly stating which solution (regulation or banning) is preferred and why. This can help streamline the argument and make it more persuasive to the reader. 

While the essay presents valid concerns regarding the influence of advertising on children, it could benefit from a more balanced discussion. Currently, there's heavy emphasis on the negative impact without equal consideration of how either regulation or banning would effectively address these concerns. Introducing comparisons or statistics could strengthen the argument by providing a concrete basis for the author's position. 

Additionally, the inclusion of peer pressure as a major discussion point seems to divert attention from the main argument. The connection between peer pressure and the need for government intervention in advertising is not clearly established. Refocusing on advertising itself and how it directly influences children would make the argument more cohesive and impactful.

Lastly, choosing a prompt that aligns more directly with the intended format (for example, TOEFL if that's the target) could help in ensuring the essay meets specific criteria expected in those exams. This advice is more about aligning practice with exam expectations than a critique of the current essay's content. 

In summary, the essay would benefit from a clearer focus on one proposed solution, careful proofreading for spelling and grammatical errors, and a more balanced and direct approach to discussing the impact of advertising on children. Simplifying the language and making the argument more straightforward can also enhance the overall effectiveness of the essay.",3,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

It means the minor did bring them more benefits than the major in the past, but drawbacks make it no longer populated. \n On the one hand, there are some advantages which were suitable for the old lifestyle. Firstly, one of the features of living in villages that is still accurate until now is its healthy environment. Pollution has never been a concern because of the fresh air and the peaceful atmosphere. Secondly, people in rural areas had an extremely close relationship. Since there were a few people in a village, everyone knew each other, and solidarity which was highly promoted by the former society was noticeable. Whenever someone had a problem, there were always people who willingly gave a hand. \n On the other hand, some disadvantages created many difficulties in daily life, which is why the low population density in the countryside. Firstly, there is short of equipment and it is usually old-fashioned. This results in underdevelopment that happened in different fields such as IT, education, health, entertainment, and so on. The countryside is isolated from the other parts of the world as the news was not timely updated which is intensely serious since information is needed to prevent a disaster. Moreover, poor conditions led to backward thinking and ignorance of the citizens. This is because they live in a community with traditions instead of adapting cultures like in the big city. \n In short, although living in villages has both pros and cons, drawbacks have created a strong impact on modern life that makes it no longer be an ideal place to live in. Especially, when the pandemic is spreading, health care services playing an important role are mostly supplied in cities.","Your prompt restatement does not make a clear connection with the original prompt. The original discussion simply stated that the discussion is to be based on a a general discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community. The writer is not being asked to perform any assessment of the topics that could lead to a presentation of a personal opinion. Rather than a personal opinion, the last part of the first paragraph should only state one advantage sentence topic and one disadvantage sentence topic. Based on the prompt restatement + response guidelines, the writer failed to properly represent the original prompt. \n The discussion patterns of the writer are acceptable. However, the cohesiveness of the paragraphs need to be better developed to increase the C+C score that is reliant of the proper connection between reason 1 and reason 2 in a paragraph. For example, the focal point of the first reasoning paragraph is pollution. Therefore, the second reason should indicate the relationship of pollution with the small community. This would be a greater disadvantage representation since it will clearly connect the small community discussion to the anchor topic. \n <quotation>Firstly</quotation> \n You cannot use a numerical ordinal in a paragraph if there is no series that follows it. You need not always count or numerically list your reasons. You can just discuss the topics directly and use connecting phrases instead. Build your transition words, phrases, and sentences abilities to further increase your GRA score. \n This is not an opinion essay but a general discussion. Therefore, the writer's personal opinion should not be reflected anywhere in the presentation.Not in the introduction, not in the conclusion. This is a direct prompt alteration that will have negative scoring results for the writer in the end.","The essay explores the topic of the advantages and disadvantages of living in small communities as compared to larger ones. This exploration is crucial, yet the essay slightly misinterprets the original prompt. It mistakenly introduces the topic as a comparison between past and present preferences for community sizes and then presents a conclusion based on personal opinion. For an essay that aims to discuss general advantages and disadvantages, it's important to maintain focus on just that, without leaning towards a personal viewpoint or comparing different time periods unless specifically asked for in the prompt.

Firstly, the structure and development of ideas within the essay have room for improvement to make your arguments more coherent and connected. When introducing reasons, there's no need to numerically list them as ""firstly"" or ""secondly"" unless you have a series of closely related points. Instead, focus on creating smooth transitions between your ideas, relying on logical connections and relevant linking phrases. This will not only help the flow of your essay but also enhance its overall clarity and readability.

Regarding the content, while the essay successfully identifies several advantages and disadvantages of living in small communities, there is a missed opportunity to clearly connect the ideas within paragraphs. For instance, if discussing the fresh air in villages as an advantage, directly relate it to another aspect of small community living to reinforce your argument and maintain relevance to the topic. This approach ensures a tighter narrative and underscores the importance of each point you are making.

Moreover, there is an observable deviation from the task by incorporating personal opinion, particularly towards the end of the essay. Remember, the goal is to present a balanced general discussion based on the assignment's requirements. Introducing personal viewpoints or concluding on personal preferences shifts the focus away from the objective analysis expected in this type of essay.

On the linguistic front, the essay demonstrates a commendable effort in using English for complex expressions. However, there are instances of grammatical inconsistencies and awkward phrasings. Paying closer attention to sentence structure, subject-verb agreement, and the appropriate use of articles will significantly enhance the essay's quality. Additionally, refining your use of vocabulary to more accurately capture your thoughts can elevate the sophistication of your writing.

In summary, your essay has the foundational elements of a strong discussion. To improve, aim for greater adherence to the prompt by avoiding personal opinions, enhance the cohesiveness between your points, refine your language use, and focus on creating logical transitions between ideas. These adjustments will not only align your essay closer to the task but also make your arguments more compelling and easier to follow.",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

To what extent do you agree ?,"Science and technology are advancing rapidly with novel innovations created everyday. It is commonly believed that those breakthroughs should take human life satisfaction as their principles. I partially agree with the above-mentioned notion, reasons are to follow. \n On the one hand, science immensely influences citizen's living standards. First and foremost, it is apparent that laboratory experiments play a pivotal role in the medical industry, hence enhancing the overall strength of individuals. Medicines, antidotes, vaccines,...etc are the most noticeable outcomes of this statement. Moreover, scientific breakthroughs enable some occupations to become more straightforward. In other words, life has been functioning clockwise with those revolutions. For instance, commuting was made trivial due to the invention of wheels and energy sources. \n On the other hand, however, the benefits of other creatures are not the aspect to be overlooked. Admittedly, the greenhouse effect is attributed to technological advancements in which profits inhabitants's life satisfaction. Therefore, it is mandatory for such breakthroughs to tackle the conundrums, thus reversing the planet contamination. Not only should environments be considered, ensuring biodiversity is one paramount importance as well. Putting it in another way, there is a demand for solutions to protect the endangered animals and probably in the far-fetched future to resurrect some extinct creatures. \n In conclusion, with the fore-mentioned notions, I believe that science's goals should be equally distributed equally amongst the profits of human beings and other species.

That is because the minimum count is 250. Fail to write 250 words and your essay will receive equivalent percentage deductions based on the missing words. It is impossible to recover from that sort of deduction as it leaves you with an almost 0 scoring consideration for the preliminaries. You should have also used a more appropriate comparison reasoning paragraph in the body of the essay. You should have explained the points that you do not agree with in the paragraph, then followed up, in the same paragraph, with the points that you agree with. In that case, you would have been scored on your use of transitional phrases or sentences.","The essay presents an engaging discussion on the role of science and technology in human life satisfaction, touching upon the important consideration of its impact on other species and the environment. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the essay.

Firstly, it is noted that the essay's word count falls below the expected minimum of 250 words, totaling only 212. This shortfall could significantly impact the overall score, as essays under the minimum length often face substantial deductions. To address this, it might be beneficial to expand on the ideas already presented or introduce new points. For instance, providing more detailed examples of how science and technology have benefited both humans and the environment could enrich the argument and increase the word count.

In terms of structure, the essay would benefit from clearer comparison and contrast within its argumentative paragraphs. When discussing the advantages and disadvantages or agreements and disagreements with the notion that technological advancements should prioritize human life satisfaction, a more structured approach could improve clarity. It's recommended to first present the points of disagreement, followed by points of agreement within the same paragraph, using transitional phrases to smoothly connect these ideas. This method not only clarifies your position but also demonstrates effective use of language skills.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and style, there are minor issues that could be improved. For instance, ""citizen's"" should be ""citizens'"" to correctly indicate possession for the plural noun, and ""inhabitants's"" should be corrected to ""inhabitants'"" for the same reason. Additionally, the use of more varied sentence structures and active voice could enhance readability and engagement.

The point of view of the author is relatively clear, focusing on a balanced perspective that values both human and environmental considerations. However, making this viewpoint more explicit in the introduction and conclusion could strengthen the overall effectiveness of the essay.

Finally, while the essay mentions the importance of innovations benefiting all living creatures, providing clear, descriptive arguments with specific examples would better support this position. Detailing how certain technologies have achieved or could achieve this balance would make the argument more persuasive and concrete.

In summary, to improve this essay, focus on increasing the word count by elaborating on existing points or incorporating new ones, structuring the body paragraphs to clearly present contrasting viewpoints with transitional phrases, addressing minor grammatical errors, and providing more specific examples to support the thesis. These steps would not only address the current shortcomings but also enhance the overall coherence and persuasiveness of the essay.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

As the description above, it said punishment is essential to help children learn the contrast between right and wrong. \n I agree with this opinion. People should punish kids when necessary. There are three reasons to support this view. First, children might make mistakes next time without punishment. The reason to impose a punishment is to warn the children not just to punish. If adults don't punish them, the children won't learn a lesson from this experience. Second,with my experience that I suspected in junior high schools. If students don't get any punishment,they will interrupt others in the class. It will unable teachers to teach other students. Third,sometimes children don't own correct perspectives, therefore, punishment is set to get rid of their wrong behavior or thoughts. \n From my perspective, the physical punishment is not allowed to give to children,because it will hurt their body and mental state. With my experience, parents and teachers need to let children understand the exact reason why they are banished.

That will also translate into the final score for your essay because of the inadequacies of your presentation. Your first problem, is that you did not properly paraphrase the prompt. The first paragraph always requires the test take to prove his English comprehension and writing skills by properly restating the topic for discussion, type of discussion, and transition sentence at the end of it. It is always assumed that the examiner will not have access to the question you were given to discuss so you will need to present your own understanding of those required elements prior to your full discussion in the body paragraphs. \n Your discussion will score a 3 in terms of cohesiveness and coherence as well. That is based upon the fact that you did not properly develop your reasoning process per paragraph. In this instance, one discussion your opinion required one paragraph. One discussion, in a separate paragraph of your personal experience was also required. By discussing the ideas in the same paragraph, you did not properly transition the discussion so you ended up creating a confusing paragraph instead. It was confusing because your explanations lacked relevance and did not relate to each other. That is why individual paragraphs need to be assigned in this instance. \n The biggest problem of your essay at this point relate to the opening statement and conclusion. I already explained the problem of the opening statement to you. The problem with your conclusion, simply put, is that you do not have one. There is no proper summation of the discussion at the end which would have required a recapitulation of the previous discussion, personal experience, and grounding method.

However, there are areas that could be improved to make your essay more effective and aligned with English proficiency test standards.

1. **Topic Response:** Your introduction does not fully paraphrase the prompt. It's important to show your understanding of the topic by restating the question and your stance in your own words. This helps the reader understand the context of your essay without seeing the original prompt.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay contains grammatical errors and style issues that could be improved for clarity. For example, phrases like ""suspected in junior high schools"" are confusing; perhaps you meant ""observed in junior high schools."" Pay attention to punctuation as well; spaces are needed after commas and periods. Also, try to avoid run-on sentences by breaking long sentences into shorter, more concise ones.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your point of view is clear; you support punishment for children to learn right from wrong but oppose physical punishment. This is a strong stance. Yet, clarifying and expanding on why you believe this could make your argument stronger. Including more about the negative effects of physical punishment might support your position effectively.

4. **Arguments and Support:** Your arguments are broadly outlined but lack depth. It would be beneficial to develop each reason into its paragraph with specific examples or personal experiences that support your view. This structure aids in making your essay cohesive and coherent. For instance, sharing a personal observation or a study about the effects of non-physical punishment could make your argument more persuasive.

5. **Cohesion and Coherence:** The essay tends to discuss multiple ideas in a single paragraph. It's more effective to dedicate one paragraph to each argument. This allows you to develop each idea fully and link them together more smoothly. Transition sentences at the end of paragraphs can help guide the reader from one point to the next without confusion.

6. **Conclusion:** Your essay needs a proper conclusion that summarizes your arguments and restates your position. This is not only a chance to recap what you've discussed but also to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

This is a crucial topic and here the bond between two people(as friends or enemies) will be discussed. \n What causes two people to become allies? Is it time or opportunity? Is it the high status, wealth and authority that one can give to someone close to them? Of course not, when we talk about the bond of friendship we say that there is an understanding and good chemistry. One can feel the joy or suffering that the other person is going through. \n In the series of Harry Potter, it clearly tells us that Harry trusts his two friends, Ron and Hermione and depends on them.

They were comfortable around each other and were always there for each other. \n In the contrary, the quote,""It is neither time nor opportunity that is to determine intimacy. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others,"" holds true meaning to the reality that is expressed between the acquaintance of two people.","You won't be happy with the score that this essay might get.

This essay calls for a personal analysis of the passage and the professors normally appreciate it when students relate the passage to their personal involvement in similar situations.","This essay presents an interesting view on the nature of friendship and intimacy, focusing on understanding, chemistry, and mutual support. However, there are several areas where improvements are necessary to better align the essay with the expected response to the topic, enhance clarity, and correct any errors.

1. **Relevance to the Topic:** The essay does not directly address the given prompt, which requires an analysis based on the novel ""Sense and Sensibility"" by Jane Austen. Instead, it references the ""Harry Potter"" series. To improve, refocus the essay to analyze friendships or adversarial relationships within ""Sense and Sensibility,"" using specific examples from the novel to discuss how time or opportunity influences these relationships. This approach will ensure your essay is relevant and adheres to the requirements.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** While there are minor issues with punctuation (e.g., missing commas) and some word choices could be improved for clarity, the overall readability of the essay is good. However, focusing on clearer sentence structures and carefully proofreading to catch any grammatical errors can enhance your essay. Additionally, using transition phrases can help in making your essay flow better from one idea to the next.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** Your position on the significance of understanding, chemistry, and mutual support in forming intimate relationships is clear. Nevertheless, grounding this viewpoint within the specified context (the novel) and supporting it with concrete examples would strengthen your argument and clarify your stance further.

4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay lacks direct references to ""Sense and Sensibility"" and instead uses an unrelated text as evidence. To strengthen your position, include specific examples and passages from ""Sense and Sensibility"" that illustrate your points about the role of time or opportunity in developing intimacy. Consider how certain relationships in the novel either support or refute the initial quote. Moreover, relating the discussion to personal experience can add a valuable dimension to your analysis, making your argument more compelling.

Firstly, the lack of clear personal opinions throughout the essay makes it difficult to fully grasp the author's stance until the conclusion. While the conclusion suggests a personal belief in the value of AI, offering personal insights or interpretations alongside the discussion of each viewpoint would strengthen the essay. To improve, integrate personal opinions when discussing both the benefits and drawbacks of AI. This approach would offer a more nuanced and engaging analysis.

Thirdly, while the essay does provide arguments supporting both the positive and negative impacts of AI, these arguments could be enhanced by being more specific and descriptive. For example, when mentioning AI's role in surgery and exploration, adding more details about the technology and its potential future developments would provide a richer context. Likewise, when discussing the threats AI poses, including specific examples or statistics would make your arguments more compelling.

Lastly, the older you get, the harder you find in going to university. \n On the other hand, this decision has some undeniable advantages. Working is a good chance to gain various valuable experiences that can't find in school. If you have the acumen and the ability to acquire knowledge dramatically, you can have the promotion opprtunities without a degree. The obtaining of real experiences also useful for you in studying when you intend to go to the university thus this process forces you in a discipline that significantly help you easy accustomed to the studying environment. \n In conclusion, it seems evident that youngsters have to aware of these issues and have their own adjust to suitable for the situation. In my opinion, they should start working between school and university despite the notable drawbacks.","This is not an opinion essay. As such, your opinion at the end of the summary statement was not required. In fact, your summary statement is not a complete rendition of the original prompt restatement. An example complete restatement is: \n <em>Ideas have emerged that high school graduates should consider gaining full employment in the form of gap years. While this idea is a sound proposal, it appears that youngsters who work prior to attending college may experience both benefits and drawbacks. That is why it is important that both sides of this discussion be assessed.</em> \n In the above example, the examiner can see the restated: \n - Topic sentence (high school graduates should consider gaining full employment in the form of gap years) \n - Reason (benefits and drawbacks) \n - Discussion instruction ( both sides of this discussion be assessed) \n 3 sentences, one complete paragraph, a thorough paraphrasing of the original discussion. That is how the discussion should always be presented in a task 2 essay. \n I have to be honest though and say that there is a lack of clarity in the discussion paragraphs. Your thought process does not follow a logical line of reasoning and the grammar structure makes the passages difficult to understand. It takes several repeated readings of your work before a guess of what you are trying to say can be achieved. You need to practice more with regards to English sentence structures to make sure that you learn to create understandable sentences. \n Since the conclusion is only a summary of the discussion based on your given paragraph bodies, it will appear that this is not properly represented either. You are again, under the word count, not properly summarizing your content, and giving an opinion where none is required. I am sad to say that this is not the type of essay that can achieve a 5 band score. \n Keep practicing though. That is the only way you can get better at this. Work more on your English comprehension skills and grammar exercises. Those are your two weakest points in this essay.","Your essay discusses whether students should pursue jobs before furthering their education at a university, highlighting both benefits and drawbacks. This is a good start. However, to further improve your essay, consider the following feedback:

1. **Response to the Topic:** Your introduction hints at the topic, but it lacks a clear restatement of the issue and the necessity to assess both sides comprehensively. Aim to present the topic clearly in the introduction by stating what you will discuss and why it's important. For example, you could begin with a sentence like, ""The idea of high school graduates taking gap years for full employment has its merits and demerits, which warrants a balanced examination.""

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay has some spelling mistakes (e.g., ""opprtunities"" should be ""opportunities"" and ""continuos"" should be ""continuous"") and grammatical inaccuracies. Your sentences sometimes are difficult to follow due to these issues. For example, ""studying need a continuos of practicing"" could be clearer and more grammatically correct if written as ""studying requires continuous practice."" To improve, focus on practicing English sentence structures and consider breaking complex ideas into simpler sentences to enhance clarity.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your position comes through in places, particularly in the conclusion. However, your essay sometimes strays from a clear line of reasoning, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument. To address this, make sure each paragraph has a clear main idea and supportive evidence or examples. This will also help in better aligning your conclusion with the body of your essay, summarizing the key points rather than introducing new opinions.

4. **Arguments and Support:** You have outlined both advantages and disadvantages of the topic, which is a good approach. However, your arguments could be more powerful with specific examples or evidence. For example, when discussing the benefits of working before university, providing real-life examples of how practical experience can complement academic studies would make your case stronger. 

Your conclusion suggests a personal opinion, which would be more appropriate in an opinion essay. For essays like this, focus on summarizing the arguments presented rather than concluding with a personal stance unless specifically prompted.

You have a good foundation here. With more practice focusing on essay structure, grammar, and clarity of argument, your writing will undoubtedly improve. Keep working on these areas, and consider seeking feedback regularly to guide your progress.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

Some people opine that, in order to cope with the traffic congestion, people should move from the countryside to city areas. However, I disagree with this view to a large extent, and my reasons will explain in this essay. \n In the first place, Shifting tens of thousands of people to the city side may result in several other additional problems due to the lack of infrastructural facilities. Prevailing facilities and resources in the urban areas will probably not enough to deal with the increasing demand of the community. For instance, public transportation, market and community places will be overwhelmed with the high crowd; therefore, moving people from outskirts to towns will arise numerous social problems and community conflicts. \n Apart from that, the population movement to the city side will increase the urban population, which will magnify the risk of environmental pollution. In order to deal with the increasing demand for the residences and other facilities, authorities will have to gear up the development activities. Increasing construction and development tasks will result in numerous biohazards such as drainage network blockages and the excessive amount of garbage production; hence, encouraging people to move into the city areas will make an adverse impact on the environment and inherently affect the public health. \n In conclusion, rising traffic congestion is a serious matter for many large cities. It has been suggested that an effective solution would be to encourage people to shift from outskirts and suburbs to the city side. From my point of view, population movement is not a feasible way to cope with the transportation issues as it can arise several other social and environmental problems.","there is an improvement in your presentation. I can see that you now understand how to approach an ""extent"" opinion essay. However, you have several grammar errors in this presentation that shows a lack of grammar and sentence development in your essay. You will be scored down for the improper grammar presentation of your sentences. The first way to avoid this problem is to avoid using run on sentences separated either by commas or semicolons. Instead, aim to write short and separate sentences in the paragraph. Writing no more than 5 sentences at the most will maximize your GRA scoring opportunities. The second problem, relating to your sentence structure and use of connecting words, can be resolved by having you pass these practice tests through an online grammar checker before you submit it for review. The grammar checker will help you spot the mistakes and offer corrections that you should remember for your upcoming practice tests. This procedure should help you improve your written sentence formation prior to the actual test. However, since you will not have the grammar checker with you on the actual test date, you should make sure to remember your points for correction during practice so that you don't make the same mistakes during the actual test. \n Additionally, you must also write a total of 5 paragraphs in your Task 2 presentation in order to fully utilize your scoring considerations in all 4 criteria. It will also give you an opportunity to better indicate your English comprehension and writing skills because you will be expressing more of yourself in English. Remember, it not about writing more words though, but explaining more about your understanding of the essay prompt in simple terms. Even if you write more words, but you do not properly develop your topic discussion, then it will be useless. Do not write more than 250 words so that you will have time to edit your work before submission.","Your essay provides a thoughtful response to the topic, demonstrating your understanding of an ""extent"" opinion essay format, which is a strong point. However, to further improve your essay and your score in English proficiency tests, certain areas require attention.

Firstly, addressing grammar and sentence structure is essential. The essay contains several grammar errors, impacting its overall clarity and professionalism. To enhance grammar and sentence development, consider writing shorter sentences. This strategy not only avoids run-on sentences but also makes your argument clearer and more direct. Aim for paragraphs with no more than five sentences to improve readability and coherence. Utilizing online grammar checkers can be a beneficial practice to identify and correct mistakes before submitting your work. Although such tools won't be available during the actual test, regularly using them in practice can help you internalize correct grammar usage and sentence structure.

Additionally, the essay lacks the recommended five-paragraph structure, which could limit your scoring potential across the four criteria evaluated in proficiency tests. Expanding your essay to include five paragraphs allows you to express your ideas more fully and demonstrate a broader range of English language skills. This structure typically includes an introduction, three body paragraphs each presenting a unique argument or perspective, and a conclusion. It's crucial to focus on quality rather than quantity; aim to clearly and concisely develop your discussions, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningfully to your overall argument.

Regarding content, your essay effectively communicates your viewpoint and provides relevant arguments supporting your stance against the movement of people from the countryside to city areas as a solution to traffic congestion. However, further strengthening your arguments with specific examples and clearer, more detailed explanations could enhance the persuasiveness and depth of your essay. Also, ensuring that each argument directly supports your thesis will increase the essay's coherence.

In conclusion, by refining the essay's grammar and sentence structure, adhering to the five-paragraph format, and deepening your arguments, you can significantly improve your essay's effectiveness and your overall test score. These adjustments will not only demonstrate your language proficiency but also your ability to formulate and express complex ideas clearly and logically.",3,3,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

I think it is due to the fact that some think doing the same job for life lacks challenges, and others think they cannot adapt the working environment. \n When it comes to the former, people who think keep doing the same job is lacking of challenges usually want to enhance their ability and accumulate experience through changing a variety of works, especially the young adults. For instance, some people change jobs in a few months or years till they think they are experienced enough. \n As for the latter, people who cannot adapt their working environment change jobs rapidly as well. For example, ""tour guide"" is a very exhausting work, you have to sleep really late and wake up very early, in addition, walking for a long distance for touring is also tiring. Many people who work as tour guide, security guard, or porter change their carreers frequently in that it is too exhausting to do it for good. \n In conclusion, I consider the perspective of accumulating the experience through changing jobs a good idea, however, you must ensure that spending those times is worth it. On the other hand, I mostly support people change jobs which make them worn-out, doing that kinds of jobs perpetually may be too exhausting for most people.

If you review the prompt requirement, your opinion is not required in the essay so it shouldn't be mentioned anywhere in it. However, a reference to the fact that you will be discussing several reasons for this occurence and how it can be prevented from happening in the future should be mentioned in the opening statement. Think of the introduction as a teaser. Don't give away the whole the story at the start. Use highlights to accentuate your discussions. The discussion paragraphs need further thought development as the presentations are to shallow in nature when it comes to indicating reasons as to why people switch jobs often. It doesn't present an alternative, as required that can prevent the situation from happening in the future. The concluding paragraph continues to present new ideas for discussion, along with an unwarranted personal opinion. That means it cannot be considered a concluding paragraph. A proper conclusion works only on summarizing a discussion for more accurate consideration of the discussion presented on the part of the writer and reader.","This essay engages with the topic of why people frequently change jobs by discussing two main reasons: the search for new challenges and the need to escape unsuitable working environments. While these points offer a good starting point, the essay could benefit from further development in several areas.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay begins by clearly stating the issue at hand, which is good. However, it appears to stray into the author’s personal opinion rather early. For an essay prompt that does not specifically ask for your personal view, it is crucial to focus on discussing the issue more broadly first before subtly integrating your perspective if needed. Remember, the introduction serves as a roadmap for your essay, hinting at what will be discussed without revealing everything immediately.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:
   - There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that hinder the clarity of your message. For instance, ""people who think keep doing the same job is lacking of challenges"" could be better expressed as ""people who think continuing in the same job lacks challenges.""
   - There are some issues with word choice, such as ""carreers"" instead of ""careers."" Paying attention to spelling will enhance the professionalism of your essay.
   - The style could be made more formal by avoiding contractions and more effectively varying sentence structures to keep the reader engaged.

3. **Clarity of Point of View**:
   - Your point of view becomes clear towards the conclusion, where you express support for job change. However, this opinion is presented somewhat abruptly without being fully developed throughout the essay. It's important to weave your perspective consistently and clearly through the essay rather than save it all for the conclusion.

4. **Support for Arguments**:
   - The arguments provided, particularly with the examples of young adults seeking challenges and individuals in tiring jobs like tour guides, do start to build a case. However, these arguments need to be expanded. Discussing broader implications, adding more examples, or citing studies could strengthen these points.
   - The essay lacks alternative solutions or discussions on how to address the issue of frequent job changes. Exploring potential solutions or preventive measures would make the essay more comprehensive and respond better to the essay prompt.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Lastly, the conclusion introduces new ideas rather than summarizing the discussion. A strong conclusion should reiterate the key points made in the essay and reflect on their importance without bringing in new information.

To improve, focus on elaborating your arguments more thoroughly, adhering closer to the prompt’s requirements, and refining your grammar and style. This will make your essay stronger and more compelling.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative

It disputes the previous finding which revealed that bird fly 112 km/h, which made them faster than a bat. However, the research carried out by McCracken's team believed that they have discovered outcome which people had not heard of. They also argue that their measurement is precise, using the speed device which is usually used for the airplane. It is clear that this result invites many disagreements from other analysists who criticized that there was something wrong on estimating process of speed. The first scholar who has a different tendency is Prof. Graham Taylor, he remarked that this is untrusted information which none should know. However, some analysts regard that bat could fly under 160 km/h because it was helped by gravitation force, impacting to increasing their flying speed. He added that this is very possible because the research object was Brazilian bat which well-known by its ability to travel far away almost 50 km. \n Source: newscientist","Dear student, your article summary should have been presented in three parts, just as the original article was presented.This is because the article discussion was divided into three parts covering the event that happened which is being reported, the assumptions as to how the bats gained so much speed, and then finally, the realization that the scientists had no idea as to why the bats flew that fast. That said, your summary does try to present most of the information in the article. Although, the presentation doesn't really leave the reader as informed as he could be due to way that you seemed to rush through the summary. When writing a summary based on an article that has sub topics in the discussion, make sure that you cover all of the important data presented in the sub topics as well. At this point, this essay informs the reader, but does not clarify the points that he will find himself asking towards the end of your summary report.","Your essay about the Brazilian bat's speed presents some intriguing information. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, accuracy, and the overall quality of your writing. 

1. **Response to the Topic**
Your essay attempts to address the topic by discussing the speed of the Brazilian bat and comparing it to birds. However, it seems to miss a structured approach that clearly divides the essay into identifiable parts, which would help in systematically addressing the topic. To improve, consider organizing your essay into three distinct sections - the discovery of the bat's speed, the theories behind this speed, and the scientific community's response or lack of explanation for this phenomenon. This structure would make your essay more coherent and easier to follow.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**
There are several grammar and stylistic issues in your essay. For example, sentences like ""It disputes the previous finding which revealed that bird fly 112 km/h,"" could be more clearly written as ""It disputes the previous findings that birds can fly at speeds of up to 112 km/h."" Pay attention to verb tense consistency and proper subject-verb agreement. Additionally, using transitions between your arguments can help your essay flow more naturally.

3. **Point of View Clarity**
Your point of view, which seems to be aimed at sharing new scientific findings, is somewhat clear but gets overshadowed by the way the information is presented. It's important to state your main argument or point of view at the beginning and then support it with evidence or further explanations as you proceed.

4. **Descriptive Arguments**
Your essay mentions various arguments and counterarguments regarding the bat's speed, such as the use of specific measuring devices and the influence of gravitational force. These points are good but require more detail and clarity to effectively support your position. For instance, mentioning how the gravitational force specifically impacts the bat's speed or providing more detail about why some analysts doubt the measurement methods would strengthen your argument.

To improve your essay, try to incorporate more detailed explanations, ensure your grammar and spelling are correct, and clearly structure your essay to cover all parts of the topic. Aim for a clear introduction of your topic, followed by detailed body paragraphs that explore each aspect, and conclude with a summary of your findings or thoughts.

As far as I am concerned, this has both positive and negative consequences for humans and the nearby ecosystem. \n Traveling remote regions is associated with a few benefits. To begin with, traveling to other locations allows one to see strange natural wonders of the earth and learn many new things. For instance, visitors may see the wonder of nature, which are awe-inspiring in their splendor. Moreover, tourists that are able to travel to remote locations can experience living in a variety of settings. In addition, biologists can travel to remote regions to explore the habitats of native creatures such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, which may provide them with evidence and experience. Therefore, they will also have a deep understanding of the distinctive species to make many biological breakthroughs. \n However, traveling to a remote area has a number of drawbacks. Tourism has the ability to lift people out of poverty while also ruining their identity. For example, the coral reefs around the Mexican island of Cozumel have been damaged by ships and drivers, and they are still seriously impacted by pollution from large ships. Besides that, a rise in the number of visitors is often followed by an increase in garbage, which has a variety of effects on the area. As a result, the pollution of the surrounding environment system has to be suffered by the locals. \n To summarize, as previously said, going to faraway natural habitats nowadays might be good for scientific study, but it can also have negative implications that endanger people's lives.","<quotation>this has both positive and negative consequences</quotation> \n Good response for a comparative essay.

There are those that require a single opinion such as this one. There are 2 reasons that the essay fails to deliver: \n - It does not follow the response format \n - It does not respond to the question \n The minor failing reason is the lack of opinion clarity due to the misunderstanding of the question. The writer tried to defend both sides, resulting in a discussion question alteration and a failure to properly follow instructions in English.","The essay provided offers a balanced view on the implications of traveling to remote regions, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. However, it's essential to closely align the essay with the exact requirements of the prompt.

**Response to Topic:** 
The essay attempts to examine both sides of the argument, which, while thoughtful, does not directly adhere to the task of deciding if one aspect outweighs the other. It's crucial to develop a singular viewpoint in response to the specific question posed. Deciding whether the positive or negative consequences are more significant and focusing the essay around this decision will make the argument more coherent and directly responsive to the prompt.

**Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** 
The essay is well-written with minimal spelling and grammatical errors. However, there are some instances of awkward phrasing (""ships and drivers"") that could be clarified. Always strive for clear and precise language to ensure your meaning is easily understood. Also, paying attention to punctuation, like using commas appropriately, will improve the readability of your essay.

**Clarity of Point of View:** 
The essay lacks a definitive standpoint which hinders the clarity of the author's perspective. It's important to clearly articulate your view and support it throughout the essay, especially when the prompt asks for a weighed argument. A more focused thesis statement at the beginning would help solidify your stance and guide the essay's direction.

**Arguments and Supporting Details:** 
While the essay presents examples to support both benefits and drawbacks of remote traveling, it needs to concentrate on supporting the chosen stance with more depth. If the task is to argue that one side outweighs the other, providing detailed examples and explanations for why this is the case will strengthen your argument. Consider using more specific examples and elaborate on how these examples support your main argument.

In summary, to improve, it's crucial to:
1. Understand and respond directly to the prompt, choosing a side if required.
2. Use clear and precise language to avoid ambiguity.
3. Declare your viewpoint unmistakably and support it consistently throughout the essay.
4. Ensure your examples and arguments are directly relevant to your stated viewpoint.

That will affect your TA score in terms of prompt restatement accuracy. Your failure to respond directly to the prompt questions created a different discussion slant in the presentation.

1. **Topic Response:** It appears the essay has deviated from directly answering a given question. If the original task provided specific questions, it is crucial to directly address these within your essay. Rather than making broad statements, aim to tailor your essay to answer the posed questions explicitly. This targeted approach will ensure that your writing is relevant and meets the expectations set by the essay prompt.

2. **Word Choice and Accuracy:** The use of terms like ""ancient times"" to describe the recent past (20th century) is not appropriate. It's important to choose words that accurately reflect the time periods or concepts being discussed. Misuse of terms can lead to confusion and detracts from the credibility of your arguments. Aim for precision in language to improve the clarity and appropriateness of your essay.

3. **Essay Structure:** The organization of your essay requires attention. The impact of modern youth's behaviors on relationships with older generations, a critical discussion point, was introduced too late in the essay and not integrated into the overall structure effectively. A well-structured essay typically ends with a summary or conclusion that encapsulates the main points discussed. Incorporating a concluding paragraph that summarizes the key arguments and reflections would enhance the coherence and flow of your essay.

4. **Grammar and Spelling:** While not extensively covered in the feedback, always be vigilant about spelling, grammatical, and stylistic issues. These can distract readers and detract from the strength of your arguments.

5. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** Your essay mentions several examples of technological advancements and their benefits, which is good. However, making your point of view more explicit and directly linking your arguments to the essay question will strengthen your position. When presenting an argument or viewpoint, ensure it is backed by clear, relevant examples or reasoning.

6. **Respect for Past Generations:** You've touched upon an essential topic - the relationship between younger and older generations. This point could be expanded to illustrate more clearly how acknowledging the contributions of older generations could enrich the perspective of the youth. Emphasizing the value of intergenerational respect and learning could make your argument more persuasive and nuanced.

Your writing style is quite descriptive and emotional, which can be effective in captivating your audience. However, these qualities are most impactful when your reasoning and examples are easily digestible by the average reader. Consider simplifying your language and examples to ensure your message is accessible to all, not just those with a specialist interest in the topic.

On a technical note, your essay shows a need for better punctuation, particularly regarding comma usage to indicate pauses where necessary. This will greatly improve the readability of your sentences. Additionally, aiming for paragraphs that are more than just two sentences long will help you develop your arguments more thoroughly. Academic or formal essays typically require at least five sentences per paragraph to build a cohesive argument.

The essay also suffers from a lack of connecting words such as ""a"" and ""the"" in several places, impacting the smoothness of the readers' experience. Incorporating these small but crucial words can significantly improve how your essay reads and is understood.

In terms of structure, while your essay presents a captivating viewpoint on truth, the argumentation would benefit from clearer and more descriptive support for your position. Providing more concrete examples and explaining them in depth would strengthen your argument and help your readers follow your line of reasoning more easily.

It’s commendable that you're engaging with such profound topics. With more practice and attention to the feedback provided, your writing can become more effective in communicating your ideas. Keep working on simplifying your language for the average reader while ensuring the coherence and completeness of your arguments. Your effort is clear, and with continued practice and refinement, your writing will undoubtedly improve.",3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,Argumentative
4493,https://essayforum.com/writing/give-opinion-punishing-young-children-propose-92643/,test,Give your opinion on punishing young children. Propose alternatives.,"It is unquestionably essential that children be capable of distinguishing between rights and wrongs. It does not mean that they should get disciplined to figure out these dissimilarities. I firmly believe that punishing young children is unjust. Instead of such cruel practices, parents and guardians should employ a more restrained approach. \n On the one hand, it is now widely acknowledged that violent penalties against children have particularly negative impacts. First and foremost, they may be subject to physical and psychological injuries. In addition, studies have also proven an increased tendency of misbehavior in said juveniles. One of the suggested reasons is that when young children are exposed to violence early in their lives, they start to mimic such doings as a defense mechanism. On the other hand, other types of verbal punishment - such as scolding - may induce mental distress and confusion in young toddlers. When parents or guardians lash out at the young child, they will naturally become frightened. Their agitation may cause them to close off interactions, as they try to shield themselves from reprimand. Unfortunately, this act of self-preservation may spawn undesirable effects on children's psychological development. Recent research has pointed out that children who suffer from verbal abuse are especially prone to becoming emotionally and psychologically stunted. Hence, I reckon that it is time parents tried other non-violating and more temperate methods of discipline. I propose that children be left to discover the consequences of their actions alone - though with proper caution. Besides, sending them to do extra chores or complete additional assignments may be one alternative to punishing a child - without making them experience discomfort. On another note, parents can train their offspring to be upright individuals by setting examples themselves. I suppose that this is arguably the best way of bringing up a toddler. \n It is of utmost importance that youngsters get nurtured and tutored properly - with loving words and caring actions. No children should have to suffer because of the minor mistakes they inevitably make. I insist that guardians of young adolescents refrain from imposing harsh punishment and make an effort to employ milder substitutes.","Avoid exaggerations in your restatement presentations as words such as ""unquestionable"" will alter the original intent of the presentation. Being a general reference in the original, the same sentiment should be presented in the restatement. The additional word, as an exaggeration appears to be the writer's personal opinion, which should not be included in the prompt restatement. The extent response and personal response basis are very well developed. However, there should have been a clear reference to what 2 restrained discipline approaches you plan to discuss in the essay. One clearly referring to parental alternative discipline and the other, related to teacher implemented regulations for students. That way a full pre-discussion summary is completed in accordance with task requirements. \n The reasoning paragraphs do not follow the prescribed 3 paragraph format. These should separately represent: \n - The opinion of the writer \n - Suggested parental discipline \n - Suggested teacher conduct control action \n The writers does not fully thresh out the discussion based on the required format for the discussion. There needs to be a differentiation between educator and parental discipline. They cannot be expected to use the same methods since they are related to the child in different ways. One is personal, the other is educational. So the alternative discipline method should represent that difference. \n While the exam taker showed an understanding of the prompt, the discussion method is incorrect and does not represent the correct discussion considerations. While the essay will receive scores in all aspects, I am not sure if these will be enough to pass the test.","The essay addresses the important topic of how children should be disciplined without resorting to harsh punishment. The clarity and expression of your point of view are strong points of this essay. You effectively argue against physical and verbal punishments due to their potentially harmful effects on children's physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. You also suggest alternative discipline methods, such as letting children face the consequences of their actions and using chores or extra assignments as forms of discipline. 

However, there are several areas for improvement to make your essay more aligned with the expected structure and content for English proficiency tests:

1. **Avoid Exaggerations**: The use of words like ""unquestionably"" in the introduction makes your statement seem more like a personal opinion rather than a balanced argument. It's essential to present your points in a way that doesn't exaggerate or overly assert your personal views, especially when restating the essay topic.

2. **Clarity in Discipline Alternatives**: While you mention alternatives to harsh punishment, it would be beneficial to clearly outline the two main types of discipline you propose – one that can be applied by parents and another suitable for teachers. This distinction is vital as the approach to discipline might differ significantly between home and educational environments. By introducing these alternatives early on, your essay would follow a more structured and coherent flow.

3. **Essay Structure**: Following the suggested structure more closely would enhance your essay's clarity and effectiveness. Dividing your argument into three separate paragraphs—one presenting your viewpoint, another discussing alternative discipline methods by parents, and a third focusing on how teachers could implement discipline—could provide a clearer and more comprehensive discussion on the matter.

4. **Differentiation Between Parental and Teacher Discipline**: It's crucial to recognize that parents and teachers play different roles in a child's life and, as such, may need to adopt different discipline methods. Highlighting this difference and tailoring your suggested alternatives accordingly would strengthen your argument and provide a more nuanced perspective.

5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While your essay is generally well-written, paying close attention to spelling, grammar, and stylistic choices will further enhance its readability and impact. Avoiding long sentences and using simpler language can make your essay more accessible to a wider audience.

6. **Supporting Arguments with Examples**: Including more specific examples or references to studies could add credibility to your arguments and help illustrate your points more vividly.

In conclusion, your essay successfully communicates a compassionate stance on child discipline. By refining your essay's structure, clearly distinguishing between different discipline approaches, and ensuring your language is clear and straightforward, you can make your argument more compelling and aligned with English proficiency test expectations.",4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,1,Argumentative

The fact that this industry makes this amount of money every year shows that people get addicted increasingly. Today, worldwide, hundreds of millions of people play video games. They spend hours and hours without getting bored, and they spend a lot of money as well. The question is: why? There are two main causes of video game addiction: profound pleasure and escape from the real world. \n First, most gamers play video games in order to gain intense pleasure. When playing video games, especially the latest ones, one feels massive pleasure because of the unbelievable quality of the games. gamers play for long hours and they neither feel bored nor tired. With that in mind, while playing video games, most people feel excluded from the world around them, which is a positive thing because you do not get to hear people nonsense around you. Besides, gamers get sensational feelings from winning, whereas when they lost, they get anxious and angry, which makes them play for other hours to compensate these feelings. \n Second, lots of gamers play video games so that they can escape reality. When you are playing video games, the rest of the world disappears because you are intensely into the games. Moreover, feeling depressed and tired from life, gamers find video games the best from those sensations. In fact, many of them acknowledge the fact that it helped them overcome depression. Furthermore, it not only helps them forget the everyday problems, but it also enhances their moods to the better. Although this might seem a positive solution in the short run, it will have negative effects eventually, which all gamers must know. \n To conclude, video games have a couple main causes, which can have negative and positive outcomes simultaneously. Most gamers know that they are addicted, but they do not acknowledge it, which is quite a problem. Getting more money annually, the video game industry will keep improving and producing games, which is something that gamers have to find a solution to so that they can decrease their addiction. Otherwise, they will get nowhere in their lives if they keep wasting too much time playing them.","Dear student, this essay is based upon unfounded assumptions. As an informative essay, it does provide information that relates to your chosen topic. The problem, is that the information lacks warranted examples and factual sources of information. There is a need for you to better develop the presentation based on facts. For example, when you say that video game companies make billions of dollars a year, you need to provide proof of that through the presentation of various game sales based on the hot titles of the year. That way, you prove your assumption in the essay. Now, when you say that video game players use this as a form of escapism, you need to cite professional sources to support that claim. Remember, an essay that provides information without sources, is a faulty essay. It is not capable of defending itself because of empty claims and lack of sources. If you want to make this essay stronger, cite professional and academic sources throughout the presentation. That is, provided that this is an essay for a formal English writing class and not just a practice essay for language development. If you are just using this essay topic for language development, then you did a pretty good job of presenting your case. It is convincing in a basic manner but not fully acceptable as an academic paper.","This essay addresses the topic of video game addiction effectively by identifying two main causes: seeking intense pleasure and escaping reality. However, to strengthen the essay, it's crucial to base your arguments on concrete facts and sources. For instance, when mentioning that the video game industry makes billions of dollars annually, providing specific figures from credible sources would add weight to this claim. Similarly, when discussing video game addiction as a form of escapism, referencing studies or expert opinions would substantiate your argument more convincingly.

The essay has a clear structure, and the point of view is understandable. However, there are several opportunities for improvement in terms of spelling, grammar, and stylistic choices. For example, some sentences could benefit from a closer review to eliminate grammatical errors and enhance clarity. Consider breaking up complex ideas into shorter sentences to make the essay more reader-friendly.

Moreover, while your essay outlines the negative and positive outcomes of video game addiction, it would be beneficial to explore these aspects in greater detail. For instance, discussing the long-term impacts of addiction can provide a more rounded perspective on the issue. Also, incorporating examples of how individuals or communities have addressed these challenges could offer practical insights into managing or overcoming addiction.

In summary, focusing on the following aspects can improve your essay substantially:
1. Back up your statements with evidence from credible sources.
2. Review the essay for spelling, grammar, and stylistic improvements.
3. Deepen the discussion on the consequences of video game addiction and possible solutions.
4. Simplify complex sentences to enhance readability and ensure your message is conveyed effectively.

First of all, many non-rnvironmental organizations are established to preserve natural habitats and promote sustainable development, such as WWf. More to the point, with the rapid growth of technology, news about wild animals and birds are quickly shared on the Internet. In simple terms, the reports which is relevant to the environment's damage or a species with extinction are updated daily. In conclusion, preserving wild animals and birds is of concern to people because the lack of any species is at the expense to the loss of the balance which harms human's life. \n In addition,government invest too much money costly on facilities and safety for animals that in danger. National budget should be allocated to more urgent issues rather than expended on the conservation of animals, which is from nature, and birds. For example, national resources, such as budger, land, etc. should be invested to medical research to find out remedies. Consequently, existence of wild animals and birds is vital though, people should channel resources to society's compelling matter, instead of animals' issues too many. \n In conclusion, protecting wild animals and birds is attracting people's attention and resources exaggeratedly.

I cannot hazard a guess about which of the 2 discussion types to use for your work as it may result in my giving you inappropriate or non-applicable advice. Therefore, I am forced to only give you only general comments in relation to the GRA section of your writing. \n When writing an academic essay, it is better to avoid using words that indicate a lack of conciseness in your presentation.

While the effort to explore this issue is commendable, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

1. Response to the topic: The essay attempts to engage with the topic but seems to navigate between two different standpoints without clearly stating the essay question or specific prompt it is responding to. It is crucial to directly address the specific question or statement provided in the essay prompt to ensure relevance and focus.

2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic issues: There are numerous spelling mistakes (e.g., ""fas"" instead of ""far"", ""thera"" instead of ""there"", ""publicy"" instead of ""the public"", ""WWf"" instead of ""WWF"", ""budger"" instead of ""budget"") which detract from the overall quality and readability of the essay. Additionally, there are grammatical errors, such as subject-verb disagreements (""human are"" should be ""humans are"" or ""human is"") and incorrect article usage. To convey ideas more effectively, avoid vague expressions like ""Perhaps no subject..."" and opt for more definitive statements. Ensure that acronyms are correctly spelled and that sentences are concise and clear.

3. Point of view clarity: The essay's point of view appears to be divided. Initially, it seems to sympathize with the importance of preserving wildlife but then argues that resources should be reallocated to other societal issues. This dual perspective confuses the reader about the author's definitive stance. A more consistent and explicit expression of viewpoint would significantly benefit the essay.

4. Arguments and support: The essay tries to present arguments for both the importance of preserving animals and the need to prioritize other issues. However, these arguments are not fully developed or convincingly supported. Providing concrete examples, factual evidence, or specific data could strengthen the arguments. Also, ensuring a logical flow between points would help in building a coherent argument.

In summary, focusing on directly answering the essay prompt, correcting spelling and grammatical errors, clarifying the point of view, and strengthening arguments with clear, supportive evidence will greatly improve the essay. Lastly, remember to revise and proofread your work to avoid unnecessary mistakes. This process is crucial for crafting a well-presented and compelling essay.",2,3,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

What are the causes and how to solve this.","It is true that the unemployed situation is faced by the young in contemporary society. There are many reasons for this, but this situation should be addressed in some practical ways. \n It is evident to have two reasons why unemployment has been widespread in recent decades. One reason is that young graduates lack work experience and a great number of graduates have an unrealistic expectation of career, regardless of their studying performance. For example, graduates from universities who lack life experience would negatively be a springboard to the overburden of society. Another reason is that employers are not inclined to hire young workers because those who belong to the young group do not have an outstanding contribution to firms. To specify, a great number of young workers in some countries tend to work to gain experience rather than achieving huge success for their companies that they are working for. \n There are several actions that individuals could take to solve this problem described above. Firstly, schools should set up more programs that enable students to have a realistic view of point about life, which is closely related to their field. For instance, tours visiting hospitals or factories would have a key factor influencing this. Secondly, businesses should have more place for an internship that young workers can apply to. To illustrate, only when the young have a good condition, will they place an importance on the companies' benefits, not to mention the advancement of the nation. \n In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as unemployment is too common in the young.","<quotation>It is true that the unemployed situation is faced by the young in contemporary society</quotation> \n - Upon what information is this claim being made? Are you being asked to testify to the validity of a claim in the original prompt? You were not. You were not asked to provide an opinion nor attestation on your part. Such unsupported written information creates misinformation in your prompt restatement, It removes the accuracy of your depiction of the original discussion topic and will result in percentage deductions for your TA score. It may be enough to kick off your score, based on individual scoring considerations, at a failing mark. Always strive for restatement accuracy to help increase, rather than decrease your TA score. \n Why did you avoid directly responding to the questions provided? The questions require a direct response in the thesis portion of the restatement as these are used to assess your understanding of the given prompt, and your ability to provide applicable responses, in English. The topic outline is a major part of your TA scoring consideration as these responses help the examiner assess the clarity of your opinion / understanding of the discussion requirements. \n Though you presented 2 discussion reasons in your discussion paragraph, you wasted the first sentence since you used an irrelevant sentence starter in the presentation. You should have used that sentence allowance midstream instead, using it to create a transition sentence from the first to the second discussion point. Without the transition sentence, your presentation comes across as requiring further development. Rather than the wasted first sentence, I would have written a useful transition sentence in the manner of: \n <em>It is precisely because of the lack of work experience that businesses are not inclined to hire fresh graduates...</em> \n That transition sentence helps to strengthen the first claim that you made, increasing the cohesiveness and coherence of that presentation paragraph. \n The solutions paragraph has an under developed first solution. It does not relate to the second reason. The second reason is more related, as a solution, to the previously presented reasoning subjects. As for the conclusion, you need to further develop that to use at least 40 words or 2 sentences.

Yet, certain areas could be improved to enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of the arguments presented.

1. The opening statement makes a broad assertion about unemployment without presenting supporting evidence or directly addressing the questions posed in the essay prompt. For a stronger introduction, clearly state the essay's objective and how it will address the topic. Avoid making unsourced claims, as they can undermine the credibility of the essay.

2. The essay transitions between ideas can be improved for better flow and coherence. Instead of beginning discussion paragraphs with sentences that do not directly connect to the subsequent points, use transition phrases that link ideas together. For example, a sentence like ""It is precisely because of the lack of work experience that businesses are not inclined to hire fresh graduates..."" could effectively bridge two related points about the challenges young people face in finding employment, thereby enhancing the logical flow of the argument.

3. The solutions offered to address unemployment among the young are relevant but require further development. The first solution does not fully address the second reason provided for youth unemployment. It’s essential to ensure that proposed solutions directly tackle the problems identified in the discussion. For more compelling arguments, expand on how these solutions can be implemented and their potential impact on reducing unemployment rates among young people.

4. The conclusion of the essay needs to be strengthened. It should summarize the key points discussed and reiterate the significance of addressing the issue at hand. A well-developed conclusion consists of at least 40 words or 2 sentences, providing closure to the essay and reinforcing its main arguments.

4497,https://essayforum.com/writing/reasons-bigger-wage-celebrities-politicians-86954/,test,What are the reasons for bigger wage for celebrities than politicians? Evaluate this development.,"With the rapid development of Internet, lifestyle of entertainment stars is now profoundly shaping the preference and interest of general public. Commercial brands now tend to invest on these celebrities which make these celebrities gain more income than politicians. I do believe this is a negative trend for the society. Two of the principal reasons are explained as follows. \n Firstly, politicians are usually with higher education background and reputation. On the contrary, there is a relatively lower requirement for singers or actors. If a celebrity who is not even college-graduated can earn more than a well-educated politician, it definitely spreads a wrong message to the youngsters that studying is not necessarily the key to success. The fact can be proved by the increasing number of teenagers giving up university study to join singing contest, which also reflects their tendency to take shortcut to be famous and rich, instead of equipping themselves with knowledge. \n Further and more importantly, celebrities getting too much economic power can be a threat to our political development. For instance, current US President Donald Trump was once a renowned host of TV show. Taking advantage of his popularity, he became the most powerful man in the Status for the past years. However, the way he leads the country is widely criticized due to the lack of political mindset and knowledge. So I believe these important role should be reserved for well trained politicians. \n In conclusion, income earned by politicians should remain high enough to encourage capable candidates to contribute and improve the society. It is undoubtedly a negative trend to have entertainment stars takeover the superior status of politicians in our community.","FYI, Donald Trump is a graduate of the Wharton School of Business. He is not just a celebrity. Before he became a celebrity, He was a military school graduate, and a college graduate. As a professional, he was a hugely successful businessman who led the Trump Organization for decades until he divested himself in favor of his children. He dealt with politicians and celebrities as a real estate mogul long before he became a TV host. So he is not the right person to use as an example in this instance. He has political knowledge and a politician's mindset, it is just not of the common political kind. \n Your opening paraphrase does not reflect the original prompt. You used information that does not exist in the original presentation. It need to stick to the original topic representation. You could have said: \n <em>Superstars have a greater earning power than politicians these days. The reason for the reverse in income for these 2 occupations are caused by (present 2 connected reasons). Thinking about these reasons, I am convinced that this trend should be seen as a negative occurrence.</em> \n Your second reasoning paragraph totally disconnects from the given discussion instruction. The focus on Donald Trump doesn't make sense. He was already rich before he became a celebrity. Your opinion in that paragraph does not connect to the reason why celebrities earn more than politicians or vice versa. Always double check the original prompt against your draft discussion. Make sure you stay on track, do not deviate, you will receive points deductions for that in the TA and word count section. If your essay, without the irrelevant paragraph falls under the minimum word count, your essay score will be in trouble in the end.","Your essay addresses an interesting topic about the influence of entertainers on society and their comparison with politicians in terms of income and societal impact. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to make your argument stronger and more relevant to the topic. 

Firstly, it’s crucial that your essay directly responds to the given topic accurately and clearly. The introduction should more closely align with the original prompt by clarifying why there is a disparity in income between celebrities and politicians, and then presenting your viewpoint on why this trend is negative. A suggested revision could be to directly state the influence of celebrity culture on societal values and its comparison with the political landscape, then introduce your arguments.

In terms of content, using specific examples is a good strategy for strengthening your argument. However, the choice of Donald Trump as an example might not be effective for your argument. It's important to use examples that accurately support your point. Donald Trump had a diverse career that included significant business achievements before he became a television personality and later President. This complexity makes him less suitable as an example for your argument about celebrities lacking the appropriate background for political leadership. Consider using different examples that more clearly support your argument about the impact of celebrity culture on societal values and political engagement.

Additionally, there are spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues to address:
1. Be cautious with spelling and grammar. For example, ""Internet"" should not be capitalized unless it starts a sentence, and ""Status"" should be ""States"".
2. When discussing collective groups like ""entertainment stars,"" ensure you maintain consistency in your argument's perspective.
3. Ensure clarity in your arguments by more directly connecting your reasoning with your thesis statement, avoiding any potential deviation from the topic.

Regarding the structure of your essay, it would be beneficial to more closely connect your arguments with the thesis statement to maintain focus on the discussion topic. Make sure each paragraph supports your position in a clear and direct manner. Your second reasoning paragraph seems to diverge from the main topic, which could detract from the overall cohesiveness of your essay. Keeping your arguments relevant and directly tied to the topic will help in presenting a clear and persuasive essay.

In summary, your essay presents some compelling points but could be significantly improved by adhering more closely to the topic, choosing more relevant examples, and addressing the spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. Focusing on these areas will make your argument more persuasive and your writing clearer to the reader. Remember to always double-check that each part of your essay contributes directly to supporting your main argument, and ensure your examples accurately reflect the points you're trying to make.",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,1,Argumentative

To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Recently, it is true that criminal rate has been becoming increasingly prominent in a large number of nations , as a result, allocating more police publicly is believed to be an effective method. While I agree that this policy gain the advantages in some ways, I also concur that other approaches should be adopted. \n At the outset, there are a number of compelling reasons that why having more police is remarkably advocated. The very first reason is that the presence of police on the streets keeps the public security stable. That the offenders commit crimes can be attributed to the lack of cautious surveilance. Thus, by proliferating the quantity of police officers, illegal activities are likely to be prevented. Secondly, fear of increasing crimes among citizens has emerged as common concerns in countries for ages, so the need for more cops to carry on the fight against threaten crimes is apparent. Futhermore,it also creates a sense of safety for society as the risks of crimes tend to be reported instantly especially in case the police offices are too far to make a statement. \n Apart from the argument mentioned above, I am of the opinion that other measures to diminish crime proportion should be implemented. As the crimes are increasing rapidly, urgent actions are required. One of the most effective policy is to enact more rigorous legislation. A prolonged jail sentence, for example, would prevent criminals from committing crimes as they would avoid serving that sentence at all cost. Simultaneously, utilizing government coffers on educational reforms should be taken into account since the inadequacy of basic education leads to the growth of crimes. Poor education is likely to put a restriction on employment opportunities which causes people to offend against law so as to get money for their survival. Hence, upgrading academic systems is worth being considered by government. \n In summary, while the benefits of adding more police make it seem like a good idea, I believe that there are variety of more different ways to deal with this situation.","This is not a comparative essay. You wrote it in a manner that does not properly respond to the task requirement. The task requirement is to have you explain your response to the question: <em>To what extent do you agree or disagree.</em> The response to the question should be clearly provided in the response discussion outline of the prompt paraphrase (I strongly agree / disagree) for further development in the reasoning paragraphs. \n As a single opinion essay, you must focus on presenting 2 supporting opinions for your response. That is lacking in this essay. You have not provided a clear opinion in support of the given question. There is no room to discuss alternative solutions because that was never indicated as a discussion direction in the original prompt. Overall, the essay fails to meet the response requirements for this task and will end up getting a failing score.","The essay you've written ventures into the issue of rising criminal rates and the consideration of increasing police presence as a potential solution, alongside the proposition of alternative methods for addressing this issue. However, to elevate your essay to meet the expectations of English proficiency tests, a few aspects need to be refined. 

Firstly, it's important to align your essay closely with the prompt's requirements. The task asked for your stance on a specific statement, essentially inquiring, ""To what extent do you agree or disagree?"" The expected structure involves presenting your opinion clearly right from the introduction and then supporting this view with relevant arguments in the body paragraphs. This clarity in your stance was somewhat missing. For future essays, consider starting with a sentence like ""I strongly agree/disagree that…"" to ensure the reader is immediately aware of your position.

Regarding the content, while your essay commendably explores both the benefits of increasing police presence and alternative solutions to crime, such as enhanced legislation and educational reforms, it diverges from the prompt's focus. The prompt sought an evaluation of an increase in police numbers rather than a discussion on alternative crime reduction strategies. Concentrating on backing your viewpoint—whether it's in favor or against the increase in police presence—with solid reasons and examples will make your argument more compelling and on-topic.

In terms of language and structure, there are a few areas for improvement:
- Watch out for spelling errors and strive for correct word choices (e.g., ""criminal rate"" should be ""crime rate,"" ""surveilance"" should be ""surveillance,"" and ""threaten crimes"" should be ""threatening crimes"").
- Your essay occasionally struggles with grammatical consistency and accuracy, such as the proper use of articles (“allocating more police publicly” might be better phrased as “increasing public police presence”) and verb tense consistency.
- Aim for clarity and coherence in your arguments. For instance, ensure that when you mention a new idea, it is explored sufficiently and ties back to your main argument or standpoint.

Stylistically, varying your sentence structure can enhance the readability of your essay. Melding simple, compound, and complex sentences adds rhythm to your writing, making it more engaging for the reader.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is sometimes argued that many countries should prioritize domestic food production and minimize imports. While I understand the logic behind this suggestion. I still firmly disagree with it for sveral reasons. \n Those who believe that each country need prioritization of domestic food production and restrict to import it may have several reasons. They may well argue that the population has increased rapidly, which leads to food shortages in the not too distance future. For instance, each family has about 2 or 3 children due to the policies in their country. This may double or trible the populations and be responsible for the fact that there are more and more poor people and homelessness will appear. Another possible argument is that there is a rate of industrialisation in many developed and developing countries leading to a decline of agriculture. There are more industrial factories attracting people and making them leave countrysides, farms to go to cities, which may cause the lack of labour in farming and harvesting. \n Nevertheless, I still disagree that food manufacture is necessary and minimized imported food is important in some countries for several factors . Chief among these is that some social problem can lower population growth. Variety of issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, teen suicide are not only not causing an increase in populations but also a decrease in it. This may significantly contribute to the decline of population growth. The second reason is that the governments are introduced many policies which provide more opportunities for workers to develope agriculture. These policies will encourage them to farm, thereby giving financial incentives to employees during their work. \n In conclusion, it is understandable why may argue that some countries need to manufacture and minimized imported food due to their domestic demand. However, I cannot support such a view given aforementioned reasons.","It is not important to the reviewer that you explain why people might support the point of view that opposes your own. He does not care why other people would support a certain point of view. What he would like to see is why your opinion should be considered the correct one. What strong reasons do you have for your point of view? These reasons should be explained over 2 paragraphs. Or, you should have explained why the existing point of view, that opposes yours is incorrect. That is why the reviewer is looking for. Since you did not fully support your opinion, he will be forced to score your essay on an under developed explanation consideration which, could lead to a low passing score for you.","The essay addresses the topic concerning whether countries should prioritize domestic food production over imports. While the essay responds to the prompt, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, structure, and argumentation.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay begins by presenting a counterargument but does not thoroughly develop the author's own viewpoint. The main argument - disagreeing with prioritizing domestic food production - is mentioned, but the reasoning behind this stance is not fully explored. It's crucial to clearly state and support your own position. Instead of focusing on why others might disagree, concentrate on providing strong, clear reasons for your own perspective. This includes expanding on your arguments with more detail and evidence over the course of the essay.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are spelling mistakes (e.g., ""sveral"" should be ""several"") and grammatical errors that hinder clarity and flow. Pay attention to sentence structure to ensure clear and coherent expression of ideas. Consider using tools or resources to check for and correct these errors. Additionally, look to vary sentence structure to enhance the readability of your essay.

3. **Clear Point of View:** Your point of view is stated, but it's somewhat lost amid discussions of opposing viewpoints without sufficient explanation or support for your own position. Make your stance the focal point of the essay by directly addressing and reinforcing it throughout your writing. 

4. **Descriptive Arguments:** The essay mentions potential arguments for both sides but lacks depth in supporting the author's position. For a stronger essay, focus on developing your arguments more thoroughly. This can be achieved by providing specific examples, facts, or statistics to back up your points. When discussing the decline in population growth because of social issues or government policies to support agriculture, delve deeper into how these directly impact and support your stance against prioritizing domestic over imported food.

In conclusion, refining the focus on your own viewpoint by elaborating on your reasons and supporting them with clear, specific examples will create a more persuasive and compelling essay. Paying attention to spelling and grammar will also greatly improve the readability and professionalism of your writing. Lastly, remember that developing your argument clearly and coherently is key to persuading your readers to consider your perspective.",3,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,Argumentative
4500,https://essayforum.com/writing/suggest-schools-make-teenagers-spend-92875/,test,IELTS Writing Task 2: Some suggest that schools should make teenagers spend a short time working,"It is argued that beside the tuition of academic subjects, schools should provide students with chances to get work experience. From my point of view, the young will benefit from this sensible movement. \n First off, in order to become refreshingly employable, not only do graduates acquire proper qualifications but they also need a wide range of work based skills such as networking and time management. Although students work on projects at school, which probably train them in such abilities, there are many things to be learnt on the job. For example, cooperating with colleagues is a far cry from doing assignments with friends since teenagers have no concern about earnings or promotion. Without practical experience, they might hold the false assumption that studying subjects at school is enough for work. \n Furthermore, getting involved in a real-life professional environment goes a long way towards directing students' career paths. Those who have not set their hearts on anything yet can find out their desires in this way. For people who have realised their ambitions, they can check whether the current choices suit them. As a result, students avoid wasting their university years on unappealing disciplines. \n In conclusion, it is necessary that work time account for an appropriate proportion of the curriculum, so that the young prepare themselves better for employment in the future.","The student is getting his word meanings confused. He must increase his English vocabulary and word usage understanding in order to avoid unitentional misinterpretations of the prompt topics. If he will bother to look up the word meaning difference between ""suggest"" and argue, he will come to understand why his interpretation of the topic and its foundational reason is incorrect. \n It will also serve him well to familiarize himself with the various response formats required for the task 2 essays. There are opinion essays, dis/agree essays, and measured response essays. The writer did not properly identify the response format as required (measured response) and provided another incorrect presentation in terms of his opinion. \n Based on these 2 first paragraph errors, the essay will start with a failing score. He did not correctly restate the prompt, nor did he provide the expected response in the presentation. The foundation of the discussion and reasoning response are invalid. \n While the resaoning paragraphs can be deemed as related to the original discussion question, the inaccurate representation in both the prompt restatement + personal opinion and concluding summary are what may prevent this essay from receiving a passing score in an actual setting.","Your essay is organized and presents a clear viewpoint on why schools should offer students opportunities for work experience. Not only does the essay maintain a consistent argument supporting this idea, but it also effectively uses examples to illustrate points. However, there are several areas where improvements could be made to enhance clarity, accuracy, and overall effectiveness. Here’s how:

1. **Topic Response and Essay Structure**: Your essay could more accurately reflect the task's objective by clarifying the distinction between ""suggesting"" and ""arguing."" This distinction is crucial in understanding the prompt's requirement and establishing a solid foundation for your argument. Additionally, familiarizing yourself with different essay formats, such as opinion essays versus measured response essays, will help you meet specific task requirements more effectively. This adjustment is essential because the format you've chosen does not entirely align with the expected response structure, impacting the clarity of your argument.

2. **Vocabulary and Word Usage**: Enhancing your English vocabulary and understanding of word usage will significantly benefit your essay. Some instances in your essay suggest confusion with word meanings, leading to potential misinterpretations of key topics. This is particularly important when discussing complex topics or presenting nuanced arguments. Improving in this area will help you articulate your ideas more precisely and avoid misunderstandings.

3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**: The essay has a few spelling and grammatical issues that need attention. Additionally, maintaining a formal style throughout the essay, avoiding colloquial expressions, and ensuring sentence structures are varied yet coherent can make your argument more compelling.

4. **Clear Argumentation and Support**: While your essay does offer arguments in support of the stated viewpoint, ensuring these arguments are directly tied to the essay prompt's core question could strengthen your position. It's important to closely examine how each point made relates back to the essay’s main thesis, ensuring a cohesive and strong argument throughout.

Making these adjustments will not only clarify your position but also ensure your essay aligns more closely with the expectations for this type of writing task. It will also enhance the overall quality of your writing, making your arguments more impactful and your essay more engaging to the reader.

I will talk about both points of view and also share my own ideas as well. \n From one side, data and knowledge bring a lot of power with itself. And there are people who share their knowledge with everybody. There are the people who push the world forward. Because when the data or results from their work are available, others can extend the findings or even invent something new. \n On the other hand, there are companies or people that always try to hide their findings, sometimes the data is critical or in some cases secret (e.g. military information) which is understandable, why they can't present them to the public. But in some cases, it is because of the selfishness of one person. for example, apple inc. always tries to hide the new inventions and doesn't publish any papers about their work, And it is the reason why scientists are not willing to work for them because their work will remain anonymous. \n In my own opinion, everyone should publish the information they have, of course with the right copyright statement. It makes their work much more valuable. For example, I always publish my works and it gives me the joy to watch people extend it. People always appreciate that and no one ever misses my findings. \n In conclusion, there are two types of people. Some people think it is alright to share the information with the world.

The first, is the problem pertaining to how you develop your discussion sentences. There is a basic grammar rule in English writing that indicates a writer cannot start a sentence with a connecting word because a connecting word requires the presence of previous information in the same sentence in order to be effectively used. You violated this rule twice in the second paragraph. You know which words I am referring to (And, Because). \n The second observation I have relates again, to your grammar structure in relation to the coherence and cohesiveness section of the essay. As you know, the main requirement for the C&C section is that complete paragraphs need to be presented in order to be accurately scored for the section. Yet, in your opening paraphrase and third paragraph, you have run-on sentences presented. This will result in points deductions. Each thought must be indicated as a separate sentence in order to allow for a proper explanation and appropriate grammatical presentation in the paragraph. \n I have to make one additional observation before I close my message to you. Do not place examples in a parenthesis. Any examples presented in these essays need to be developed as full supporting statements for an opinion presented. When you place it in a parenthesis, it doesn't have any bearing nor contribution to the discussion.","Your essay addresses the topic and explores both perspectives on sharing versus withholding information, in addition to offering your personal viewpoint. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, coherence, and grammatical correctness of your essay.

1. **Topic Response and Clarity**: You have clearly outlined the two sides of the argument concerning the sharing of information and added your standpoint, which is an excellent approach. It's important to ensure that your essay directly addresses the question and that your point of view is consistent and well-articulated throughout.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Watch out for starting sentences with conjunctions like ""And"" or ""Because.” These words link ideas within a sentence and should not be used to start a sentence. Instead, combine sentences or rephrase them to avoid this error. Additionally, there are instances of run-on sentences, particularly in your introduction and third paragraph. Each sentence should present a single idea for clarity and coherence. Separating or restructuring these could significantly enhance the readability of your essay.

3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your viewpoint is present but could be strengthened with more precise language and better-structured arguments. Clear statement of your opinion with a sentence explicitly outlining your view at the beginning or end of the essay would help.

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you provide examples, such as the reference to Apple Inc., placing examples or important details in parentheses minimizes their impact. Instead, integrate these examples into your main text as complete sentences to support your arguments more effectively. Remember, each example should be fully explored and tied directly back to your main argument to add weight to your position.

To improve your essay:

- Avoid sentence fragments and run-on sentences by using proper punctuation and ensuring that each sentence expresses a complete thought.
- Improve the structure of your arguments. Present each point in a new paragraph, and within those paragraphs, clearly separate your ideas into individual sentences.
- Expand on your examples outside of parentheses, providing a fuller explanation of how they support your argument.
- Pay close attention to your introduction and conclusion, ensuring they succinctly summarise your main points and reiterate your position.

To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Some people think it a good idea to stay in their jobs when they grow old. Personally, I strongly disagree with them on this matter. I will elaborate my arguments as follows. \n The primary reason that the elderly should retire is that they are physically fragile. Their immunity is certain to deteriorate with age, so that they are more vulnerable to illness. For them, the likelihood is extraordinarily high of falling ill under the stress in the workplace. When struck by disease, they also have difficulties in recovering readily, and thus, the conditions can be chronic. Considering the potential risk of healthy problems, it is unwise for them to continue working. \n Furthermore, even though a few people maintain robust health at their old age, they should withdraw from their occupation too - because it is a painful struggle for them to keep up with the times. In the age of technological innovation, many job sectors have undergone disruptive change, forcing professionals in these fields to learn from scratch and explore the unknown. This is just the serious weak point of the elderly, who tend to be conservative and not open to novelties. They usually stick to existing tools or solutions, reluctant to exercise their creativity. For this reason, the best option for them is to simply bow out of the employment market. \n To recapitulate, infirmity due to age proves a major hurdle to the career development of older people. The era of technological revolution also poses formidable challenges to them. Therefore, they should withdraw from their occputation at a ripe old age, despite their eagerness to continue their professional pursuit. \n This time, I tried to make some improvements accordingly.

The stance against elderly employment is clear throughout, which is a strength. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance the essay's overall quality and coherence. Here’s a detailed feedback focusing on the specified aspects:

1. **Response to Topic**: The essay addresses the topic effectively, arguing against the idea of elderly individuals staying in employment. The points raised are relevant and directly support the thesis statement, which is a positive aspect.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**:
    - Consider revising phrases to be more natural in English. For example, “the potential risk of healthy problems” should be “the potential risk of health problems”. This minor adjustment makes the sentence clearer and more accurate.
    - When mentioning aging individuals maintaining their health, it’s more natural to say “health in their old age” rather than “robust health at their old age"".
    - Be mindful of using conjunctions and punctuation correctly to improve sentence flow. For example, “their occupation too - because it...” could be smoother without the dash: “their occupation too, because it...”.
    - Avoid unnecessary words that don’t add value to the sentence. Instead of saying “This is just the serious weak point…” simply stating “This is a serious weakness…” maintains the meaning more succinctly.
    - Pay attention to collocation and natural English expression to enhance fluency. 

3. **Clarity of Author’s Point of View**: The essay's point of view is clear and consistently articulated throughout the text. The author’s strong disagreement with the statement is evident. However, reinforcing this stance in the conclusion would make the argument even stronger and more cohesive.

4. **Arguments and Descriptions**:
    - The arguments presented are clear and logically structured. Each paragraph introduces a new aspect of why elderly individuals might struggle in the workforce, making the essay’s position compelling.
    - To further strengthen the essay, consider adding examples or more detailed explanations to support the arguments. This could involve citing studies or hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the difficulties elderly workers face.

**Additional Suggestions**:
- The conclusion does a good job of summarizing the essay's main points but misses an opportunity to reiterate the author’s position. Restating your disagreement with the idea of elderly employment in the conclusion would reinforce your stance and provide a stronger closure to the essay.
- Endeavor to smooth over the fluency issues primarily by reading extensively and paying attention to how arguments are constructed in English. This practice will help in using more natural expressions and avoiding errors that may distract from the message.

Overall, the essay makes a compelling argument and demonstrates good understanding of the topic. With some revisions for language fluency, clarity, and argument development, it can be improved further.

This may result from a parallel development between the world and demand in humans' ability. To be more specific, a cadre of individuals who are the best will be provided with opportunities: they receive a profitable job or cooperate with intriguing partners. Otherwise, people who cannot keep up with the pace will end up at second-tier firms and fall into an abyss of personal social status descent. Another contributor to this unease trend is that people have become more materialistic. Such judgments about one's living condition made by a cursory glance at their accessories have stimulated and perpetuated employees' work ethic. \n It is indisputable that excess work will lead to some demerits.

Consequently, this reduction possibly triggers obesity or depression. Furthermore, not only the individuals become victims but also the society. It is rational that a rocketed number of employees undergoing ailments places a burden on the healthcare system. Such disorders as corpulence or insomnia require long-term treatment and constant check out, leading to an exorbitant cost. \n In conclusion, extended working hours are a global crisis triggered by a demanding world and a material fetish lifestyle, which results in aggravation of humans well-being and the healthcare insurance system.","Okay.

The attempt to dissect the problem through different lenses - societal competition and materialism, and its effects on individual health and the broader healthcare system - showcases an understanding of the complexity of the issue.

However, the clarity and impact of the message are somewhat diminished by the use of overly complex vocabulary and sentence structures. It's important to remember that simplicity often enhances comprehension and engagement with the reader. The essay would benefit significantly from using more straightforward language, making it more accessible to a wider audience and more in line with English proficiency test expectations that prioritize clear and effective communication over the demonstration of an extensive vocabulary.

In terms of organization, the essay is structured effectively with an introduction, body paragraphs discussing the causes and effects, and a conclusion. This structure helps maintain a logical flow, making it easier for readers to follow the argument. However, some sentences could be simplified to ensure that the points made are direct and comprehensible. 

While it is commendable to aim for sophisticated language to convey depth of knowledge, in this context, it is equally important to prioritize readability and clarity. For instance, phrases like ""supplement competitive society"" or ""corpus of individuals"" may confuse rather than elucidate. In future essays, strive for clarity and precision in language to enhance the overall persuasiveness of your argument.

The essay's point of view is clear, with a critical stance on the issue of overworking. Yet, the arguments would be more compelling with concrete examples or data to back them up. For instance, referencing studies on health effects of overwork or statistics on work hours and their societal impacts would add weight to the assertions made.

In conclusion, focusing on simplifying language for clarity, supporting arguments with data or examples, and maintaining the logical structure will greatly improve the effectiveness of future essays.

However, to enhance your essay further and align it with English proficiency standards, consider the following feedback focused on response to the topic, spelling and grammar issues, clarity of viewpoint, and the strength of your arguments.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay should remain neutral and focus on analyzing the topic rather than expressing a personal bias towards the positive aspects. Avoid stating a preference like ""the positive sides far outweigh the negative ones"" unless the essay prompt specifically asks for your opinion. The conclusion of your essay should summarize your points without introducing new opinions or evaluations of these points.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several areas where your spelling and grammar could be improved. For example:
   - ""juveniles are usually told that they can gain achievements when they have a hard-working process"" could be revised to ""juveniles are often told that hard work leads to achievements.""
   - Watch out for spelling mistakes (""achivements"" should be ""achievements,"" ""possitive"" should be ""positive,"" ""childrens"" should be ""children's,"" ""hight"" should be ""high,"" ""leavng"" should be ""leaving,"" ""yhe"" should be ""the"").
   - Pay attention to the use of singular and plural nouns (""this statement also have some advantages"" should be ""this statement also has some advantages"").
   - Use capital letters appropriately, especially ""I"" instead of “i”.

3. **Clarity of the Essay Author's Point of View**: Make sure your essay maintains an objective stance unless a personal viewpoint is requested. Your introduction suggests a personal perspective, which may not fully align with the essay's analytical nature. Furthermore, ensure your conclusion accurately summarizes the essay content without introducing new opinions or reflections on the value of the points discussed.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments present valid points but could be strengthened by providing specific examples or evidence. For instance, when discussing the negative effects of pressure on children, mentioning studies or statistics could enhance your argument. Similarly, when illustrating personal growth, providing concrete instances where hard work led to significant achievements for juveniles would make your argument more persuasive.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly improve the clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness of your essay, making it a stronger piece that meets the expectations of an English proficiency test.

1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay does engage with the topic at hand, discussing why sports celebrities might deserve their high incomes compared to other professions. However, your response could be more substantial by directly restating and clearly addressing the prompt. It's essential to ensure that your position on the topic is explicitly stated at the beginning to guide readers through your arguments.

Aim for at least 66 words per paragraph to meet the minimum requirement, ideally pushing your total essay towards 250-300 words for a more developed discussion. Expounding on your examples and providing more in-depth analysis will not only meet the word count but will also offer a nuanced understanding of your viewpoint.

3. **Grammar and Style**: Watch for spelling mistakes (""sastisfied"" should be ""satisfied,"" ""politicans"" should be ""politicians""), grammatical errors, and improper punctuation. Successive punctuation is discouraged. Instead, focus on clear and correct sentence structures to improve readability. For instance, rephrase parts of your essay for clarity and coherence, avoiding run-on sentences and ensuring each sentence contributes to your overall argument.

4. **Clarity of Position**: While your essay suggests a stance, articulating your viewpoint more clearly at the beginning will help. Make sure your thesis statement (the sentence that states your main point) is distinct and sets the tone for the following paragraphs. This will clarify your position for the reader right from the start.

5. **Argumentation and Support**: Your essay does provide reasons to support your viewpoint but consider adding more detailed examples and explanations to strengthen your arguments.

4506,https://essayforum.com/writing/internet-despite-significant-breakthrough-78655/,test,"The Internet, despite being the most significant breakthrough in history, is indeed a mixed blessing","With the advent of the Internet, students these days can easily access a large volume of information on any given subjects. This current trend has given rise to a controversial issue that educational institutions have become obsolete and that children can learn from home. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this statement for the following reasons. \n To start with, the overwhelming variety of learning resources would potentially be counterproductive without the instruction of a mentor. Home computers and Internet access are undeniably integral for students to look up information for research. Equally important, though, is the provision of guidance from teachers and parental supervision in making effective use of the world wide web. Lack of proper guidance could lead students to misleading and unreliable materials. Whereas, in a structured learning environment, course books are thoroughly designed by prominent and qualified authors, providing learners with suitable knowledge in a systematic way. \n On the other hand, upon the growing dominance of social networks such as Facebook, it seems that the Internet now offers even more distraction and unpleasantness than it has ever been. Thus, learners will likely succumb to the lure of chatting online instead of staying focused on their work. Besides, homeschooling will further entrench a worrying phenomenon that people these days would rather interact with electronic gadgets than engage in real human conversation . Therefore, the physical presence of a child in school or any other institution is of great importance, encouraging face to face communication and the development of interpersonal skills. \n In conclusion, the Internet, despite being the most significant breakthrough in history, is indeed a mixed blessing. Learners can only harness its power to the full under the orientation and instruction of highly qualified school teachers. Only in that way can the Internet serves as a valuable aid/ a complement to the national curriculum. \n (304 words)","Dear student, I think you can score a 6 with this essay. What lowered the score for this otherwise strong essay is how the essay did not fully develop the discussions in a connected manner and, your 3rd paragraph does not focus on the discussion of studying well at home. Consider that even at school, the distractions exist since the children still have internet connected phones, thus the focus on social media is the same as a distraction even in school. The focus of the essay discussion should only be on the educational side. Points to consider for this essay would be : \n 1. Traditionally, parents are the first teachers of children, thus making home schooling the default method of learning for most children. \n 2. Some home schooling parents believe that their children will learn better in a safe environment like home since school violence is on the rise. \n 3. Home schooled children still have to attend regular school for PE classes. A discussion that defeats your claim that home schooled children have weak social skills. \n In order to score better in these tests, you have to show a sense of familiarity with the topic. That means, looking for more interesting lines of reason as a defense instead of relying on the commonly presented model response essay discussions. I noticed that your response was similar to the model response for this essay so I am not sure if you would be able to properly respond to an original prompt in the test. In order to better assess your abilities. Let me pose an original IELTS type question for you to respond to. This is a new question I made up just for you so that I can assess if you have the ability to write a 9 band essay. \n <em>Prompt: Christmas is considered a religious holiday that excludes people of other faith from the celebrations. There is a growing sentiment that Christmas should not be celebrated and instead, it should be a regular holiday like Thanksgiving, without a religious connotation. That way everyone, regardless of faith, can participate in the festivities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Write at least 250 words.</em> \n Post your response as a new thread for me to comment on. This is the best way to assess your actual preparedness for the test.","Your essay provides a well-considered stance on the value of traditional educational institutions in the era of internet learning. You've brought up some strong points about the importance of guidance from educators and the risks posed by distractions online. However, there are ways to enhance your essay to make it more compelling and aligned with the criteria for a higher score. 

Firstly, the essay successfully addresses the topic by arguing that educational institutions are still necessary despite the wealth of information available online. This position is clear and maintained throughout your essay, which is a strength. 

However, the arguments could be better connected to form a more cohesive discussion. Each point introduced seems somewhat isolated from the others, and integrating these ideas more tightly could strengthen your overall argument. For example, when discussing distractions such as social media, it could be helpful to acknowledge that these distractions exist both in homes and schools but perhaps argue that the structured environment of schools can better mitigate these distractions.

Regarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is well-written but could benefit from slight adjustments for clarity and flow. You've managed to maintain a consistent point of view, which is commendable. However, refining the transitions between paragraphs and ideas could make your arguments more persuasive and easier to follow.

Your third paragraph introduces an important point about the distractions from social media and the value of face-to-face interactions. While valid, it may benefit from a deeper connection to the broader discussion of why home schooling doesn't necessarily offer a superior alternative to traditional schooling. Acknowledge that while social distractions exist in both settings, the structured support in schools may better prepare students to manage these distractions.

It's crucial to explore all sides of the argument more thoroughly. For instance, acknowledge some benefits of home schooling, such as personalized learning or safety, but then argue why these do not outweigh the benefits of a structured education received in schools. Also, consider the social skills developed through regular school activities, including physical education, which contradict the assumption that home-schooled children might lack in social abilities.

Lastly, your essay would benefit from incorporating more varied arguments and showing a deeper familiarity with the topic. This includes exploring counterarguments to your position and refuting them with evidence or logic. This approach demonstrates critical thinking and a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, which are important for achieving a higher score on the test.

To improve your writing and boost your score, consider these points when revising your essay or tackling new topics. Keep practicing, remain open to exploring various perspectives, and aim to build a more connected and nuanced argument in your essays.",4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative
4507,https://essayforum.com/writing/pollution-wastage-produced-common-people-86772/,test,{IELTS} More and more pollution and wastage produced. How common people are affected by pollution? \n What an individual can do to prevent it?,"In recent years, air pollution and wastage has risen dramatically, which has caused number of deterimental affects on common population. This essay will discuss some of those causes and measures that can be taken by individuals to deter their effects. \n One of the most significant issues pertaining to degrading quality of air is respiratory diseases. As an example, pollution in the city NewDelhi is so high that breathing there for 3 hours equals to smoking a cigarette as per the recent WHO survey. This is a pressing problem for common people because most of labour and essential workers spend most of their time during the day outside to fullfil their jobs. Therefore, they are exposed to pollution during the large portion of the day, disturbingly, which can decrease their life-span. Not only this, pollution has resulted in rising temperatures which has resulted in global warming around the world, which again brings more stress and difficulties on pockets of people as they will now have to spend more electricity to survive the hot day. \n Nevertheless, a number of measures can be implemented to control the increasing pollution, best of which is increasing the dependency on renewable resources for electricity rather than resources such as coal. In the recent survey, national pollution agency stated that in number of cities across india, 20% of the pollution is being caused due to the thermal power plants. Furthermore, mandating the use of high-efficiency vehicles and electric cars can create a significant reduction of pollution created by transport. \n To recapitulate, two main issues due to increased pollution that has been directly affecting common lives are respiratory problem and rising temperatures. However, such problem can be prevented by switching to non-conventional resources and electronic vehicles which will eventually control the falling air-quality.","When you are given direct questions to respond to in the original prompt, that means the essay is asking you to outline your discussion points in the prompt restatement. That means, in the first paragraph you should provide: \n - Sentence 1: An accurate restatement of the topic for discussion \n - Sentence 2: The direct response to the first question (topic outline) \n - Sentence 3: Direct response to the 2nd question (Topic 2 outline) \n As such, the essay is to be composed of 2 reasoning paragraphs that clearly represent one discussion topic per paragraph. Both of the reasoning paragraphs you have presented include a second reason at the end which is not fully explained. Such insertions will affect the clarity of your discussion and portray the paragraph as being under developed or lacking in explanation and supporting points. Never present a hanging 2nd discussion topic. Stick to one discussion topic per paragraph unless otherwise stated by the original prompt. This prompt requires only 1 effect and 1 solution discussion in relation to the effect presented. \n Try to develop a 3 sentence conclusion next time. It should be a proper summary of the original topic, your presented effect and solution, and a closing sentence that could add to the strength of your suggested solution. \n As of now, the grammar is a problem in your essay, but the bigger problem is the discussion presentation. That is why I focused on it in this review. If you no longer have a discussion format problem in your next essay, I can address other issues in your presentation already.","The essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the issues of air pollution and its detrimental effects, as well as potential measures to mitigate these effects. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make it more effective and responsive to the original topic.

Firstly, the structure of the essay could be enhanced by more clearly restating the topic in the introduction and by directly addressing the questions posed in the prompt. This involves outlining the main points of discussion right at the beginning, which would consist of identifying the specific problems caused by air pollution and then suggesting concrete solutions. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea; the current essay tends to introduce a secondary topic towards the end of paragraphs, which can confuse readers and detract from the clarity and development of the argument.

Secondly, there are noticeable spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that impact the readability and professionalism of the essay. For example, ""wastage"" should be corrected to ""waste,"" and ""deterimental affects"" should be ""detrimental effects."" Also, attention should be paid to proper spacing between words and avoiding run-on sentences to improve the overall flow and readability.

The point of view of the essay author is apparent, and there are descriptive arguments supporting the position taken. It's commendable that specific examples, such as the pollution situation in New Delhi, are used to illustrate points. However, these arguments could be strengthened by providing more detail and supporting evidence, and by ensuring that each paragraph is devoted to developing one clear main idea without introducing unrelated topics.

Finally, the conclusion of the essay should succinctly summarize the main points discussed, including both the problems and the proposed solutions, and should end with a strong closing sentence that reinforces the potential effectiveness of these solutions. Aim for a three-sentence conclusion to ensure a comprehensive summary and a conclusive end to your discussion.

To improve your next essay, focus on structuring your discussion more clearly, addressing grammatical and spelling errors, and ensuring each paragraph focuses on a single topic. This approach will enhance both the coherence and persuasiveness of your writing.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Some people think that the best way to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education in school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The increasing number of obese people is progressively a burden for health care system in an effort to cope with the related health problems. Some people suggest that making more physical education lessons mandatory in the school schedule is the best solution. As far as I am concerned, I totally agree with this statement. \n Firstly, physical education lessons are able to keep students in shape as well as good mood. Needless to say, exercising can reduce the amount of fat in students' bodies, allowing children to maintain their weight at a sufficient level. As a result, the number of obese children go down, leading to a downward trend in the total number of overweight people. For instance, the students who pay attention to their health are always in high spirits at school because they have attractive appearance and healthy bodies. Thus, keeping students in good shape both improve children health and decrease the rate of obesity. \n Another point is that several good habits of people emerge due to physical education in school. People can take care of themselves by consuming healthy diets as well as moderate exercises. After finishing school education, people are liable to maintain these habits, although there are many workloads surrounding them. Diets and exercises definitely cultivate their physical and mental health, thus providing them energy to work. Unless schools give them the rudiments of physical education, they are unable to do these things continuously. That is why, good habits at an early age is vitally important. \n In conclusion, physical education in school curriculum is inevitable because not only does it keep children in stable health condition but it also creates many good habits for people.","There is only a slight problem with your prompt paraphrase. Based on the original discussion, the suggestion for introducing physical education in the school curriculum is not mandatory. Therefore, you are in error and slightly deviating from the original discussion point in your paraphrase. Additionally, your topic representation is a bit confusing because you tried to restate the prompt using synonyms in word for word positions in the sentence. This led to a lack of clarity in the presentation. You do not have to change the presentation word for word. You have to restate the original topic based on your understanding, using your own words, not necessarily word for word replacements. A clearer representation would have been: \n <em>Health issues stemming from obesity are proving to be on the rise. Since most of the problems seem to be affecting students in school, there is a suggestion that the weight gain problem can be best addressed by coaxing students to participate in school based exercise programs. I fully support this suggestion due to several personal observations and insights.</em> \n Aside from this little oversight on your part, the rest of the essay is on point in relation to supporting a single opinion. Your discussions are cohesive, well connected, and uses good examples to help illustrate a personal observation or insight on the topic. Save for the original paraphrase situation and the extremely short conclusion, you may want to create a 3 sentence conclusion instead to properly do a reverse paraphrase of the presentation, this essay could probably achieve a 5 band score.","The essay provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of integrating physical education into school curricula to address obesity and instill healthy habits. However, there are areas that could benefit from improvement to enhance clarity, organization, and alignment with the essay prompt.

1. **Response to Topic**: The initial paraphrasing of the essay topic slightly deviates from the original suggestion regarding physical education in schools. It is mentioned as being mandatory, which was not explicitly stated in the prompt. For a more accurate representation, focus on understanding the essence of the topic and then express it in your own words, without relying on a word-for-word rephrasing. A clearer introduction could highlight the increasing health concerns due to obesity and suggest the potential solution of engaging students in school-based exercise programs.

2. **Clarity and Organization**: Your essay benefits from cohesive arguments and good use of examples that demonstrate your points effectively. However, the conclusion could be expanded to more robustly recap your arguments and reinforce your stance. A three-sentence conclusion could provide a concise summary of your points, reiterate the significance of physical education, and offer a final thought on its impact on student health.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor grammatical errors and stylistic issues that distract from the essay's overall clarity. Pay attention to verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement (e.g., ""the number of obese children go down"" should be ""the number of obese children goes down""). Also, consider varying your sentence structure to maintain reader interest and ensure a smooth flow of ideas.

4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: Your arguments in support of physical education are clear and backed by relevant examples. However, enhancing these with more specific details and statistics could strengthen your position further. Mentioning studies or programs that have successfully reduced obesity rates through school exercise initiatives could provide compelling evidence for your argument.

5. **Author's Point of View**: The essay successfully conveys a clear stance in support of increasing physical education in schools to combat obesity. To make your viewpoint even more persuasive, consider exploring counterarguments and addressing why physical education is preferable to other solutions. This will demonstrate a well-rounded understanding of the issue and solidify your position.

In summary, focusing on these areas of improvement can elevate the quality of the essay. Clarifying the initial paraphrasing, expanding the conclusion, refining grammatical and stylistic elements, and bolstering arguments with specific evidence will make for a more persuasive and impactful essay.",3,4,3,3,3,3,4,4,3,1,Argumentative

The parent's attitude developes due to many reason and the continuoation of this trend will bring negative consequences. \n First of all, one of the main factors is the utter care from parent. They always hope the best things for their children such as: a stable job with high salary, a big house, car... Therefore, they make their children to study more, achieve more in life which potentially form the pressure inside the kids. Moreover, some folks are so competitive that they force their children to be more success, more intelligent for them to show off with everyone. \n In my point of view, this development is completely negative which will badly impact on children's life. For example, if the child has to put up with a lot of strees and pressure, they will be mentally ill. They will against their parent's desire and do what they think is right for them. In addtition to that, if the result doesn't live up to their expectation, the children will become depression.

The argument that this pressure has negative consequences is evident throughout the text, which is a strength of the essay. However, to improve the essay and enhance its clarity and effectiveness, several areas need attention.

Firstly, there are spelling errors that need correction to avoid confusion and maintain the professionalism of the essay. Examples include ""developes"" which should be ""develops,"" ""continuoation"" which should be ""continuation,"" ""strees"" should be ""stress,"" ""adtition"" should be ""addition,"" and ""tomorow"" should be ""tomorrow."" Paying attention to spelling is crucial for accurate communication.

Regarding grammar, ensuring the correct use of verb forms and sentence structures will significantly improve the readability of the essay. For example, ""many children have been suffer a considerable amount of stress"" should be corrected to ""many children have been suffering a considerable amount of stress."" Similarly, ""Their future is depend on family's education"" should be ""Their future depends on family education."" These corrections ensure your sentences are grammatically sound and convey your intended message more precisely.

It is also important to use plural forms where necessary. For example, ""due to many reason"" should be ""due to many reasons."" This small change maintains the accuracy of your statements.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more precise language and action words. For instance, instead of saying ""They will against their parent’s desire,"" it would be clearer to say, ""They will go against their parent's desire."" Verb clarity can dramatically improve how your points are understood.

Avoid using contractions in formal essays; ""doesn't"" should be expanded to ""does not."" This change aligns your writing more closely with formal academic standards.

Lastly, the essay occasionally uses language that could be interpreted as overly dramatic or not fully supported by evidence, such as the claim about 20% of children in the world considering suicide. While addressing serious consequences is important, ensure that your statements are backed by reliable sources and presented factually to maintain credibility.

By focusing on these areas of spelling, grammar, accuracy, and the careful presentation of arguments, you can enhance the clarity, professionalism, and persuasiveness of your essays. Keep practicing these aspects, and your writing will continue to improve.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,1,Argumentative

Nevertheless, there have been such typical persons who have achived a lot by virtue of their own natural talent. Let me discuss both the points of view of this issue in the essay before coming to my ultimate standpoint. \n In the first place, innate aptitude definitively contributes a large proportion in the success of many people. It is natural talent of which many geniuses have taken advantages and obtained various success. A good illustration for this is one of the best football players on the world - Messi. He is claimed to have a fascinating talent in playing football when he was a child, and there is no doubt that this kind of skill has noticeably assisted him to be an extraodinary player and to earn a lot of money. Not only football but also other fields such as art emerge similar geniuses, and they prove that natural talent plays such crucial role in success. \n On the other hand, accomplishment is not obtainable without intense training and good instruction. One's talent will be likely to disappear if it is not regconized and reinforced. Had it not been for his coaches, Messi would have never achive such reputation and honour. Talent requires a lot of training and striving in order to be completely perfect. \n All thing considered, there is no doubt that innate talent is a great advantage for one person to gain success.

Always discuss the public opinions evenly.","Your essay tackles the debate on whether training or natural talent is more important for becoming successful in sports or the arts. Your effort to cover both sides of the argument is commendable, but there are areas that can be improved for better clarity and impact.

1. **Response to the Topic:**
   You've addressed the topic by discussing both the importance of natural talent and the necessity of training. However, your personal viewpoint needs to be clearer. Instead of stating you'll discuss both viewpoints before revealing your standpoint, integrate your position from the beginning. This will guide the reader through your essay with a clearer understanding of your argument.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**
   - Spelling mistakes need correction; for example, ""achived"" should be ""achieved"". Paying attention to spelling helps in presenting your argument more professionally.
   - Consider varying your vocabulary. Repeating words like “sport” or “art” can be less engaging. Try synonyms or related terms to maintain the reader’s interest.
   - The essay would benefit from shorter, more direct sentences. This simplifies the language, making your argument easier to follow for readers, including those still learning English.

3. **Clarity of Point of View:**
   Your point of view is implied but not strongly stated. After presenting both sides of the argument, you should explicitly state your personal stance and ensure it's distinguishable from the general discussion. This is missing from your essay, making it harder to grasp your personal perspective.

4. **Arguments and Support:**
   - Your argument about natural talent is well-supported with the example of Messi. However, the argument on the necessity of training needs more development to balance the discussion. Providing another specific example here would strengthen your case.
   - Discussing the viewpoints evenly is crucial. Ensure you dedicate similar efforts to explaining why training is as indispensable as talent. This balance will make your essay more persuasive and comprehensive.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Your concluding paragraph slightly introduces your viewpoint, stating that training and other elements are essential alongside talent. This conclusion can be strengthened by summarizing your arguments more distinctly and reiterating your personal stance confidently.

By addressing these points, you can make your essay more compelling and clear, thereby better engaging your readers and clearly articulating your perspective on the importance of both natural talent and persistent training.

These are extra long sentences tend to distract the reader due to the number of discussions it entails when individualized sentences are required and better for the essay scoring in terms of C&C and GRA scoring considerations.","The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic regarding the media's focus on celebrities' personal lives. However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to enhance the essay’s clarity, structure, and depth.

**1. Structure and Organization:** 
It is recommended to aim for a five-paragraph essay, which includes an opening paragraph, three body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph. This structure not only helps in increasing the word count but also organizes the essay more effectively. Start with a clear introduction where you paraphrase the topic and outline the main points you will discuss. This prepares the reader for what to expect and sets a solid foundation for your argument.

**2. Word Count:** 
Striving for at least 300 words can significantly impact your score positively. More paragraphs mean more space to explore your ideas deeply. Remember, each paragraph should be focused on a single main idea or argument that supports your position.

**3. Clarity and Conciseness:** 
Be cautious of long and complicated sentences. These often make the text harder to follow and can distract the reader. Breaking ideas down into shorter, more manageable sentences can improve the clarity of your essay and make it easier for readers to understand your points. 

**4. Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** 
There are minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay (e.g., ""owner of public media has to sell their products"" might be better as ""owners of public media have to sell their products"" to maintain subject-verb agreement). Additionally, pay attention to the correct spelling of names (e.g., Brad Pitt, not ""Pit"") and consistent tense usage. It is also important to maintain a formal tone throughout your essay.

**5. Clear Point of View:** 
Your point of view on the media's interest in celebrities' personal lives is mentioned but could be stated more explicitly in the introduction and conclusion to strengthen your argument. Providing a clear thesis statement at the end of your introduction can help clarify your stance.

**6. Descriptive and Supportive Arguments:** 
While you provide examples (e.g., the relationship between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie), expanding on these with more details or adding more instances could strengthen your arguments. Each body paragraph should clearly support your thesis with evidence or examples.

To enhance your writing, focus on practice and perseverance. Review essays that successfully use the five-paragraph structure, work on simplifying sentence structures, and always proofread for grammatical and spelling errors.

4512,https://essayforum.com/writing/cap-citizens-salary-86294/,test,Ielts writing task 2: A cap on citizens' salary or not?,"It is true that in several nations there is a minority of people who can achieve a far greater size of salary. While some people argue that this can bring about numerous benefits to a country, others think that a restriction should be imposed on the salary level by the governments. \n On the one hand, it can be argued that the situation in which a few can earn extremely high salaries can benefit a country. Since the high pay is associated with sustained efforts and perseverance, which promotes the idea that only by working hard can you attain what you want in life. This, therefore, drives all people within a country to push themselves hard , creates values and make their greatest contributions to their countries. For example, people in America all know a term called "" American Dream"" and they all exercise a high working spirit to reach their own dreams. This , as a result, shapes the dynamic working attitudes among American and it is their collective efforts that contribute to the leading economic status of the U.S in the world. \n On the other hand, governments should control the size of salary to some degree for some good reasons. Although the policy of applying performance-related salary seems to be reasonable, it might lead to wealth inequality in a long run. In some developed countries, the government still continues to face high poverty rates and this is because governments' budget has already been allocated to the small segment of population. Therefore, by putting a cap on people's salaries, they can create more job opportunies for ignored citizens and thus, combat rising unemployment rates. By doing this, government can ensure a healthier and more sustainable economy growth and the well-being of all citizens. \n In conlusion, even though the outlook of giving advantages to a few in society appears promising, I believe that governments should impose a limit on salaries for more sustainable developments.","Good writing. The problem is that you failed to accomplish a few things in your reasoning presentation: \n - There was no group pronoun reference to the point of view being discussed. This would have helped to show that you were discussing the public point of view as indicated in the original prompt. Without the group pronouns, it appeared that you were discussing your personal opinion in every reasoning paragraph. \n - The personal opinion needs to be justified in the discussion. That should have been presented clearly, with supporting explanations and a relevant example. It is a stand alone paragraph in the essay presentation. \n The proper format for this essay would have been the 5 paragraph approach. As a compare and contrast essay with a personal opinion requirement, it is safer and always best for you to discuss the reasoning paragraphs within 3 presentations. That way you have enough space to present a fully developed explanation for each reason. The most important reason being your personal opinion which, in case your tutor did not tell you, is never presented as a single sentence in the concluding paragraph. \n You cannot conclude your essay with a single sentence opinion because the last paragraph is always reserved as the summary presentation of the total discussion. Hence, it cannot contain an opinion or point of view as that still needs a fully developed explanation. Using it as a closing sentence creates an open ended discussion. That means you did not really conclude the discussion but rather, ran out of ways to explain your opinion. That means your TA score will not meet the highest possible score as you failed to fully explain the discussion in your essay.","The essay presents a balanced view on the topic, discussing both the advantages and disadvantages of high salaries. However, there are areas for improvement to make the argument more compelling and structured.

1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay addresses the topic by discussing two perspectives: the benefits of high salaries and the reasons for government control. Ensure that the essay clearly signals when it is discussing the general point of view versus a personal opinion. This will help clarify whose perspective is being presented at any given time.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling errors (e.g., ""conclusion"" is misspelled as ""conlusion"") and some grammatical issues that can be improved for better clarity and professionalism. Consider revising sentences to avoid redundancy (for example, ""creates values and make their greatest contributions"" could be streamlined).

3. **Point of View Clarity**: It's crucial to distinguish between the discussion of public opinions and your personal stance. The essay sometimes blurs these lines. Using group pronouns more effectively could help demonstrate that you are exploring broader viewpoints rather than solely presenting a personal perspective. Additionally, clearly stating your own opinion as a distinct element of the essay would enhance its effectiveness. This separation ensures that readers understand the various angles being considered.

4. **Arguments and Support**: Each paragraph presents arguments but could benefit from deeper development and more specific examples. The essay would be strengthened by allocating more space to each argument, especially your personal opinion. Instead of briefly concluding with your viewpoint, dedicate a separate paragraph to fully articulate and support it with explanations and relevant examples. This ensures that every part of the discussion is explored thoroughly, making your argument more persuasive.

5. **Structure and Organization**: Adopting a five-paragraph structure may enhance the clarity and flow of your essay. This format allows for an introduction, three body paragraphs (each dedicated to a specific argument or perspective), and a conclusion. Be wary of concluding the essay with a new opinion or idea; the conclusion should summarize the discussion without introducing new information. Fully developed explanations in your conclusion will ensure a stronger, more cohesive essay.

Incorporating these suggestions will not only clarify your position but also strengthen the overall argument and structure of your essay. Remember, clarity and development of ideas are key to effectively conveying your message.",3,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,1,Argumentative

Hopefully you will get better over your succeeding essays. I look forward to your practice tests. Note the problem points for now and try to improve upon them in the next essay.","The essay presented demonstrates a keen interest in advocating for unpaid community work to be integrated into high school curriculums. Your stand on the topic is clear, and you’ve chosen relevant points to support your view. It is commendable that you recognize the multifaceted benefits of engaging in charitable activities, such as the development of life skills, empathy, respect for work and money, and even potential career advantages.

However, the essay could greatly benefit from improvements in several areas to enhance its clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness in conveying your arguments.

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Currently, the essay struggles with smooth transitions between ideas and maintaining a consistent flow of thought. This makes it challenging for the reader to follow your argumentation. To improve, consider planning your essay with a clear structure in mind – introduction, body paragraphs each focusing on one main idea, and a conclusion. Make use of transitional words and phrases to guide the reader through your arguments.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are noticeable issues with punctuation, such as the use of commas followed by ellipses, which disrupt the reading experience. These errors, along with some grammatical inaccuracies, detract from the professionalism of your writing. Paying careful attention to grammar rules and sentence structure can help in conveying your ideas more effectively. Consider revising your essay with a focus on correcting these mistakes.

3. **Lexical Resource**: Expanding your vocabulary and using it accurately is crucial. The essay shows a need for a broader range of vocabulary to express specific ideas more effectively. Engaging with varied English texts and practicing writing can help enhance your lexical resource.

4. **Support Your Arguments**: While the essay mentions several benefits of unpaid community work, these points could be strengthened with more detailed explanations or examples. Elaborating on how these activities specifically contribute to skill development or offer career advantages would provide more substantial support for your argument.

5. **Balance of Ideas**: The mention of needing to balance community work with school lessons is important. Expanding on how this balance can be achieved or why it’s important could enrich your essay and show a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in implementing such programs.

To foster improvement, consider rewriting portions of your essay with these suggestions in mind. Practice is key in developing your writing skills. Reviewing grammar rules, expanding your vocabulary, and organizing your thoughts clearly before writing can greatly enhance the quality of your essays.

A/D,"In recent years, the attitudes towards mobile phone and computers have undergone a seismic shift in the general public, most likely as a result of the development of intelligent technology. Some of them claim that those IT products cause us to gradually lose their communication ability with each other. When it comes to me, I would like to say this view is acceptable to some extent mainly because of the following reasons. \n Those people against using those IT products base on their brief on the fact that it poses a threat to the desire and the skills of the communication face to face. Firstly, some young people gradually lessen conversation with others around because of overly using the cell phone. Plenty of evidence can be found in our daily life to support this, the main one being that a group of teenagers sitting together often exchange information to the others around them with Facebook or Twitter. Secondly, there is a definite link between the lack of speech skills and using those IT products frequently. A recent survey admissioned by Victoria State Government confirms that many college students concern about the performance in the final exam because of the over-dependence of computers. It is, therefore, manifests that those IT products have a detrimental influence on the ability of the communication face to face. \n Mobile phone and computers, on the other hand, pose a positive effect on the efficiency of communication. The other words, many of us have a computer. If we chat with different friends in different countries at the same time, for example, then some programs, like zoom or Webex, can realize our needs immediately. In addition, the cell phone is an economical way to keep our family relations more compactly. \n In conclusion, although the mobile phone and computers are beneficial to our life to some extent, it does harm to the ability of the communication face to face. This issue about mobile phone and computers will become even significantly more than ever before, thus it deserves our further consideration.","You totally changed the discussion slant for this essay.

Then, you did not properly paraphrase the original prompt, which means you did not understand the topic for discussion.

A proper restatement of this prompt would have been: \n <em>The general population have come to rely heavily on gadgets to help them converse with one another. It is believed that this trend has resulted in a lack of personal communication skills. I tend to agree with this belief for a couple of reasons.</em> \n From that point, kick of each of the 2 reasoning paragraphs with a topic sentence.

However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the clarity, relevance, and effectiveness of the argument presented.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay shifts from simply agreeing or disagreeing to discussing the extent to which mobile phones and computers impact interpersonal communication. It is crucial to directly address the prompt and clearly state your agreement or disagreement. A better approach would start by restating the prompt to demonstrate understanding, such as ""The reliance on technology for communication is believed to diminish personal communication skills, a view I align with for several reasons.""

2. **Clarity and Structure:** The essay could benefit from more clear and direct topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to outline the argument's direction. This organization technique helps in presenting a coherent argument and ensures the reader understands the main points being discussed.

3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Word Choice:** Careful attention to word choice and grammar is essential. For example, ""brief"" should be replaced with ""belief,"" and ""admissioned"" is not correct; the right term is ""commissioned."" These mistakes can distract the reader and impact the overall score of the essay. Aim for clear and accurate language rather than focusing on word count. Short, well-structured sentences are often more effective than longer, complex ones.

4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay provides examples to support its points, these arguments could be more detailed and specific. For each claim made, consider providing clear, real-world examples or citing studies to strengthen the argument. It's also important to discuss both sides of the argument but ensure that your viewpoint is clear throughout.

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the essay's main points but could more forcefully reiterate the stance on the topic. Highlighting the need for further consideration underscores the essay's relevance but could be coupled with a stronger statement of your viewpoint.

The only possible score for this would be a 3 based on a number of reasons.

The original prompt for this required you to take a stand either in agreement or disagreement with the point of view tha <em>t ""The benefits of nuclear technology far out-weight the disadvantages.""</em> Since you improperly represented the prompt paraphrasing, you immediately failed the task accuracy portion of the test. It should not be difficult to get a better score in the TA portion. All you have to do is write your paraphrased prompt and then immediately compare it with the original prompt. If your prompt does not follow the original format, then your paraphrasing is wrong. \n The second problem with your essay is that you did not take a clear stand in agreement or disagreement with the prompt. This should have been represented in the paraphrased opening statement as a part of the discussion outline. You instead referred to research sources, which were not clearly identified as such in the essay. This caused another failure on your part in terms of task accuracy. \n The third problem, is that your grammar range and accuracy is highly problematic. While it is possible to make sense out of what you have written, its presentation could use some improvement. The reader might decide to stop reading your work simply because of the grammatical errors that you have in the essay. Try to use simple sentences that depict a clean English sentence instead of trying to be complex and causing the reader undue stress. \n Finally, your conclusion is too short. It has to be made longer, at least 3 sentences in order to properly wrap up the discussion by presenting an updated summary of the previous information presented. If you work on improving all of these points in your next essay, you should manage too show some improvement and perhaps, a slight increase in your score as well.","The essay does touch upon an important subject, which is the role and impact of nuclear technology in energy production and its effects on the environment and society. However, there are several key areas that require attention in order to improve this essay.

1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay needs to directly address the prompt, which asks for a clear stance on whether the benefits of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. It’s crucial to make a definitive statement at the beginning of the essay that clearly shows your position on this issue. This will set the stage for the arguments that follow.

2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** There are numerous grammatical errors that distract from the message you are trying to convey. Consider simplifying your sentence structures to improve clarity. This approach will help in making your essay easier to understand and will reduce the likelihood of grammatical mistakes. Frequent proofreading is also essential to catch and correct these errors.

3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** While you do mention both the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear technology, your own viewpoint is not clearly articulated. It’s vital to explicitly state whether you believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages or vice versa. This will help structure your essay more coherently, guiding the reader through your line of reasoning.

4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position:** While you do present arguments on both sides, these need to be more developed and supported by clear examples or evidence. It's beneficial to strengthen these arguments by delving deeper into each point, rather than simply listing them. This might involve citing specific studies, providing statistics, or giving concrete examples that bolster your position.

Additionally, it's important for the conclusion to effectively summarize the key points made throughout the essay and reinforce your stance on the topic. A conclusion that is too brief fails to provide a satisfying closure to the discussion. At least three sentences in the conclusion would give you the space to recap your arguments and state the significance of your findings.

By addressing these points – ensuring clear response to the prompt, improving grammatical accuracy, articulating a clear viewpoint, and providing solid arguments backed by evidence, as well as expanding the conclusion – the essay would be significantly improved.

1. **Focus on the Prompt:** It seems your essay doesn’t directly address the specific question posed by the prompt. The task was to agree or disagree to a specific statement, yet your response veers off from this direct question. Next time, make sure to clearly state your position regarding the prompt at the beginning and ensure all your arguments relate back to that position throughout your essay.

2. **Support Your Arguments:** While you discuss how computers have transformed various sectors, your essay lacks personal examples or real-life evidence to support these claims. Strong essays usually have one or two key points, each backed by detailed examples. Using personal experiences can make your arguments more convincing. Instead of general “we” statements, try to frame your points through personal lenses - using “I” can make your writing feel more authentic and credible.

3. **Writing Style and Structure:** Beware of informal elements like conjunctions and ellipses (...), as they're not suitable for academic writing. Your sentences and paragraphs also need more variety. A mix of simple and complex structures can make your essay more interesting and easier to read. Additionally, each paragraph should have at least three sentences to be considered complete. Aim for clarity and precision in your language to maintain a formal tone.

4. **Grammar and Spelling:** Double-check for spelling errors, as these can distract from your message. Similarly, pay attention to grammar - for instance, “computes” should be “computers,” and “complexed questions” should be “complex questions”. Errors like these can undermine the professionalism of your essay.

5. **Privacy Concerns:** You briefly touched on the importance of privacy, but expanding on this point with personal insights or examples could make your argument stronger. It’s an area that could benefit from more depth, showing a critical evaluation of the use of computers in our lives.

Remember, every essay is a learning opportunity. Focusing on these aspects can not only improve your writing but also enhance your ability to express your thoughts more effectively.

It's evident you have strong feelings about this subject and its benefits, including cultural understanding, making friends from other countries, and personal growth.

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea you'll discuss. Your essay currently jumps from one idea to another without clear connections, making it hard for readers to follow your argument. For example, when you start discussing the benefits of learning about another's culture through language, introduce this idea more clearly at the beginning of the paragraph.

2. **Grammar and Structure**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout your essay that could confuse readers. Subjects in some sentences seem to be missing, and verb tenses do not always agree. Spend some time reviewing basic English grammar rules, focusing on subject-verb agreement, the correct use of articles (""a,"" ""an,"" and ""the""), and sentence structure. For instance, instead of saying ""Many people would face a question that why we should learn second language,"" consider ""Many people wonder why we should learn a second language.""

3. **Vocabulary and Expression**: It's important to have a strong vocabulary to express your ideas clearly. However, using complex words incorrectly can make sentences difficult to understand. Strive for clarity and simplicity in your language, and use a dictionary to check the meaning and usage of words you're unsure about. 

4. **Supporting Arguments**: While you mention several benefits of learning a second language, your arguments could be strengthened by providing specific examples. For example, when mentioning making friends from other countries, share a brief story or hypothetical situation that shows how this can lead to meaningful exchanges and understanding.

In conclusion, focusing on clear structure and coherence, correcting grammatical errors, simplifying your language for clarity, and providing specific examples to support your arguments will greatly improve your essay.
